Social media videos show bodies trapped under rubble and debris.\n\nRSF has not commented on the incident. The paramilitary group has been engaged in a raging civil war with the Sudanese Armed Forces since April 2023 but since the army\u2019s capture of the capital, Khartoum, in March, the RSF has been fighting to maintain territorial dominance of Darfur, its stronghold.\n\nEl Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, is the last remaining capital in the region controlled by the Sudanese army and has been under siege for more than a year.\n\nResearch from Yale University\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab shows RSF is building an earthen wall around El Fasher to trap people inside.\n\nSatellite imagery released by the lab on Thursday showed RSF forces advancing in many areas, including around the Abu Shouk camp and the former peacekeeping base for United Nations-African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur (Unamid), now used by anti-RSF joint forces.\n\nThe city and the camp have been under an intensifying assault in recent months, experiencing artillery shelling and drone strikes.\n\nBrutal attacks there killed at least 89 civilians over a 10-day period last month, with the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) saying some appeared to have been summary executions.\n\nLast week, at least 13 people were killed in shelling of the city by RSF.\n\nA new report by the OHCHR said at least 3,384 civilians were killed between January and June, mostly in Darfur \u2013 a figure representing nearly 80% of civilian casualties in Sudan last year.\n\nMost of the killings were caused by artillery shelling and air and drone strikes in densely populated areas, and many deaths happened during the RSF\u2019s offensive on El Fasher as well as the Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps in April, the report said.\n\nThe UN and rights groups have in the past reported that some killings have been ethnically targeted.\n\nEl Fasher is under a communications blackout, making it difficult to verify casualties or coordinate aid. At a briefing on Tuesday on the situation in the city organised by Avaaz, an advocacy group, participants talked of dire and deteriorating conditions in the city due to the assaults.\n\nFatima, an artist and lecturer who works with displaced communities in North Darfur, said civilians in El Fasher were enduring deliberate shelling, rapid deaths, slow deaths, injuries, starvation, disease, intimidation and other inhumane practices daily. \u201cThis is a real catastrophe,\u201d she said.\n\nMohammad Duda, spokesperson of Zamzam camp in North Darfur, said people in El Fasher were \u201cbeing forced to hide in buried shipping containers as makeshift shelters\u201d. He appealed to the international community \u201cto intervene immediately and save the people of El Fasher from this catastrophic humanitarian crisis\u201d.\n\nAvaaz expressed concern that if El Fasher fell, RSF could carry out ethnically targeted attacks, as reported afer the capture of Zamzam this year and in Geneina in 2023."

                "text": "Earlier this month, my mother and I took the train from Samarkand, Uzbekistan, to the city of Bukhara, two and a half hours away. While I was waiting in line for the toilet, an Uzbek train attendant approached to express his delight at the hoodie I was wearing, which is black with a Palestinian flag and the words \u201cFree Palestine\u201d in both English and Arabic.\n\nDuring our ensuing conversation in modified English, the young man advised me to steer clear of Wagon Seven of the train, as it was full of Israeli tourists. He himself had requested to be reassigned from said wagon, he told me, so as to avoid having to deal with them. He proceeded to wonder how people could live with themselves while their government was slaughtering children en masse.\n\nIndeed, of the more than 65,000 Palestinians Israel has officially killed in less than two years in the Gaza Strip \u2013 likely a severe underestimate \u2013 nearly 20,000 have been children. This is to say nothing of the countless kids who have been permanently maimed, mutilated and traumatised.\n\nBefore arriving in Bukhara, the train attendant suggested we document our sweatshirt-based encounter with a selfie. In the photo, he gave the thumbs up for Palestine, and then my mother and I were on our way.\n\nThis was not the first time that this particular hoodie had attracted attention. The previous week in the security line at the airport in Istanbul, an Arab woman travelling with her family asked to photograph the shirt. Then the female security guard who patted me down informed me, in Turkish, that I was a \u201cgood person\u201d.\n\nGenerally having a rather different opinion of myself, I inquired as to how she had possibly come to this conclusion, and was told that any American citizen who supported Palestine was automatically a good person.\n\nTo be sure, the United States has not done much for its international reputation by avidly backing Israel\u2019s genocide from the get-go, first under former President Joe Biden and now under Donald Trump. In addition to providing billions upon billions of dollars to the Israeli killing machine, the US has also provided it with far-reaching diplomatic cover, including by vetoing six United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nHands down, the most unexpected compliment I have thus far received on the Free Palestine hoodie came from an agent with the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) \u2013 which doesn\u2019t exactly have the greatest reputation either \u2013 at none other than Dulles International Airport outside the nation\u2019s capital of Washington, DC.\n\nIt was last October, one year into the genocidal spectacle, and I was flying to Mexico City. While scanning my passport, the agent, an older white man, said he liked my shirt and lamented the ongoing horror in Gaza. He went on to ask if I had read any books by Israeli anti-Zionist historian Ilan Pappe, author of The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine and other titles, as I stared at him in shock.\n\nGranted, this was several months before Trump reassumed the presidency and went about effectively criminalising opposition to genocide by abducting and disappearing students and scholars who had expressed support for Gaza.\n\nFree Palestine apparel has earned me plenty of other friends, too. There was the Sudanese human rights lawyer-turned-ride-share driver in Washington who gave me a hug, the woman in the Athens airport who commented \u201cLong live Palestine\u201d, and the United Airlines flight attendant who whispered to me almost conspiratorially that he approved of my outfit.\n\nIt may appear that the garment\u2019s popularity is restricted to the context of travel by plane, train, and so forth \u2013 an impression that has to do with various factors. The first is that I travel a lot, having suffered for most of my life from a pathological inability to sit still. The second is that I am always freezing in airports, which got me to thinking that if I must wear a sweater, it might as well be a Free Palestine one.\n\nAnd yet it is undeniably grotesque that, thanks purely to a passport bestowed on me by the number one abettor of mass slaughter and enforced starvation in Gaza, I am able to jaunt freely around the world in a Free Palestine hoodie, while the Palestinians of Gaza are trapped within the borders of a tiny strip of land that Israel has converted into an open-air exhibition of some of the worst atrocities known to humanity.\n\nAlthough the black hoodie is currently serving as my official travel uniform, I have it in blue, as well. I also have a Palestinian flag dress, a Palestinian flag facemask, and two Palestine football shirts, one of which I wore last year when I entered the Darien Gap \u2013 the notorious stretch of roadless territory and perilous jungle straddling Colombia and Panama that has become a veritable graveyard for international refuge seekers.\n\nIn recent years, hundreds of thousands of the world\u2019s have-nots have been forced to risk their lives crossing the Darien Gap in the hopes of eventually reaching the US. During my own brief journalistic incursion, I met two men from Yemen \u2013 itself no stranger to US-backed terror \u2013 who pronounced my Palestine shirt \u201cvery good\u201d and offered their assistance in case I needed anything in the jungle.\n\nMeanwhile, the only negative feedback to the Palestine hoodie that I can recall took place in February of this year in the city of Mazatlan in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa, home of the eponymous drug cartel. It is also home to a number of archetypal gringo \u201cexpats\u201d, who often do not bother to learn Spanish and who apparently detect no irony in taking advantage of Mexico\u2019s lower living costs while simultaneously endorsing Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign \u2013 which affects a whole lot of Mexicans \u2013 just across the border.\n\nOne such gringo caricature was personally offended by my hoodie, and took it upon himself to shout belligerently: \u201cSo you support Hamas?!\u201d I responded in decidedly impolite fashion, and my Mexican companion and I returned to our beers.\n\nObviously, my Free Palestine sweatshirt is not going to stop a genocide. It is not going to undo the Israeli strike on the home of 10-year-old Noor Faraj or give the child her two legs back. It is not going to resuscitate Palestinian newborns who have been starved to death.\n\nBut in a world that is rapidly going to hell, it has at least made for some fleetingly uplifting moments."

And that hackneyed cliche still works \u2026 \"The more things change \u2026 The more they stay the same\".\n\nWhich is not to say the three weeks we\u2019ve stayed here this time have been dull. There have been more ups and downs than a run-down roller coaster at an old Luna Park.\n\nOur first field shoot was appropriately enough to visit released hostages and families of captives of Hamas. Because, for the majority of Israelis, this is one of the most important topics. 48 people held by terrorists, 20 still alive. Their time of imprisonment, the nearly 2 years of this Gaza war.\n\nSPAIN'S PRIME MINISTER SPARKS OUTRAGE OVER ALLEGED NUCLEAR THREAT AGAINST ISRAEL\n\nWe met the families on Day 700 of the hostages\u2019 captivity. Lishay Lava-Mira begged for her husband Omri to come home. Liron Berman was sure his twin brothers would make it (\"They\u2019re strong\"). And Keith Siegel, a hostage, himself, for close to 500 days, articulate and healthy, looked beyond the Israeli government for help. \"I call upon Trump to continue his efforts.\"\n\nEarly in our stay there was hope a new peace plan from the U.S. might gain traction. All 48 hostages would be released in exchange for 3,000 Palestinian prisoners, and a cease-fire to assess the next steps.\n\nThat seemingly reasonable plan took hits left, right and center.\n\nCRUZ SLAMS UN'S ISRAEL \u2018GENOCIDE\u2019 CHARGE, PUSHES FOR CONSEQUENCES\n\nFirst a horror we learned about as we\u2019d finished a quick breakfast at our hotel. Two gunmen shooting up a busy commuter bus and bus stop in Jerusalem, leaving six dead and many more injured. The scenes were horrific and the actions to eliminate the terrorists brave.\n\nThen the next morning, as cameraman Ben and I were doing a routine round-up of the news on the hotel balcony we call home, I noticed in the corner of my eye longtime and dedicated producer Yael inside our studio room jumping up and down.\n\nIsrael had done the unthinkable, targeting Hamas leadership in what should have been the neutral zone of Doha, Qatar. The militants claimed they were discussing the peace plan at the time. That U.S. proposal became as dead as any victims the Israelis managed to hit (apparently no leadership).\n\nAnd then to put the final \"paid\" to peace talks. The much-touted full-scale ground invasion of Gaza City by Israel was launched. To finish off some 3,000 remaining Hamas fighters and their infrastructure. As Netanyahu put it \"What starts in Gaza (the ugly Hamas massacre and hostage-taking of Oct. 7.) ends in Gaza.\"\n\nAnd this is when the frustration sets in for grizzled combat reporters like me, and our top-notch war team of camera Ben, Producer Yael, and Security Rob. As they have throughout the war, Israel limiting access to the Gaza action.\n\nSo we depend on local journalists to show us the horror. The destroyed urban scene. And most importantly, the vast and ugly images of human suffering. Hundreds of thousands of civilians, many not Hamas supporters, having to deal with the living hell that the terrorists and the fighting have imposed on them.\n\nRemember that line, \"I wouldn\u2019t wish this on my worst enemy\"? Well, maybe I\u2019d go with it regarding Hamas, but not these poor Palestinian children who know nothing of the geopolitics of the situation.\n\nTo their credit, IDF officials tell us they are moving slowly through the lunar landscape that is now Gaza. Careful not to endanger civilians and /or hostages. Somehow, with Hamas-backed local health officials indicating 65,000 have already been killed after 2 years of war, it seems somewhat after the fact.\n\nBut that means, again, according to the officials we\u2019ve spoken to, this whole Gaza City process could take as long as four months to complete. Too long for the morale-sapped reservists fighting the war. Too long for the inhabitants enduring it all. Too long for the desperate hostages.\n\nUnless there\u2019s a breakthrough.\n\nNo wonder the locals here look to President Donald Trump and/or a range of countries, bodies, figures (yes, Pope Leo) to try to intercede beyond the local leaders, Israel\u2019s past duels with foes like Hezbollah and Iran seemed like well-tuned 21st century war-making. The fighting in Gaza is more like early 20th century ugly World War I trench warfare.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn between our live shots and reporting in Tel Aviv, we occasionally nip out to a few of the bars and restaurants that dot this seaside metropolis\u2014despite all, running full tilt. And wonder what this country would be like, as well, of course, what it would be like for the wonderfully diverse Palestinian population without the yoke of war around their shoulders.\n\nNo answers this trip."

                "text": "A collaboration between African and American researchers and a community living in one of the most hostile landscapes of northern Kenya has uncovered key genetic adaptations that explain how pastoralist people have been able to thrive in the region.\n\nUnderlying the population\u2019s abilities to live in Turkana, a place defined by extreme heat, water scarcity and limited vegetation, has been hundreds of years of natural selection, according to a study published in Science.\n\nIt shows how the activity of key human genes has changed over millennia and the findings place \u201cTurkana and sub-Saharan Africa at the forefront of genomic research, a field where Indigenous populations have historically been underrepresented\u201d, according to Charles Miano, one of the study\u2019s co-authors and a postgraduate student at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri).\n\nThe research sequenced 367 whole genomes and analysed more than 7m genetic variants, identifying several regions of the genome under natural selection. It was conducted through the Turkana Health and Genomics Project (THGP), an initiative bringing together researchers from Kenya and the US, including Kemri, the Turkana Basin Institute (TBI), Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe genomic analysis found eight regions of DNA that had undergone natural selection but one gene, STC1, expressed in the kidneys, showed exceptionally strong evidence of humans adapting to extreme environments. Evidence included the body\u2019s response to dehydration and processing purine-rich foods such as meat and blood, staples of the Turkana people\u2019s diet.\n\nTurkana stretches across a large swathe of northern Kenya, one of the most arid regions in the world, where shade is scarce and water even more rare. Rainfall arrives in short, unpredictable bursts, and securing enough water for themselves and their herds of cattle, goats and camels is a daily chore. Fetching water can involve journeys of many hours each day across hot terrain devoid of vegetation.\n\nAbout 70% to 80% of the community\u2019s diet comes from animal sources, mostly milk, blood and meat, reflecting resourcefulness and adaptation to scarcity, which is common among pastoralist societies around the world living in environments where crops cannot grow and where markets are too far away to be accessed on foot.\n\nYet, after years of documenting the Turkana people\u2019s lifestyle and studying blood and urine samples to assess their health, researchers found that, although the community consumes too much purine, which should lead to gout, the condition rarely appears among the Turkana.\n\n\u201cAbout 90% of the people assessed were dehydrated but generally healthy,\u201d said Prof Julien Ayroles, from the University of California, Berkeley, one of the project\u2019s co-principal investigators. \u201cThe Turkana have maintained their traditional way of life for thousands of years, providing us with an extraordinary window into human adaptation.\u201d\n\nGenetic adaptations are believed to have emerged about 5,000 years ago, coinciding with the aridification of northern Africa, the study suggesting that as the region became drier, natural selection favoured variants that enhanced survival under arid conditions.\n\n\u201cThis research demonstrates how our ancestors adapted to dramatic climate shifts through genetic evolution,\u201d said Dr Epem Esekon, responsible for Turkana county\u2019s health and sanitation sector.\n\nHowever, as more members of the Turkana community move to towns and cities, the same adaptations that once protected them may now increase risks of chronic lifestyle diseases, a phenomenon known as \u201cevolutionary mismatch\u201d. This occurs when adaptations shaped by one environment become liabilities in another, highlighting how rapid lifestyle changes interact with deep evolutionary history.\n\nWhen the researchers compared biomarkers and gene expression \u2013 the process by which information encoded in a gene is turned into a function \u2013 in the genomes of city-dwelling Turkana people with their kin still living in the villages, they found an imbalance of gene expression that may predispose them to chronic diseases such as hypertension or obesity, which are more common in urban settings where diets, water availability and activity patterns are radically different.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding these adaptations will guide health programmes for the Turkana, especially as some shift from traditional pastoralism to city life,\u201d said Miano.\n\nAs the world faces rapid environmental change, the Turkana people\u2019s story offers inspiration and practical insights. For generations, the researchers said, this community has developed and maintained sophisticated strategies for surviving in a challenging and variable environment, knowledge that becomes increasingly valuable as the climate crisis creates new survival challenges.\n\nFor close to a decade, the project centred on co-production of knowledge, combining genomic science with ecological and anthropological expertise. The agenda emerged from dialogue with Turkana elders, scientists, chiefs and community members, conversations about health, diet and change, often in the evening around a campfire.\n\n\u201cWorking with the Turkana has been transformative for this study,\u201d said Dr Sospeter Ngoci Njeru, a co-principal investigator and deputy director at Kemri\u2019s Centre for Community Driven Research. \u201cTheir insights into their environment, lifestyle and health have been essential to connecting our genetic findings to real-world biology and survival strategies.\u201d\n\nDr Dino Martins, director of the TBI, says the deep ecological connection and the adaptation to one of the Earth\u2019s hottest and most arid environments provides lessons for how climate continues to shape human biology and health. \u201cThe discovery adds another important piece of knowledge to our wider understanding of human evolution,\u201d he said.\n\nResearchers say other pastoralist communities in similar environments in east Africa, including the Rendille, Samburu, Borana, Merille, Karamojong and Toposa, are likely to share this adaptation.\n\nThe research team will create a podcast in the Turkana language to share the study\u2019s findings and also plan to offer the community practical health considerations that arise from rapidly changing lifestyles."

She said she would \u201ccontinue to challenge any last-minute, vexatious attempts to frustrate a removal in the courts\u201d.\n\nThe returns agreement had faced growing scrutiny after reports of flights for removals being cancelled earlier this week.\n\nAnother Eritrean man successfully asked the high court on Tuesday to temporarily block his deportation after the judge found there was a \u201cserious issue to be tried\u201d over whether his removal was lawful amid claims he had been trafficked.\n\nBut on Thursday, in the second legal challenge brought against the Home Office over the deal, the same judge refused the migrant\u2019s application for interim relief before a full legal challenge against the decision to deport him.\n\nBarristers for the man, who cannot be named, had argued that the decision was \u201cprocedurally unfair\u201d as he had not been given sufficient opportunity to put forward evidence supporting his claim that he was an \u201calleged trafficking victim\u201d.\n\nIn a ruling, Mr Justice Sheldon said \u201cthere is no serious issue to be tried in this case\u201d and that the man gave differing accounts of his allegations of trafficking.\n\nMinisters agreed the pilot scheme with the French government in July as part of efforts to deter the record number of arrivals by small boat.\n\nHours after the first removal under the agreement, Trump urged the prime minister to involve the military.\n\nAt a joint Chequers press conference with the prime minister, the president highlighted his own record in securing the US borders and suggested the UK faced a similar challenge.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou have people coming in and I told the prime minister I would stop it, and it doesn\u2019t matter if you call out the military, it doesn\u2019t matter what means you use.\n\n\u201cIt destroys countries from within and we\u2019re actually now removing a lot of the people that came into our country.\u201d"

The brigade's flag is pinned up behind him.\n\nThe aspiring long-distance runner says he was tricked into joining the Russian army and is desperate to go home to see his 16-year-old daughter.\n\nIn a Facebook post accompanying the video, the 57th Separate Motorised Infantry Brigade said it was an example of how Russia treats foreign recruits but added that he had \"fought on the side of the enemy, so whether to believe the words and tears is up to your discretion\".\n\nThe brigade said the interview was filmed with Kibet's consent, but the BBC has not verified this. Though recruits from abroad in the Russian army are not unheard of, this is a rare case of a captive foreigner speaking on video.\n\nCitizens of Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba and Sri Lanka , among others, are currently held in Ukrainian prisoner-of-war camps, Petro Yatsenko, Ukraine's spokesperson on the treatment of prisoners of war, told the BBC.\n\n\"Most of these individuals come from poorer countries and end up on the Russian side in different ways. Some are deceived \u2013 promised jobs at factories \u2013 while others join the war voluntarily. It is important to understand that very few are captured alive; most are either killed or seriously injured,\" he added.\n\nBack in Kenya, Kibet's family and friends are in shock over what they have seen.\n\nAfter a heavy sigh and a long pause, his cousin Edith Chesoi told the BBC that she had been replaying the video over and over in her head.\n\n\"I am so traumatised. I didn't sleep at night. I don't even know what to say.\"\n\nKibet's younger brother, Isaac Kipyego, described him as \"humble guy and a man with a few words\" as well as a pillar and advisor to the rest of the family.\n\nThey know him as someone dedicated to his sport.\n\n\"I love running, I love running,\" Kibet says on the Ukrainian video. And it was this that may have led him to becoming an unwitting Russian recruit.\n\nKibet had built his life around athletics, a sport that has lifted many Kenyans like him from villages to global recognition.\n\nHe grew up in a farming family from the Mount Elgon area in western Kenya.\n\nKibet trained in Iten, the high-altitude town famed for producing Olympians and world champions, but in a competitive field he never reached that status. Instead, he competed in lesser-known 10km and half-marathon road races in Europe and Asia, according to family and friends.\n\n\"Kibet has been running since he was a child,\" his younger brother said. \"He's always been talented. Running was his life.\"\n\nBut while the sport defined his identity, it had not delivered the financial breakthrough he longed for.\n\nFriends say Kibet had been struggling financially.\n\nIn March, he asked a training partner, Elias Kiptum, to help him race in Poland, but the team that was going was already full.\n\n\"I guess that's how he ended up in Russia,\" Kiptum told the BBC.\n\nWhen, later in the year, a sports agent offered him a trip to Russia to take part in races, Kibet seized the opportunity. The BBC's calls to the agent to confirm this have not been picked up.\n\n\"He was very excited when he told me he was going to race in Russia,\" Kibet's brother said. \"Even I was happy for him. We had high expectations.\"\n\nHis cousin, Ms Chesoi, who escorted him to the bus park on the first leg of the journey at the end of July, said he carried just \"a small-sized suitcase\".\n\nKibet told his family he would only be gone for two weeks.\n\nOn the video filmed in Ukraine, Kibet says that he went to Russia as a visitor and not for a \"military job\".\n\nThen, after a fortnight, his host asked him if he would like to stay longer.\n\n\"I said: 'Yes, but the problem is that my visa is expired'. He said: 'No, I can do something for you.'\" And then he promised Kibet a job.\n\n\"In the evening, he came with some papers written in Russian. He told me: 'This is the job I want you to do.'\n\n\"I didn't know it was a military job.\"\n\nKibet says he then signed the papers and the man took his phone and passport.\n\n\"And that is how everything went wrong... that signing ruined my life.\"\n\n'Either you fight or we'll kill you'\n\nAccording to Kibet, some other people turned up and told him to get in a car. They then drove for around seven hours.\n\n\"I found myself in a military camp.\"\n\nKibet says he was informed that he had signed up to be in the army and that he had no choice.\n\n\"I was told: 'Either you go to fight or we'll kill you.'\"\n\nHe says a week of basic training followed, during which he was shown how to handle an automatic rifle. None of his commanders spoke English, so instructions came through shoves and gestures.\n\nKibet insists he never engaged in combat and then on the way to what would have been his first mission, he ditched his equipment and escaped, wandering for two days through a forest near Vovchansk in Ukraine's north-eastern Kharkiv region.\n\nHe then approached some Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n\"I went there with my hands up,\" he says repeating the gesture for the camera.\n\n\"I said: 'I am a Kenyan, please don't shoot me.'\n\n\"Everyone pointed their guns at me, but I told them to calm down. The commander came, they tied me. I told them: 'No, I am unarmed, I don't want anything. I'm here to save my life.\"\n\nDespite Kibet's family being in shock over the video, there is some relief that he is in the hands of the Ukrainians.\n\n\"We feel that he's a bit safe [with them] rather than being in Russia,\" his brother Mr Kipyego said.\n\nThe family is asking the Kenyan authorities to intervene. The ministry of foreign affairs has not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\n\"If the government of his country of origin expresses interest in his repatriation, Ukraine is open to negotiations about transferring him home,\" Ukrainian spokesperson Mr Yatsenko said.\n\nHowever, speaking about other prisoners-of-war, he added that \"most African states show little interest in the return of such citizens and do not wish to take them back\".\n\nFor Kibet's loved ones, their only priority is his safety.\n\n\"If he made a mistake, let them forgive him. We only want him back,\" his brother said.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica"

That comprises just more than half of the planet\u2019s seabed.\n\nNow that the treaty is law, a decision-making body, a Conference of the Parties (COP), will have to work with regional and global organisations that already oversee different aspects of the oceans, such as the International Seabed Authority.\n\nDeep-Sea mining risks\n\nOne aspect of the Marine Biodiversity Treaty is to ensure that countries can work towards more fair and equitable sharing of benefits from activities related to marine biodiversity beyond the borders of any one nation, as a handful of governments and companies push to rapidly expand deep-sea mining.\n\nEnvironmentalists say the potential consequences of dredging the ocean floor used to extract deep-sea minerals are difficult to calculate and range from endangering ancient lifeforms like dumbo octopuses and twilight zone corals to causing further distress to whales by distorting their sonar communication.\n\nAt least 38 countries are calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until more is known about its potential harm to marine ecosystems, including those which have yet to be explored.\n\nThey include island states like the Marshall Islands and Vanuatu, as well as bigger countries like Brazil and the United Kingdom, while other countries, including the US under Trump, and the small Pacific island nation of Nauru, want to press ahead.\n\nInternational efforts continue\n\nThe Marine Biodiversity Treaty is the latest example of continued efforts to combat environmental threats at the global level, despite pushback from some governments.\n\nEarlier this year, countries at the UN shipping agency struck a deal on a global fuel emissions standard for the maritime sector, which will impose an emissions fee on dirty fuels and reward vessels that reduce their emissions.\n\nThe deal was reached after the US pulled out of the climate talks at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London and threatened to impose \u201creciprocal measures\u201d against any fees charged to US ships.\n\nIn August, global talks to develop a landmark treaty to tackle plastic pollution failed to reach an agreement, amid deadlock at the sixth round of talks in under three years.\n\nBut in July, the UN\u2019s highest court found that countries must meet their climate obligations, and that failing to do so could violate international law, potentially opening the door for affected nations to seek reparations in future legal cases.\n\nVanuatu\u2019s minister for climate change, Ralph Regenvanu, who led the case at the International Court of Justice, reacted to the Marine Biodiversity Treaty entering into force, saying: \u201cEverything that affects the ocean affects us.\u201d"

Despite a law requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest significantly, the legality of the proposed deal remains uncertain, with potential licensing of TikTok's algorithm raising compliance issues. The situation highlights a broader disregard for the enforcement of laws by the Trump administration, with bipartisan political silence on the matter, as both parties grapple with the implications of TikTok's popularity among younger voters.",
                "source": "Politico - Congress",
                "text": "On Friday, Trump is set to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping to agree to the terms of a proposed deal that is supposed to finally end the TikTok drama and bring all parties into compliance with the law. The deal reportedly involves some sort of sale to a consortium of investors that may include Trump allies and billionaires like Larry Ellison and Marc Andreessen, though the structure and legality of the agreement remain unclear. Indeed, whatever happens Friday is not likely to end the matter.\n\nThe law passed by Congress and signed into law under Joe Biden requires TikTok\u2019s Beijing-based parent company ByteDance to divest at least 80 percent of its financial stake in the company and also precludes \u201cany cooperation\u201d concerning \u201cthe operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.\u201d Earlier this week, however, a Chinese cybersecurity official said that the framework includes \u201clicensing the [TikTok] algorithm and other intellectual property rights.\u201d Depending on the specifics, that licensing arrangement, with its \u201clethal algorithm\u201d intact, could run afoul of the law. What then?\n\nSome Republican China hawks on Capitol Hill insisted this week that they will closely scrutinize the deal when the terms become clearer, but there has been almost no pushback from Republicans over Trump\u2019s decision to unilaterally ignore the TikTok ban all year \u2014 and far less from Democrats than one might have expected.\n\nCotton did not respond to a request for comment about Trump\u2019s continuing refusal to enforce the law, despite being a once-voluble critic of TikTok and the Chinese government\u2019s control of the app and arguing that the app has already \u201ccost the lives of many American kids.\u201d\n\nA representative for Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri told me that if I wanted to hear from him on the matter, I was free to track him down in the Capitol. Hawley previously defended the ban and warned of the dangers of TikTok in January, shortly before Trump returned to office and announced that the administration would simply ignore it. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a national security threat,\u201d Hawley said of TikTok at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal security threat.\u201d\n\nTrump himself once shared these concerns. In 2020, he signed an executive order declaring that TikTok\u2019s data collection \u201cthreatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans\u2019 personal and proprietary information \u2014 potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, was before Trump courted a billionaire donor with a stake in TikTok and before Trump decided that TikTok had helped him win his 2024 reelection bid. Last month, the White House created an official TikTok account \u2014 a further sign, if one was needed, of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing disregard for the ban passed by Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has benefited from an apparent lack of coordination and urgency on the Democratic side of the aisle.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted for the ban but later opposed immediate implementation of the law in January and endorsed a legislative extension before the law went into effect. That did not pass, but Trump has kept TikTok alive anyway without apparent legal authority to do so. Schumer did not respond to a request for comment on Trump\u2019s series of TikTok executive orders this year.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, for his part, opposed the TikTok ban in the first place but said that he is waiting to see more about the deal before rendering a final opinion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working to make sure this deal does not lead to the censorship of free speech and will protect the millions of content creators who rely on TikTok,\u201d he told POLITICO Magazine.\n\nThe whole situation has no apparent precedent in the annals of American law.\n\nSure, there are lots of laws on the books, and the federal government cannot enforce them all. That is why federal law enforcement relies heavily on priority-setting and careful attention to the opportunity costs of pursuing some crimes over others.\n\nThe Trump administration has made its agenda clear, and the ramifications have not been surprising. If, for example, you insist that federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors focus almost entirely on illegal immigration, then you are going to have fewer investigations and prosecutions for white-collar crime and financial fraud \u2014 which is exactly what is happening now.\n\nIn February, Trump announced that he was \u201cpausing\u201d enforcement of the foreign anti-bribery statute \u2014 a law that he notoriously hates \u2014 and in June, the Justice Department issued a memo that dramatically narrowed the circumstances under which the administration would enforce the law. In less overt fashion, the Justice Department has also significantly de-prioritized public corruption investigations, which Trump also hates.\n\nReasonable minds can often disagree about which federal laws merit the Justice Department\u2019s focus at any given point in time, but the TikTok ban stands apart both for its public and political salience, as well as its simplicity.\n\nThe law passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress and was unanimously affirmed on constitutional grounds by the Supreme Court. In the wake of the murder of Charlie Kirk, the country is also now engaged in a national, rolling public debate about the polarizing and radicalizing dangers of social media, particularly on America\u2019s youth.\n\nThe TikTok ban is also not subtle or particularly complicated to implement. It states that the Justice Department \u201cshall conduct investigations related to potential violations\u201d of the ban by tech companies, including third-party service providers, and that the Justice Department \u201cshall pursue enforcement\u201d if a violation has occurred. The fines that are supposed to apply are massive, potentially adding up to billions of dollars.\n\nInstead of abiding by this provision, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote letters to Apple, Google and other tech companies earlier this year informing them that she was effectively immunizing them for any violations of the law. She argued that enforcing the ban would \u201cinterfere with the execution of the President\u2019s constitutional duties to take care of the national security and foreign affairs of the United States.\u201d\n\nLeft unsaid was how this decision would comply with the president\u2019s constitutional obligation to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\u201d how it could be squared with Congress\u2019 constitutional lawmaking authority, or why we should all be okay with the administration unilaterally disregarding the American public\u2019s interest in having the executive branch enforce the laws passed by their elected representatives.\n\nThe TikTok ban may or may not be good on the merits. You may hate it or you may love it, but it is the law of the land \u2014 and it has been all year.\n\nIf the ban was a bad idea, then Congress could have repealed the law or passed a legislative extension, but neither of those things has happened. Instead, pretty much every politician in Washington \u2014 on both sides of the aisle \u2014 has effectively decided that the law can be flagrantly ignored because of TikTok\u2019s popularity and the potential electoral fallout that could result from antagonizing the app\u2019s relatively young user base.\n\nThis is not how laws are supposed to work in this country.\n\nCongress is supposed to pass them, and the president is supposed to enforce them. There are no constitutional carve-outs for popular social media apps or for companies that helped you win your election.\n\nOver the last eight months, the Trump administration has run roughshod over Congress and its constitutional prerogatives. Trump\u2019s decision to ignore the TikTok ban on his first day in office may seem minor in the grand scheme of things, but it foreshadowed a series of far more aggressive moves to usurp much of lawmakers\u2019 constitutional authority: dismantling congressionally-created agencies, redirecting congressionally appropriated funds and implementing a massive tax hike on the American public in the form of Trump\u2019s chaotic tariff regime.\n\nThe vast majority of this was made possible by congressional Republicans, who have largely turned a blind eye to all of Trump\u2019s gambits, and by the Republican appointees on the Supreme Court, who have handed Trump a series of victories this year in his wide-ranging efforts to both unilaterally slash the federal government while dramatically expanding the powers of the presidency.\n\nThe acquiescence to Trump\u2019s TikTok reprieve this year has been a far more bipartisan affair, but it has been a constitutional farce all the same, and it is not over yet."

TikTok approval\u201d, the version from Beijing was not as clear.\n\n\u201cOn TikTok, Xi said China\u2019s position is clear: the Chinese government respects the will of firms and welcomes companies to conduct business negotiations on the basis of market rules to reach a solution consistent with Chinese laws and regulations while balancing interests,\u201d according to the meeting summary in Xinhua, the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nExperts were not surprised.\n\n\u201cTrump is the type of person who often announces frameworks or deals to have deals or a deal that still has a lot of details to be worked out, and this seems to be another example of that,\u201d said Rachel Ziemba, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nThe bigger trade deal is likely to wait till Trump and Xi meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that starts on October 31 in Gyeongju in South Korea, \u201cif that happens\u201d, added Ziemba.\n\nDespite the lack of any specific developments from Friday\u2019s call, experts agree that the leaders talking is in itself a sign of a thaw, especially as Xi had previously refused to get on the phone with Trump, despite the multiple meetings in Geneva, London and most recently in Madrid.\n\n\u201cAt least they have broken ice after a long while, and it seems like they are ready to negotiate other more difficult issues,\u201d said Wei Liang, a professor at Middlebury Institute of International Studies, where she specialises in international trade and Chinese foreign economic policy, among other topics.\n\nSome scholars, she said, had likened the last few months as worse than the peak of the Cold War between the US and the former Soviet Union, where leaders of the two countries at least had a hotline in place.\n\nThe call was days after Trump extended, for the fourth time, a deadline for China\u2019s ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or face a ban in the US under a law passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support and one that was later upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cIt will be a very complicated transaction, if it happens,\u201d said Robert Rogowsky, adjunct professor of trade and economic diplomacy at Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service, both because Beijing is reluctant to exit the app and because of the lack of clarity of future owners and rules around that.\n\n\u201cThe value of TikTok is the algorithm which selects for us what we want to see, but in a way that is remarkably controlling,\u201d said Rogowsky.\n\nWhile the focus in debates on TikTok\u2019s ownership has centred around data security, the real problem, instead, is its \u201cability to influence\u201d viewers through the algorithm, said Rogowsky.\n\n\u201cThink about the power that would confer on the owners, the power of that incredibly sophisticated algorithm that drives people\u2019s viewing, when that is under the control of a political party or groups [aligned with one], gives them tremendous power to influence.\u201d\n\nMiddlebury\u2019s Liang adds that it is unlikely that China would let go of the algorithm and expects \u201ca graceful exit\u201d that would allow both the US and China to get what they want from this deal.\n\nChina\u2019s \u2018stronger, bolder stand\u2019\n\nAny hammering out of a bigger trade deal on the multiple other issues, including US access to rare earth metals and China\u2019s purchase of Russian oil and access to US semiconductor chips, will have to wait for the two leaders to meet, experts say.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that Trump himself is not in a space to impose new tariffs on China, and that is a reflection of the fact that the US government has mixed interests with respect to China, and the Chinese control some very important choke points,\u201d said Ziemba, referring to China\u2019s hold over critical minerals.\n\nRogowsky agrees that \u201cChina is taking a much stronger, bolder stand with regard to the US, partly because that\u2019s the China way.\u201d\n\nBut it is also likely that Beijing has some justification for that confidence, he said, referring to Beijing\u2019s directive to businesses to avoid buying chips from US chip giant Nvidia.\n\n\u201cWhile US is trying to control what sort of chips go to China, they have declined to buy those, probably because they have the technology to design equally good or better and cheaper chips,\u201d he said. Plus, with US dependence on Chinese rare earth metals, Beijing is \u201cfeeling strong enough to confront the US\u201d."

From 2025 onward, no productive land can be converted into commercial facilities.\u201d\n\nFamous for its lush, green rice paddies and stunning beaches, the \u201cisland of the Gods\u201d has undergone rapid change over the past half-century with locals and tourists complaining about the traffic, pollution and badly behaved foreigners that have come with the hotels and resorts that now swamp the island.\n\nIndonesia said last year that it would place a moratorium on new hotels amid fears of overdevelopment, but the plan failed to eventuate. The new bylaws are expected to be brought into effect by the end of 2025.\n\nThe move follows a warning from Indonesia\u2019s meteorology and climate agency about the potential for an extreme rainy season this year, and a worsening waste crisis that has aggravated flooding in several regions, including Bali.\n\nFlooding is common in Indonesia during the wet season, which typically runs from September to March.\n\nHowever, scientists say the climate crisis is intensifying the rainy season, bringing heavier rainfall and more frequent flash floods. Overdevelopment and widespread deforestation are believed to be worsening the impact of flooding.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s environmental minister, Hanif Faisal Nurofiq, said after the floods that the new bylaws were an important step for the island.\n\n\u201cThis is also crucial for Bali\u2019s tourism as the recent flooding has drawn serious attention,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI actually told the governor last week that I really hope he will immediately stop the land conversions in Bali. This is extremely important.\u201d\n\nExtreme rainfall is more common and more intense because of human-caused climate breakdown across most of the world, particularly in Europe, most of Asia, central and eastern North America, and parts of South America, Africa and Australia.\n\nThis is because warmer air can hold more water vapour. Flooding has most likely become more frequent and severe in these locations as a result, but is also affected by human factors, such as the existence of flood defences and land use."

Mr Bru\u00f1a knows people who have lost up to 400 beehives in the fires.\n\nFortunately, his own 1,500 hives are intact, because the fire stopped just metres away from the fields where he keeps them. But the damage caused to nearby flora will have serious repercussions for his business.\n\n\"I calculate that this year I'm going to lose 50% of my honey production, at the very least, because of the fires, and the following year the same, or even worse,\" Mr Bru\u00f1a says. This is because of the time it will take for the flowers that bees need to grow back again in surrounding fields.\n\n\"There are some types of flower that won't appear again for three years,\" he explains.\n\nThe lack of structural damage to his hives means he cannot claim insurance. He is considering moving many of them elsewhere, in the hope of improving the bees' chances of survival and reducing his future losses.\n\nMany livestock farmers have also been forced to move their animals in recent weeks, both to avoid fires and to ensure they can access unburned pasture.\n\n\"Things couldn't have been worse for farmers [this summer], it was one fire after another,\" says Fernando Garc\u00eda, a cow farmer from Castromil, a village on the border between Castilla y Le\u00f3n and Galicia.\n\nHe spoke after spending hours working with local volunteers and firefighters to bring under control yet another blaze, on the edge of the village.\n\nMr Garc\u00eda has lost around 30 cattle this summer, most recently having to put down 11 animals which had suffered severe burns. At times, he has even kept his cows enclosed instead of letting them roam, because of fears about the fires.\n\n\"All of this has had a big economic impact, but the biggest impact of all is that we can't sleep at night,\" he says. \"It's a constant tension.\"\n\nAlthough farmers like Mr Garc\u00eda expect to receive insurance payments, he believes there will be a knock-on cost.\n\n\"They may pay us, but next year, instead of costing us, for example, \u20ac5,000 [$5,858; \u00a34,328], insurance premiums will cost \u20ac10,000 or \u20ac15,000,\" he says. \"Because insurance companies don't want to lose money.\"\n\nThe COAG national farmers' association estimated in August, when several large fires were still burning, that the industry had suffered damages worth at least \u20ac600m.\n\nThe biggest costs have been burned fields and properties and deaths of animals. However, there are other substantial damages, such as to beehives, and antennae used by farmers to locate their animals.\n\nFarmers' representatives are currently locked in negotiations with regional governments over how much public money should be paid out to help the sector recover.\n\nThe other main economic victim of this summer's fires has been tourism, which represents 13% of Spanish GDP and has been a motor of the country's strong recent growth.\n\nAlthough most of the coastal areas which are associated with tourism avoided fires this summer, the southern province of C\u00e1diz was an exception as hotels, holiday homes and camping sites were evacuated because of blazes.\n\nAnd this summer's main wildfire hotspots, in the west and north-west, have developed rural tourism in recent years as an alternative to the beach holidays for which Spain used to be known.\n\nHiking is popular here, for example along the Camino de Santiago trail or in the area's mountain ranges, as is wine and food related tourism.\n\nSanabria Lake, the largest glacial body of water in the Iberian peninsula, is a major local attraction, surrounded by a natural park. But the spread of the fire that began in Porto de Sanabria in mid-August caused it to be shut down. And many tourists left the area, as smoke filled the air in nearby towns.\n\n\"In August, this area was at full capacity in terms of tourism and people who have second homes here,\" says Miguel \u00c1ngel Martos, the mayor of Galende, which is a few minutes' drive from the lake.\n\n\"And then, on 18 August, it dropped down to 10% of capacity.\"\n\nFor tourists this was inconvenient. But for many locals it spelled financial disaster. Among them was \u00d3scar David Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez, who has a contract to hire two bar-restaurants on the shores of the lake.\n\nHe estimates that during the second half of August, when the local authorities closed down the lake, he lost \u20ac80,000, because of the rental of the bars, the wages and social security payments of his 14 employees, and the food which he had bought but which could not be sold.\n\n\"The regional government has said it will pay me \u20ac5,500,\" he says, laughing bitterly at the thought. \"They are going to have to come up with some other kind of compensation because I didn't want to close, they forced me to.\"\n\nThe Hosteltur, a news platform that reports on the tourism industry, warned that the damage caused by the wildfires in such areas \"is not limited to the material impact, but also the impact on the image\u2026 of these destinations\".\n\nThis summer has underlined the now-infamous schism between urban and rural Spain. Decades of migration from rural areas, such as those hardest hit by this summer's fires, to urban hubs means that 90% of the Spanish population now inhabits just 30% of its territory.\n\nThe rest has become known as la Espa\u00f1a vac\u00eda, or \"empty Spain\", where a sparse population has often complained about a lack of infrastructure, transport links, and schools, as well as the imposition of EU environmental and sanitary regulations for farmers.\n\nThe fires, which have been particularly uncontainable this year, only compound that discontent.\n\nIn Castromil, local man Miguel \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda Di\u00e9guez summed up the feelings of many people in rural areas who have watched the wildfires in horror this summer.\n\n\"It's hard enough as it is to survive because of the price of animal feed and fuel \u2013 every day it's more difficult for farmers to get by,\" he says. \"And then on top that, this happens.\""

They are angry, I\u2019m angry. We should all be angry, because what is happening is not right.\u201d\n\nCivil society and church organisations are among groups that have called for the joint demonstrations, which have parallels with outrage over alleged government corruption and privilege across the region.\n\nA gen Z-led protest movement toppled the government of Nepal this month, while a series of demonstrations also erupted in Indonesia, sparked by privileges afforded to lawmakers, which the government has since been forced to retract.\n\nThis week angry young people in East Timor also took to the streets to demand that a plan to give lawmakers free SUVs be revoked. In the face of the unrest, the government has now scrapped the plan.\n\nIn the Philippines, public anger has been intensifying over so-called ghost infrastructure projects after Marcos put them centre stage in a July state of the nation address that followed weeks of deadly flooding.\n\nMartin Romualdez, a cousin of President Marcos and the speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives, tendered his resignation on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe issues surrounding certain infrastructure projects have raised questions that weigh not only upon me but upon this institution we all serve,\u201d Romualdez said.\n\n\u201cThe longer I stay, the heavier that burden grows.\u201d\n\nIn a speech before the plenary, Romualdez said he had tendered his resignation with \u201ca full heart and a clear conscience\u201d.\n\n\u201cI do this so that the independent commission on infrastructure may pursue its mandate freely and fully \u2013 without doubt, without interference and without undue influence,\u201d he said, adding that he unequivocally supported calls for accountability.\n\nLast week, the owners of a construction firm accused nearly 30 House members and officials in the department of public works and highways of taking cash payments.\n\nMarcos on Monday announced former supreme court justice Andres Reyes would head a three-person commission tasked with looking into the past decade of flood-control projects."

It was in response to a bubbling discussion in Australia about whether a different major conservative party could emerge outside the established Liberal or National ones.\n\nReferencing Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform party in the UK, leading in polls over the traditional conservatives, Abbott said: \u201cI don\u2019t say that something like that should never, ever happen here in Australia. But what we need right now in Australia is not a reform party, but a reformed party. A reformed Liberal party.\u201d\n\nAudience members at several points interjected during Abbott\u2019s speech, yelling support for Pauline Hanson and One Nation. Hanson will speak at the conference on Sunday, while conservative politicians Alex Antic, Matt Canavan and former British prime minister Liz Truss were among Saturday\u2019s speakers.\n\nCoalition sources remained concerned about losing support on their left and right to more moderate \u201cteal\u201d or independent MPs as well as to more right-wing parties like One Nation. A recent Newspoll showed the Coalition\u2019s primary vote at its lowest-ever ebb, just 27%, while One Nation had risen to 10%.\n\nChanges to the Coalition were a common theme for speakers. Price asked attendees to help in \u201cshaping\u201d the Liberal party, which she said must be \u201csmarter\u201d and \u201csharper\u201d. She branded May\u2019s election defeat as \u201ca Coalition failure\u201d, having \u201clost our nerve to prosecute policies of difference from Labor\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need to return to being a strong centre-right party \u2013 in conviction, in policy, and in practice,\u201d she said.\n\nPrice again urged Liberal colleagues to dump the net zero by 2050 target agreed by former PM Scott Morrison. She branded the climate target \u201ccommunism\u201d, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s time the Liberals pushed back against this freedom-eroding nonsense.\u201d\n\nAbbott also urged Liberals to strongly oppose Labor\u2019s climate action, claiming this week\u2019s announcement of a 62-70% by 2035 reduction target \u201ccould be this government\u2019s political death warrant\u201d.\n\nThe opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said she doesn\u2019t support setting climate targets in opposition, but that the Coalition was still reviewing its net zero position, and remained committed it.\n\nWarren Mundine, the chair of Cpac who has run for Liberal pre-selection after serving as Labor party president, said conservative voters needed to cooperate to win future elections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a battle; we get the conservative side of politics back together, and this is the beginning of it. We need to bring all the conservative groups together. One thing in the lesson that we\u2019ve learned from the left is: how do we do preferences and support each other?\u201d he said.\n\nMundine asked Cpac attendees to listen to the \u201cbrave Liberal and National party people\u201d who would speak at the conference, saying \u201cthey\u2019re going to be our champions\u201d.\n\nDeputy Liberal leader Ted O\u2019Brien, who along with Ley was supported by the party\u2019s moderate wing to win a leadership ballot after Peter Dutton\u2019s election defeat, was heckled by some attendees during his address. As he called Albanese\u2019s government \u201cthe worst since Whitlam\u201d, several audience members loudly interjected with \u201cwhat are you going to do about it?\u201d and \u201cit starts with you\u201d.\n\nO\u2019Brien also admitted the need \u201cto rebuild the Liberal party\u201d.\n\nNationals senator Bridget McKenzie, the shadow transport minister, said the \u201ccentre-right of politics \u2026 has to stop fighting amongst ourselves\u201d.\n\n\u201cBecause how the enemy has done this to us; [they are] highly disciplined, very well-financed, and relentless, militant in their intent over time.

Two deaths occurred in South Australia and two in WA.\n\nRue said that WA police advised Optus that they believed the \u201cindividual likely attempted to contact triple zero for assistance\u201d, adding that the company would work with authorities to \u201cunderstand more of what has occurred\u201d.\n\nThe CEO earlier confirmed that two customers had called Optus during the outage on Thursday to warn the telco that triple zero calls were not working, but the complaints were not escalated.\n\nRue told reporters on Saturday afternoon: \u201cWe now know we were informed by two individuals that they could not connect into triple zero, and this information was not surfaced with the relevant escalation at that time.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarly review suggests that we had not handled these calls as would be expected,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, said triple zero calls were out of action for 10 hours \u2013 eight hours longer than Optus initially claimed \u2013 but Rue confirmed on Saturday afternoon the timeframe was more than 13 hours.\n\nThe CEO confirmed the planned technical upgrade began at 12.30am on Thursday but was cut short at 1.50pm after the telco was notified by SA police that there was an problem.\n\n\u201cOnce notified, we stopped the upgrade, restoring triple zero, and began to confirm with relevant stakeholders, such as police and other regulatory and government agencies and departments that we had experienced an outage impacting triple zero,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nRue said Optus commenced welfare checks, and during which it learned three people had died during the outage.\n\n\u201cOnce we had this information and were confident of its accuracy, we shared this with our board, with the ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority), the federal government and other bodies,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday, the federal government confirmed the ACMA would conduct an investigation.\n\nSA police, which had also worked through Friday night conducting welfare checks on 150 people whose triple zero calls failed, confirmed an eight-week-old boy from Gawler, on Adelaide\u2019s northern fringe, and a 68-year-old woman from Queenstown, a suburb in the city\u2019s north-west, had died during the outage.\n\nThe third death linked to the outage, which involved up to 600 attempted triple zero calls, was a 74-year-old Western Australian man, the state government confirmed on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking and it is completely unacceptable that people\u2019s lives have been put at risk, and of course, with deep sadness, I can confirm that one 74-year-old man has passed away,\u201d Labor minister John Carey said at a press conference.\n\n\u201cWA police are now making safety checks on the calls that did not get through, and they\u2019re working through that.\u201d\n\nMalinauskas said he was not informed about the outage until Optus had commenced a press conference announcing it to the public. He told reporters he had never witnessed \u201csuch incompetence\u201d from an Australian communications company.\n\nThe premier said that only after its press conference on Friday did Optus give SA police the details, including the names of the deceased.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to make sure they\u2019re letting our emergency services know \u2026 all the information the moment they have it, before they think about crafting a media statement,\u201d Malinauskas said.\n\n\u201cIt is somewhat extraordinary we had a situation (on Friday) after everything that had unfolded, that we were still struggling to get information from Optus to allow police to do their work.\u201d\n\nCarey echoed the premier\u2019s words on Saturday. \u201cIt is unbelievable, and the way that Optus has even just released the news, I think, is appalling.\u201d\n\nRue said on Saturday afternoon that he had asked his team to make a plan for establishing a formal notification process between the telco and authorities during such incidents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that the lack of this process led to the late notification of the premiers and chief ministers,\u201d he said, confirming they were contacted at the same time as Friday\u2019s press conference was held.\n\n\u201cOptus will be appointing an independent person to lead a review into this entire incident, from every aspect. I hope to confirm that person in coming days.\n\n\u201cThe loss of the lives of three people, two in South Australia and one in Western Australia, is absolutely tragic. I would again like to extend my deepest condolences to their families and friends.\u201d\n\nThe SA police commissioner, Grant Stevens, told the premier on Friday night that Optus had only supplied the suburbs where the deaths had occurred.\n\n\u201cI then called the CEO of Optus and thankfully, it was rectified following that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut the lack of information flow from Optus to the South Australian government\u2019s appropriate authorities is somewhat bewildering, and it raises a lot of questions.\u201d\n\nThe federal communications minister, Anika Wells, said the incident was \u201cincredibly serious and completely unacceptable\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe impact of this failure has had tragic consequences, and my personal thoughts are with those who have lost a loved one,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nIn a press conference on Saturday, Wells said Australians had \u201cevery right to be livid that Optus cannot get these basics right\u201d.\n\n\u201cOptus have let Australians down when they needed them most.\u201d\n\nAll telecommunications providers were obliged to ensure they carried emergency service calls, and the outage would be thoroughly investigated, Wells said, adding that the government would wait until state authorities and communications regulatory bodies had completed their investigations before considering possible consequences for Optus.\n\nThe federal opposition\u2019s communications spokesperson, Melissa McIntosh, expressed deep concern the triple zero camp-on arrangements to divert calls to other carriers like Telstra or Vodafone had also failed.\n\nThe outage occurred almost two years after more than 10 million Optus customers and businesses were disconnected for more than 16 hours in November 2023.\n\nPeople could not call triple zero on landlines, although it was still possible on a mobile.\n\nThe telco was fined more than $12m for breaching emergency call rules during the nationwide outage.\n\nRue took over as the company\u2019s chief executive in 2024 from Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, who resigned over the 2023 outage."

                "text": "Australia\u2019s big miners are not averse to a political fight.\n\nConsider the biggest miner of them all: BHP.\n\nIn 2010, it fought fiercely against the super profits tax and helped bring down a prime minister. In 2017, a state party leader who championed an increase in mine lease fees in Western Australia lost his seat after a campaign by BHP.\n\nAnd since 2022, the big miner has railed against Queensland\u2019s revamped royalty scheme, brought in by Labor and now supported by the Liberal National government.\n\nOn Wednesday, BHP escalated its campaign by blaming \u201cunsustainable\u201d royalties and market conditions for its decision with its joint venture partner, Mitsubishi, to suspend operations at its Saraji South coalmine in the Bowen Basin, and slash 750 roles across the state.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nThe big miner said it will also conduct a strategic review of the BHP FutureFit Academy in Mackay \u2013 an educational facility that trains new miners \u2013 because of the royalty scheme\u2019s \u201cunsustainable impact on our business returns\u201d.\n\nShortly after the announcement, two other miners operating in Queensland, Anglo American and QCoal, revealed job cuts.\n\nRoyalties alone don\u2019t explain the decisions.\n\nDig deeper\n\nThe BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) operates five coking coalmines in Queensland\u2019s Bowen Basin, most of which are open-cut operations. Coking coal, also known as metallurgical or met coal, differs from thermal coal used in heating \u2013 a business that BHP has been exiting.\n\nThere\u2019s some pretty obvious reasons coalmines across Queensland aren\u2019t as profitable as they used to be, most of which have nothing to do with the state\u2019s tiered royalty rates.\n\nProduction costs have been rising as miners dig deeper into the earth. This takes more fuel, and causes expensive wear and tear on equipment, to get at it.\n\nAt the same time, worker wages and associated labour costs have risen in a sector that regularly experiences skills shortages.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a cost problem \u2013 and royalties are one of those elements \u2013 but they\u2019re certainly not the main element,\u201d says Andrew Gorringe, energy financial analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve also been focused on getting volume at any cost. When the prices were good and they wanted to sell as much coal as they could, they expanded with little thought to costs.\u201d\n\nCoalminers recently emerged from a windfall period, marked by huge price rises after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Coking coal prices soared above $US600 a tonne in 2022, but have since normalised at under $US200.\n\nIn 2022, as prices were soaring, the then Labor government introduced three new royalty tiers to capture a greater share of wealth generated during commodity price spikes. The base rates, when prices are lower, remain the same.\n\nThe scheme agitates miners because it reduces, but in no way eliminates, the excesses they can earn during boom times, setting up an ideological clash between the resources sector and those who believe mineral wealth should be apportioned more evenly.\n\nGorringe says unit cash costs, which are a key profitability metric, for Queensland\u2019s coking coal producers have risen 50% since 2018.\n\nRoyalties actually represent a lower percentage of their cost base in 2025 than they did before the pandemic, according to his analysis.\n\nCoal \u2018tax\u2019\n\nThe ideological divide is evident in BHP\u2019s description of royalties as the Queensland government\u2019s \u201ccoal tax\u201d, a politically charged term designed to stir up support for the resources sector in the community.\n\nIn Australia, state governments own the minerals in the ground. Miners pay a royalty to access them; they are not a tax.\n\nIt would be the ultimate mark of a successful lobbying campaign if the resources sector convinces the general public miners should pay a lower rate for a publicly owned resource.\n\nThe idea that the state purse might receive a higher rate when prices surge is particularly sensitive for coalminers because they are in a sector that may not have many booms left.\n\n\u201cStructural decline in one of Australia\u2019s largest fossil fuel export commodities coupled with rising unit costs are the factors driving these investment and operating decisions, not Queensland\u2019s nation-leading royalty scheme,\u201d says Matt Pollard, an analyst at clean energy consultancy Climate Energy Finance.\n\nWhile the role of coking coal in steelmaking will eventually be supplanted by cleaner alternatives, BHP argues that it is \u201cconsidered indispensable for the foreseeable future\u201d.\n\nAfter commodity price booms subside, miners typically shed some jobs and re-focus on bringing down production costs, which is evident in the series of recent announcements from coalminers of workforce changes.\n\nSome projects may simply not be viable outside boom times.\n\nTo be sure, Queensland\u2019s royalty regime is a cost that miners must factor in to their anticipated workforce needs, but it is not the primary trigger for job cuts in a sector that appears to be in decline.\n\nBHP\u2019s decision to link the royalty scheme to its \u201cstrategic review\u201d of its Mackay training facility has a particular sting to it, given it looks like an ultimatum to bring the state government to the negotiating table.\n\nBHP has, once again, shown it\u2019s not averse to a political fight."

Last week he said the US was ready to \u201cdo major sanctions\u201d \u2013 but only after all Nato countries agreed to stop buying oil from Russia, and to put tariffs on China, another big importer.\n\nSpeaking to a group of journalists in Kyiv, including the Guardian, Zelenskyy expressed frustration at the pace of events. He said to \u201ctie up\u201d possible US sanctions with demands on European countries to move first was to \u201cslow down the pressure on Putin\u201d.\n\nSpeaking in his presidential office, Zelenskyy said:\n\nPresident Trump expects strong action from Europe. I think we are wasting a lot of time if sanctions are not imposed or some steps are not taken, that we very much expect from him [Trump].\n\nTrump\u2019s close allies Hungary and Slovakia have refused to cut energy ties with Moscow. They are the last two EU members still buying Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline. Ukraine bombed it last month, prompting an angry response from Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\n\nZelenskyy said he wanted the \u201cwhole of Europe\u201d to impose sanctions. He said Trump could \u201cpush\u201d European countries to do more and added that Slovakia\u2019s pro-Russian government was likely to respond to American pressure. \u201cEveryone is looking to the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nHe reiterated his willingness to meet Putin in any format \u2013 either one to one, or \u201ctrilaterally\u201d, with the US president in the room. The Kremlin says the \u201croot causes\u201d of the conflict have to be addressed before this can happen, referring to Ukraine\u2019s capitulation.\n\nShare\n\nUK chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce plans to explore using frozen Russian assets to fund a \u201creparations loan\u201d that could provide billions of pounds for Ukraine\u2019s war effort, reports the PA news agency.\n\nThe chancellor is expected to make the announcement at a meeting with her European counterparts in Copenhagen on Saturday, saying it is \u201cright to explore all options to support Ukraine\u201d.\n\nIt comes after European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen last week suggested providing a loan to Ukraine backed by the \u201ccash balances\u201d associated with Russian assets frozen by the EU. She did not provide details of how it would work, but the move would allow the EU to use Russian assets to fund Ukraine without immediately confiscating them, which several countries fear would breach international law.\n\nAccording to the PA news agency, Treasury officials also declined to discuss the mechanisms the UK would consider, but said they would be developed alongside the EU and comply with international law.\n\nReeves said:\n\nWhile Russia has no respect for international law, the UK does.\n\nWe will only consider options in line with international law and that are economically and financially responsible.\n\nIn March, the UK announced it would provide a \u00a32.26bn loan to Ukraine based on profits generated by frozen Russian assets. But the government has been urged to go further, with the Liberal Democrats calling for ministers to seize the assets outright and use them to support Ukraine.\n\nThe Treasury said a \u201creparations loan\u201d could see billions of pounds made available for Ukraine without touching the underlying assets. Reeves said:\n\nThis is Russia\u2019s war, and Russia should pay. It is right to explore all options to support Ukraine.\n\nDefending against Russian aggression is vital not just to the long-term security and prosperity of Ukraine, but to the UK and the whole of Europe.\n\nSince the outbreak of war, the UK has committed up to \u00a321.8bn for Ukraine, just less than the \u00a325bn of Russian assets the government has frozen, reports the PA news agency.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 07.23 EDT\n\nUkrainian drone attack on Russia kills four people, says governor\n\nA Ukrainian drone attack on Russia\u2019s south-western Samara region killed four people, the local governor said on Saturday as Kyiv said Ukraine had been targeted with hundreds of Russian drones overnight.\n\n\u201cIt is with deep sorrow that I report that four people were killed in an enemy drone attack last night,\u201d governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev said on social media, adding that one person was injured.\n\nShare\n\nAfternoon summary\n\nHere is a recap of the events from today so far:\n\nPolish and allied aircraft were deployed early on Saturday to ensure the safety of Polish airspace after Russia launched airstrikes targeting western Ukraine near the border with Poland, armed forces of the Nato-member country said. \u201cPolish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, while ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems have been brought to the highest state of readiness,\u201d the operational command said in a post on X.\n\nRussia fired 40 missiles and about 580 drones at Ukraine in a \u201cmassive attack\u201d that killed three and wounded dozens, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday. \u201cEvery such strike is not a military necessity but a deliberate strategy by Russia to terrorise civilians and destroy our infrastructure,\u201d Zelenskyy said on social media, urging Kyiv\u2019s allies to provide more air defence systems and hit Moscow with extra sanctions.\n\nSergiy Lysak, the head of the Ukrainian military administration in the Dnipropetrovsk region, said Russia\u2019s latest strikes killed one person and wounded 26, with one man in a serious condition. Vyacheslav Chaus from the regional administration in Chernigiv in northern Ukraine said a 62-year-old man died in a drone attack. About 20 residential buildings were damaged in the Khmelnytskyi region, local official Sergiy Tyurin said on Telegram, adding that one body was found \u201cduring the extinguishing of a fire in one of the houses.\u201d\n\nA cyber-attack at a service provider for check-in and boarding systems has disrupted operations at several major European airports including London\u2019s Heathrow, Brussels and Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg, causing flight delays and cancellations on Saturday. Collins Aerospace owner RTX said on Saturday that it had become aware of a cyber-related disruption to its MUSE software in selected airports, adding that it was \u201cactively working to resolve the issue and restore full functionality to our customers as quickly as possible\u201d.\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he would meet his US counterpart Donald Trump on the sidelines of the UN general assembly next week in comments released on Saturday. Zelenskyy said he would hold \u201ca meeting with the president of the United States\u201d, adding he would discuss security guarantees for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia during the talks with Trump.\n\nThree Russian MiG-31 fighters violated Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland on Friday, Estonia said, triggering complaints of a dangerous new provocation from the EU and Nato. Italian F-35 fighters attached to Nato\u2019s air defence support mission in the Baltic states were scrambled to intercept the Russian jets and warn them off, Estonian and Italian officials said, with alliance chief Mark Rutte praising the \u201cquick and decisive response\u201d.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry on Friday denied that three of its MiG-31 fighter jets had illegally entered Estonian airspace. The ministry said the jets were on a \u201cscheduled flight... in strict compliance with international airspace regulations and did not violate the borders of other states, as confirmed by objective monitoring\u201d.\n\nZelenskyy on Friday condemned the move, calling the 12-minute incursion \u201coutrageous\u201d and accusing Moscow of deliberately expanding its \u201cdestabilising activity\u201d three and a half years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \u201cThese are not accidents. This is a systematic Russian campaign directed against Europe, against Nato, against the West. And it requires a systemic response,\u201d Zelenskyy posted on X.\n\nOne or more large fires erupted early on Saturday at Russia\u2019s Saratov oil refinery as it was hit heavily by Ukrainian drones that attacked the target deep inside Russian territory for at least the second time in a week. Videos vetted and posted by online analysts showed incoming UAVs followed by big explosions and flames rising from the site while air raid sirens blared. The major refinery is nearly 600km (370 miles) east of the frontline in Ukraine. The Russian governor in the area, Roman Busargin, confirmed an attack by UAVs.\n\nShare\n\nBritish transport minister Heidi Alexander said on Saturday that she was getting regular updates on an earlier incident affecting airline check-in and boarding which was impacting flights at Heathrow and other European airports.\n\nShe said in a post on X:\n\nI\u2018m aware of an incident affecting airline check-in and boarding, impacting flights at Heathrow and other European airports\n\nI\u2019m getting regular updates, and monitoring the situation. If you\u2019re flying at Heathrow today, check with your airline before travelling.\n\nBrussels airport said earlier that a cyber-attack was having a \u201clarge impact\u201d on flight schedules, with similar problems being flagged at Berlin\u2019s Brandenburg airport and Heathrow in London, Europe\u2019s busiest.\n\nAccording to the BBC, aviation watchdog Eurocontrol said airlines had been asked to cancel half their flights to and from Brussels airport between 4.00am British time on Saturday and 2.00am British time on Sunday because of the incident.\n\nBerlin airport said on its website that there were longer waiting times at check-in and it was working on a quick solution.\n\nDelta Air Lines said it anticipated minimal impact to flights departing from the three affected airports, according to Reuters.\n\nIt added that the airline had implemented a workaround to minimise any disruption.\n\nShare\n\nRuth Michaelson\n\nRuth Michaelson is a journalist based in Istanbul\n\nThe outgoing head of MI6 has issued a damning indictment of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, saying that Vladimir Putin has \u201cbitten off more than he can chew\u201d.\n\nRichard Moore, known within MI6 as C, used his farewell speech in Istanbul to say that while Russia was unlikely to win on the battlefield, his agency was seeking to recruit spies inside Russia and worldwide in order to fight back.\n\n\u201cPutin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable, but he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,\u201d said Moore. \u201cBut we should not believe him. Or credit him with strength he does not have.\u201d\n\nAny Russian victories on the battlefield remained incremental, said Moore, and incurred massive costs as the president\u2019s army fell far short of its original aims to swiftly capture all of Ukraine.\n\nThe rising costs now included more than a million casualties \u2013 a quarter of them \u201cpoorly trained troops from Russia\u2019s poorest regions\u201d that were \u201cfed into the meat grinder\u201d, he said.\n\nYou can read more of Ruth Michaelson\u2019s report here: Outgoing MI6 chief says Putin has \u2018bitten off more than he can chew\u2019 in Ukraine\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 06.07 EDT"

This incident highlights escalating tensions in the region, with NATO officials expressing the need for a united response to Russian provocations, as concerns grow over the implications for collective defense under NATO's Article 5.",

                "text": "Estonia has requested a consultation with other Nato members after Russian warplanes violated its airspace on Friday morning.\n\nThree Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered the Estonian skies \"without permission and remained there for a total of 12 minutes\" over the Gulf of Finland, the government said.\n\nItaly, Finland and Sweden scrambled jets under Nato's mission to bolster its eastern flank. A Nato spokesperson said it was \"yet another example of reckless Russian behaviour and Nato's ability to respond\".\n\nRussia denied violating Estonian airspace. But tensions have been escalating recently, after Poland and Romania - both Nato members - said Russian drones breached their airspace.\n\nArticle 4 of the Nato treaty formally starts urgent consultations within the 32-member alliance, which ties the US and many European nations together on collective defence.\n\nIt is the second time this month that a Nato member has requested Article 4 consultations. Poland did so on 10 September after Russian drones entered its airspace.\n\nEstonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal said \"Nato's response to any provocation must be united and strong\".\n\n\"We consider it essential to consult with our allies to ensure shared situational awareness and to agree on our next joint steps,\" Michal said.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said on Friday: \"I don't love it. I don't like when that happens. Could be big trouble.\"\n\nEstonia, which shares a border with Russia to the east, says this was the fifth Russian violation of its airspace this year.\n\nOfficials said the Russian aircraft entered its airspace from the north-east and were intercepted by Finnish jets over the Gulf of Finland. Once inside Estonian airspace, Italian F-35 jets, based in Estonia, were deployed under Nato's Baltic Air Policing mission to escort the aircraft out.\n\nThe government said the Russian jets had no flight plans, had their transponders turned off and also did not have two-way radio communication with Estonian air traffic control.\n\nRussia's defence ministry said the jets were on a \"scheduled flight... in strict compliance with international airspace regulations and did not violate the borders of other states, as confirmed by objective monitoring\".\n\nIt said they flew over neutral Baltic waters, more than 3km (two miles) from Vaindloo Island, which belongs to Estonia.\n\nFriday's incursion was not an isolated incident, even if it was considered the most serious violation of Estonian airspace so far.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC on Saturday morning, Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said it was part of a pattern of Russian behaviour.\n\nHe used the analogy of the boiling frog to explain Russia's strategy. The suggestion is that by very gradually ramping up provocations, none of which on their own would necessitate a military response, Russia is able to test and ultimately undermine Nato's defences.\n\nThat is why there are calls, including from former UK Defence Secretary Sir Ben Wallace, for the alliance to take a much tougher line with the Kremlin.\n\nHe argued Russia needed to be presented with a \"strategic dilemma\" - a response that would demonstrate its provocations came with a cost.\n\nThe question is, what would that be? In 2015, a much briefer violation of airspace over Turkey - another Nato member - ended with the shooting down of a Russian jet and the eventual death of the pilot.\n\nThat resulted in diplomatic and economic consequences, but not all-out war. And no similar incursion has been reported since.\n\nWould the same be true if the MiGs had been shot down this time? It's impossible to say with any certainty.\n\nOne vital added complication would be the response of Donald Trump.\n\nAs ever with this president, it is a fool's game to make firm predictions - but it is very possible he would view the shooting down of Russian planes, even in Nato airspace, as a significant and unnecessary escalation - and one he would oppose.\n\nWere a wider conflict to result, it is entirely conceivable he would view Europe as being significantly responsible and so may refuse to offer vital US support.\n\nThat would have repercussions beyond a single incident \u2013 calling into question Nato's much vaunted Article 5, which says that an armed attack against one or more members will be considered an attack against all.\n\nThat would be a nightmare scenario for Europe - and a dream one for the Kremlin. All in all, it has created an environment of extreme strategic uncertainly for European powers, one they are still trying to decide how to respond to."

                "text": "When it comes to film-making, Norway has long been left watching on while its Nordic neighbours Sweden and Denmark put out hit after hit by luminaries such as Lars von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg and Ruben \u00d6stlund.\n\nBut after years in the shadows, the country has finally found its place in the international spotlight with a number of distinctive, relationship-centred and critically acclaimed films and television shows in what many are describing as a Norwegian \u201cgolden age\u201d.\n\nThe last few months alone have seen the release of Dreams, the third of Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Oslo Stories Trilogy, which won the biggest prize at this year\u2019s Berlin film festival; Joachim Trier\u2019s Sentimental Value, which was awarded the Grand Prix at Cannes and comes off the back of his Oscar-nominated The Worst Person in the World; Lilja Ingolfsdottir\u2019s Loveable; and Armand, the directorial debut feature from Halfdan Ullmann T\u00f8ndel.\n\nMeanwhile, Pernille (known as P\u00f8rni in Norway) has found dedicated audiences around the world since the Viaplay comedy drama series about the life of a single-parent family was recommissioned by Netflix.\n\n\u201cWe are in a golden age of Norwegian cinema,\u201d Ullmann T\u00f8ndel, who is working on the script for his next film, told the Guardian. \u201cEspecially in terms of recognition from the biggest festivals and how Norwegian cinema films are being perceived outside of Norway.\u201d\n\nAlthough there has been no shortage of talented Norwegian film-makers \u2013 including Trier and Haugerud \u2013 on the whole, Ullmann T\u00f8ndel said, films coming out of Norway had generally been \u201cquite safe\u201d. This was not the case, he said, among the younger generation, many of whom have formed a collective to encourage and inspire one another to take risks and have fun. Others to break through recently with their directorial debuts include Emilie Blichfeldt, with The Ugly Stepsister, and Thea Hvistendal, with Handling the Undead.\n\n\u201cWhat is so great is that all of us have a very different visuality. That\u2019s a really important thing in Norwegian cinema,\u201d said Ullmann T\u00f8ndel. \u201cBecause in Sweden for example, everybody tried to make Ruben \u00d6stlund films for a while and in Denmark everyone tried to make Lars von Trier films for a while. So we really try to nurture our own singularity.\u201d\n\nIf there is a face of this new wave, then it is almost certainly the unvarnished expressions of Renate Reinsve, who can be found collapsing into seven minutes of laughter in Armand and finding her way through the micro-details of romantic relationships in all their joy, pain, awkwardness and humour as she did in the 2021 hit The Worst Person in the World.\n\n\u201cShe is so intuitive and smart, and goes very deep into her roles, but she does it with a lightness,\u201d said Ullmann T\u00f8ndel, adding that she is also very funny. \u201cShe has a remarkable understanding, it seems, of what makes us human.\u201d\n\nNorway\u2019s newfound international stature in the film world has not gone unnoticed by its neighbours.\n\n\u201cIt hurts to admit it because of our countries\u2019 eternal rivalry, but Norway is light years ahead of Sweden in terms of cultivating original cinematic voices,\u201d said Kristoffer Viita, an author and film critic for the Swedish broadcaster SVT.\n\nWhile Viita takes some consolation from the fact that Ullman T\u00f8ndel\u2019s grandfather \u2013 the legendary director Ingmar Bergman \u2013 was Swedish, he is not sure that the young Norwegian director would have been able to follow his same path in Sweden, where the film industry is focused mainly on Swedish audiences.\n\nHenriette Steenstrup, who wrote and starred in Pernille, said that as a Norwegian she had not expected her series to be an international success \u2013 because of the specifically Norwegian society it showed. Unlike Nordic noir\u2019s focus on crime and detectives, her series focused on everyday subjects such as family and loss. \u201cThere is a lot of drama in everyday life,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile it is easier to make films in Norway than in many other countries, with consistent state funding and a steady flow of talent emerging from free-of-charge film schools, film-makers are coming up against growing difficulties in getting their projects financed.\n\n\u201cNorway is a big hub of talent,\u201d said Hege Hauff Hvattum, one of the producers of the Oslo Stories Trilogy. \u201cThe money from the Norwegian Film Institute (NFI) has been good in the sense that many projects have been realised with a mix of Nordic funding alone, but it\u2019s not been increased at the same speed as the costs, so we\u2019re starting to wonder how it will be in the future. Especially since the streamers are not doing as much drama and films and TV series as they did, that\u2019s an issue.\u201d\n\nThere was also the problem of streamers seeking to make films more appealing to wider audiences, which Hauff Hvattum said could result in making them generic. \u201cIf you want to tell a story that is honest and precise, I believe that is easier if you write out of a local perspective to capture the nuances \u2013 it\u2019s more interesting,\u201d she said.\n\nKjersti Mo, the CEO of the NFI, said Norway\u2019s success was the product of long-term state investment in film-making \u2013 about 670m NOK (\u00a350m) this year \u2013 and the professionalisation of its film industry in terms of working with international partners.\n\nThe NFI tries to help independent film-makers in the way it structures their financing, by making it dependent on theatrical release and owning their own rights. \u201cWe have to empower our creatives and producers so that they still have a choice,\u201d said Mo. \u201cIn the ecosystem the money from the streamers still matters but we will not let them design everything.\u201d The NFI\u2019s job, she said, was to \u201cempower the art side\u201d of film-making.\n\nContrary to an overall move towards dumbing down, Mo said that increasingly, films selected by the institute for their artistic merits were also the ones that were popular among audiences. \u201cThat makes me really happy. We are building awareness in the Norwegian population so they are proud of the films and proud of the film-makers.\u201d\n\nNorway, she said, had always been \u201cthe little brother or sister\u201d to Denmark and Sweden when it came to film. \u201cThey are mostly happy for us,\u201d Mo said. \u201cI think it is also an inspiration.\u201d\n\nBut Sarah Iben Almbjerg, the film editor at the Danish newspaper Berlingske, said it would not be long before Danish film was \u201cback in the international limelight\u201d. She added: \u201cUntil then, the Norwegians can enjoy their place in the sun.\u201d"

He's performing traditional Uzbek melodies to a modern beat and playing a doira, the ancient drum of Central Asia.\n\nUzbekistan is among 23 countries competing at the Intervision Song Contest.\n\nIt's Russia's answer to Eurovision. With less kitsch \u2013 and more Kremlin.\n\nIntervision 2025 is Vladimir Putin's brainchild. He signed a decree reviving the Soviet-era songfest with the aim of \"developing international cultural and humanitarian co-operation\".\n\nThe more obvious objective is creating an international song contest in which Moscow can actually take part. In 2022 Russia was banned from competing in Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA pattern's emerging.\n\nWhen Team Russia was banned from the Olympic Games, Moscow tried to create alternatives, like the Games of the Future and the World Friendship Games.\n\nNow the Kremlin's come up with its own version of Eurovision.\n\nBut what does it look like and who is taking part?\n\nFor Intervision, the Russians have cast their musical net far and wide, inviting allies from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. The starting line-up reflects the political and economic alliances of which Russia is part, like the Brics group of nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Commonwealth of Independent States.\n\nThe list of participating countries includes China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Vietnam, Venezuela, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Madagascar: a very different musical map from Eurovision, and an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that, despite its invasion of Ukraine, Russia still has friends.\n\nThe United States, too, is taking part: a sign of the thaw in US-Russian relations since Donald Trump's return to the White House.\n\nThaw doesn't mean problem-free. America's original Intervision entrant Brandon Howard pulled out on the eve of the contest.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I had some... family issues that happened here domestically, that I wasn't [going] to be able to go abroad and do that,\" the singer, who performs as B.Howard, tells me on a call from the US.\n\n\"However, I really believe that it's such a wonderful event.\"\n\n\"Were there some people who said to you 'Brandon, you shouldn't go, because of the war?'\" I asked.\n\n\"Some fans would mention some things like that and expressed slight concern. However, for the most part, everyone was very supportive of me going there, being sent to be a beacon of light.\"\n\nB.Howard has been replaced by Australian-Greek singer Vassy who lives in Los Angeles.\n\n\"4.3 billion people live in the 23 participating countries,\" boasted senior Kremlin official Sergei Kiriyenko. \"That's more than half the world's population.\"\n\nMr Kiriyenko, President Putin's deputy chief of staff, chairs the song contest's supervisory board. He made a brief appearance this week at an Intervision press conference alongside Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko.\n\n\"I know some people think there's an element of politics in Eurovision,\" I tell Mr Lavrov. \"But look who's represented here: the Kremlin, the foreign ministry and the Russian government. Isn't that proof that Intervision is a purely political or geopolitical project?\"\n\n\"If the governments of some countries make no effort to create mechanisms for supporting culture, that's their choice,\" Mr Lavrov replies. \"In our country the state is engaged in the promotion of the arts. Your question is rooted in the fear of competition.\"\n\nIn Ukraine they fear something quite different: that Moscow is using Intervision to divert global attention from the war.\n\n\"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine considers that the Intervision 2025 song contest organised by Russia is an instrument of hostile propaganda and a means of whitewashing the aggressive policy of the Russian Federation,\" the ministry stated back in May.\n\nThe war is on some people's minds at Intervision.\n\n\"The scary thing is with the war, with whatever's happening. These are the things we were thinking about,\" says Renee Kruger from South African group Mzansi Jikelele.\n\n\"But we were assured: 'Just come, guys, nothing's wrong'. Obviously, we are [nervous], but we're here and we've been treated very well.\"\n\nRepresenting Russia at Intervision 2025 is Yaroslav Dronov, better known by his stage name Shaman. Last year the European Union sanctioned him for \"supporting actions and policies that undermine the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.\"\n\nHis previous hits include I'm Russian, a patriotic pop song that declares:\n\n\"I'm Russian, I go to the end\u2026 I'm Russian, to spite the whole world.\"\n\nNot exactly Love Shine A Light or Save Your Kisses for Me.\n\nBut Russia is using Intervision to project a softer image than the one forged by three-and-a-half years of its war in Ukraine.\n\nAt the official song contest draw to decide the running order, international delegations are being treated to a Russian feast, including cottage cheese pancakes and gingerbread sporting the Intervision logo. As folk dancers put on a spectacular show, volunteers hand out giant necklaces of bread rings, a symbol of Russian hospitality.\n\nOne by one the participants approach a gigantic samovar, select a tea cup and fill it with hot water. The magic mugs reveal the performance slot number for each country.\n\nFrom the folk costumes to the blinis, the emphasis here is on tradition.\n\nIt's the same with the songs. The official goal of the contest is to \"get to know the unique cultural traditions and achievements of participating countries [and] promote universal, spiritual, family, cultural, ethical and religious traditions of different nations.\"\n\nThe international performers have read the rulebook.\n\n\"My song tells about culture from Vietnam,\" Vietnamese entrant Duc Phuc informs me. \"I need to share the culture of Vietnam with everyone.\"\n\n\"How were you chosen to represent your country?\" I ask.\n\n\"The Ministry of Culture chose me.\"\n\n\"Our song is about a woman called Maria,\" says Brazilian entrant Tais Nader. \"Maria is like any Brazilian woman. She works hard to live. But she's always smiling and her eyes are shining.\"\n\n\"Have you heard of Eurovision?\" I ask.\n\n\"Actually, we searched online about Intervision and discovered Eurovision! Before, we didn't know about Intervision or Eurovision. It's new for us.\"\n\nFor many Russians, too, Intervision is something new. In fact it is a ghost from communist times summoned from the grave of song contests past.\n\nThe original Intervision Song Contest was born behind the Iron Curtain at a time when East and West competed in everything. In the Cold War there was a space race, an arms race and culture wars, too.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s Eurovision quickly established itself as a big deal in Western Europe, while in the Eastern bloc song festivals in Czechoslovakia and Poland acquired the occasional tag of 'Intervision'.\n\nThere was, though, some crossover. Finland took part in both Eurovision and Intervision, and big names from the West made guest appearances in the East. Gloria Gaynor, Petula Clarke and Boney-M all performed at Intervision.\n\nAfter the fall of communism Russia and Eastern Europe embraced the political changes sweeping the continent and were eager to compete in Eurovision. I saw that first hand in 1996 when, by a quirk of fate, I co-presented Russian TV's Song for Europe competition to select a Eurovision entry.\n\nDuring a guided tour of Russian TV, I'd got chatting to the show's director. When I told him I was a huge Eurovision fan he'd asked me to come back that evening to help anchor the programme. I'll never forget how excited everyone in the studio was that night: not only about Eurovision, but about Russia being part of the European family.\n\nBut will people watch it? Will the Intervision singers and songs capture the public's imagination across so many continents? The considerable time differences between the participating countries will likely preclude the kind of shared viewing experience you get with Eurovision.\n\nAnd there'll be no public vote. Just a jury: one member per country. But how will the voting take place?\n\n\"The voting system is specially invented by a very famous scientist and mathematician,\" Russian TV's Intervision commentator Yana Churikova tells me. \"Specially for Intervision.\"\n\nBack in the rehearsal room, Uzbekistan's entrant Shohruhmirzo Ganiev admits he doesn't know the intricacies of the voting system. He's just excited to be here. So is his mother. She's looking on proudly as her son rehearses.\n\nEven though his country isn't in Eurovision, Shohruhmirzo tells me that contest is famous in Uzbekistan. Right now, though, he's focused on his performance here.\n\n\"I'm very happy to come to Intervision,\" he tells me. \"I'm leaving Eurovision in the past.\""

                "text": "A Swiss theatre director known for re-enacting landmark trials has been told by a judge in Vienna that his publisher must withdraw a book in which he alleged that a far-right Austrian politician sang a song mocking the victims of the Holocaust.\n\nOn Thursday, Vienna\u2019s regional court fined independent German publishing house Verbrecher Verlag \u20ac1,500 (\u00a31,300) for publishing a book in which Milo Rau alleged that Heinz-Christian Strache, the former leader of the Freedom party (FP\u00d6), once sang a song with the line: \u201cWe\u2019ll manage the seventh million\u201d, a reference to the approximately 6 million European Jews murdered at the hands of the Nazi regime.\n\nRau, who this summer made global headlines with a verbatim staging of the Gis\u00e8lePelicot trial, conceded that the statement was \u201ca factual error\u201d. But he alleged that the defamation suit against his publisher fit into a broader pattern of nationalist parties using legal means to intimidate critical voices in the arts.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is far-right parties using the arsenal provided by democracy in order to destroy it,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n\nStrache, who served as Austria\u2019s vice-chancellor between 2017 and 2019 but resigned over the so-called Ibiza affair corruption scandal, has announced his intention to pursue a further defamation claim against Rau personally, for repeating the allegation in an interview with the Austrian playwright Elfriede Jelinek.\n\nRau, meanwhile, said he intends to make his experience the theme of a new theatrical production at Hamburg\u2019s Thalia theatre next February.\n\nThe defamatory passage was part of a speech Rau made in Berlin in March, in which he spoke about the way the FP\u00d6 has agitated against \u201cwoke events\u201d such as Eurovision and the Vienna festival, which Rau has been the artistic director of since 2023.\n\nThe speech was reprinted in a collection of Rau\u2019s writing called Resistance Has No Form, Resistance Is the Form, which was published in May and withdrawn from sale last week, ahead of the trial.\n\nIt says: \u201cWhat can we learn from a period \u2013 our period \u2013 in which a member of the biggest Austrian party, the FP\u00d6, a man called H-C Strache, sings the song \u2018We\u2019ll manage the seventh million\u2019 in the morning and in the afternoon goes on to visit the Yad Vashem remembrance centre, where the dead of the Holocaust are commemorated?\u201d\n\nThe mention of the song is a reference to a 2018 scandal where an FP\u00d6 politician was found to have been a member of a fraternity or Burschenschaft whose songbook made light of the Holocaust and glorified the Wehrmacht.\n\nOne of these drinking songs contained the line \u201cStep on the gas, you ancient Germanic peoples, we\u2019ll manage the seventh million\u201d. Dating back to the 19th century, the song was sung in the 1930s by liberal fraternities to make fun of the SS but was then adapted by neo-Nazi groups after the war, when the line mocking the Holocaust was added.\n\nRau said that while the specific allegation against Strache was incorrect, he still stood by the broader criticism it was trying to make: that the FP\u00d6, which was founded by former members of the Nazi party, was now pretending to act as protectors of Jewish interests.\n\nAs leader of the FP\u00d6, Strache made several visits to Israel and caused a scandal in 2010 when he visited Yad Vashem wearing not a kippa but the traditional cap of a student fraternity.\n\n\u201cStrache\u2019s visit to Yad Vashem wearing the headgear of a German nationalist fraternity was more brazen than anything alleged in my book,\u201d said Rau.\n\nWhile German-language student fraternities can range from far-right national socialists to liberal societies, Austrian fraternities have historically been located on a more narrowly nationalistic spectrum, and more vocal about their commitment to the idea of a \u201cGreater Germany\u201d based on ethnicity, precisely because they were located outside German borders."

Despite his imprisonment, Khalid remains resilient, continuing to advocate for peace and justice while maintaining hope amidst challenging conditions in Tihar jail.",
                "source": "Guardian",
                "text": "\u201cThere is indeed something about captivity that makes one feel like a state of somewhere between life and death,\u201d wrote Umar Khalid in June in a letter penned as his fifth year languishing behind bars approached.\n\nFew understand the purgatory of jail like Khalid. For five years \u2013 since his arrest in September 2020 under a draconian terrorism law \u2013 he has remained India\u2019s most prominent political prisoner, to many a potent symbol of the systematic crushing of dissent under the dominant Hindu nationalist regime of the prime minister, Narendra Modi.\n\nThis month the Delhi high court became the latest to deny the bail pleas of Khalid and his alleged co-conspirators. His bail case is now with the supreme court, where a hearing was delayed again on Friday. In the meantime he has remained detained in Delhi\u2019s notorious Tihar jail without a conviction to his name.\n\nKhalid, a Muslim and leftwing activist, is accused of being a key conspirator in the Delhi riots in which violent religious mobs rampaged across the north-west of the city in February 2020. Most of the 53 people killed in the riots were Muslims and several mosques were burned to the ground.\n\nBefore his arrest Khalid had emerged as one of the faces of an anti-government protest movement after the Modi government passed a citizenship law in late 2019 that was seen as discriminatory to Muslims. The protests that erupted were the first widespread challenge to the Modi regime and were met with brute force by the state. Dozens were killed by police fire and activists were detained and tortured.\n\nIn the months that followed, many of those who had been prominent protest organisers and voices began to be accused of acts of terror, while figures associated with Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party who had made direct calls to violence in Delhi just before the riots erupted faced no action.\n\nKhalid has denied all charges, and the case against him and other Muslim activists named in the police charges has drawn scrutiny and criticism from lawyers and human rights groups. Much of the case against him concerns alleged secret meetings disclosed by uncorroborated witnesses and his membership of certain WhatsApp groups where he did not post any messages. Khalid was not in Delhi when the riots took place and the speech he is accused of making to stir up the riots took place more than 1,000 miles away in Maharashtra state.\n\nIt was here, on camera, where Khalid told a crowd: \u201cWe won\u2019t respond to violence with violence. We won\u2019t respond to hate with hate. If they spread hate, we will respond to it with love.\u201d\n\nIn a mounting number of Delhi riots cases, the Delhi police have been found by judges to have fabricated evidence, created fictitious witnesses and forced witnesses to record statements dictated by officers. Delhi police have not responded to these allegations.\n\nShuddhabrata Sengupta, a friend of Khalid\u2019s who has written extensively about his case, said the Kafkaesque situation Khalid had been put through in trying to get bail demonstrated that \u201cthe process is the punishment here\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe message it is intended to give is clear: that if you are a Muslim in India today, and you dare to stand up for your rights and for peace and non-violence, you will be persecuted,\u201d Sengupta said.\n\nIn a joint statement released on the fifth anniversary of Khalid\u2019s detention last week, Amnesty International and six other human rights organisations condemned his \u201ccontinued unjust detention without trial\u201d and called for his immediate release.\n\n\u201cStarved of justice, Khalid\u2019s prolonged persecution exemplifies the derailment of justice in India as it makes a mockery of international human rights principles,\u201d said Aakar Patel, the chair of Amnesty India, whose operations were shut down by the Modi government in 2020. \u201cKhalid\u2019s detention is not an isolated case and is emblematic of a broader pattern of repression faced by those who dare to exercise their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.\u201d\n\nBefore his arrest, Khalid had made himself a thorn in the side of the Modi government, which came to power in 2014. An outspoken student activist at Delhi\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), where he was studying for a PhD, he was vocal against the rising tide of anti-Muslim hatred and persecution under Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist regime. In 2016, after a protest against capital punishment drew national media attention, Khalid was arrested and briefly detained on sedition charges.\n\nIt was the beginning of what his partner, Banojyotsna Lahiri, 41, who was also a PhD student at JNU, described as a \u201ctargeted campaign of hate\u201d against Khalid by the Indian media, who routinely described him as \u201canti-national\u201d. In 2018, two men turned up to a Delhi event with guns and tried to kill Khalid as a \u201cgift for India\u201d.\n\nLahiri said Khalid had expected his arrest to come in 2020 and had even pre-recorded a video. However, she said they had never anticipated that five years later he would still be held as an alleged terrorist and denied the basic right to bail.\n\n\u201cUmar is everything this government hates,\u201d Lahiri said. \u201cHe is Muslim, he is an intellectual, he speaks about the oppressed, he is outspoken, he is fearless and he is an unapologetic dissenting voice. This is their attempt to silence him but it won\u2019t work. We are still fighting for democracy, and in the end the truth will win.\u201d\n\nLahiri visits him every week in prison where he insists they keep the conversation joyful and they laugh together, even as he lived through a deadly Covid wave sweeping through the prison and the extreme heat of Delhi summers. To feed his voracious reading appetite, she usually carries in tomes for him, and she estimated he had now read more than 300 books while in jail \u2013 everything from Russian classics to contemporary Indian fiction and political biographies.\n\nEach week he is allowed a 30-minute video call with his parents in Delhi, and his sisters who live abroad also regularly patch in. \u201cI want to tell you that Umar has no regrets, nor have the years in jail broken his spirit,\u201d said his father, Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas, recently.\n\nFor Khalid, although he acknowledged in his recent writings that \u201cnurturing hope in jail is a risky business\u201d, he said sometimes he found himself \u201camazed how I have survived so long in the same confined space\u201d. But he insisted that thanks to the solace of books and the resilience of his fellow prisoners, \u201cmostly I have been at peace\u201d."

But even as the neighbours fought wars against each other, carried out rival nuclear tests and conducted nightly shows of strength along their heavily militarised border, there was always one thing that brought them together: cricket.\n\nBut as the two sides came together on Sunday for a match in the Asia Cup tournament, the camaraderie that was once celebrated as cricket diplomacy had vanished.\n\nAt the end of the game \u2013 after India had won a crushing triumph \u2013 instead of the usual respectful handshake between the two sides, the Indian team simply walked off the field.\n\nThe match was the first meeting of the Indian and Pakistani teams since Delhi accused Islamabad of masterminding a terrorist attack in the disputed Indian region of Kashmir in April, which killed 26 people. Pakistan denied any involvement.\n\nIndia launched an armed response and fired missiles into Pakistan, leading to four days of tit-for-tat hostilities and exchanges of fire in May that pushed the two nuclear-armed countries closer to all-out war than they had been in decades.\n\nSpeaking after the match, India\u2019s captain, Suryakumar Yadav, said the decision not to shake hands had been a \u201cteam call\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe had come only to play,\u201d Yadav told Indian media. \u201cSome things are beyond sportsmanship. We dedicate this victory to our armed forces who took part in Operation Sindoor and stand with families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.\u201d\n\nIn response, Pakistan\u2019s captain, Salman Ali Agha, did not attend the post-match ceremony. Pakistan\u2019s coach, the New Zealander Mike Hesson, said their side had been \u201cready to shake hands at the end of the game. We were disappointed that our opposition didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s actions were met with outrage in Pakistan. The team lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council, calling for the referee to be removed \u2013 a demand the ICC refused. In a statement afterwards, the chair of the Pakistan Cricket Board, Mohsin Naqvi, said it was \u201cutterly disappointing to witness the lack of sportsmanship today\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have always advocated for sports and politics to be kept apart,\u201d Naqvi said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cCricket is a global sport that should unite rather than divide. Our concern has never been about individuals or governments, but about ensuring clarity, fairness in match protocols, and upholding the spirit of the game.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday night, amid threats by the Pakistan team to boycott the rest of the Asia Cup tournament, the match referee, Andy Pycroft, apologised to Agha, describing the handshake incident as a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d.\n\nAfter both sides qualified for the second group stage of the tournament, they will meet again on Sunday.\n\nObservers said last week\u2019s incident signalled the clear demise of cricket diplomacy \u2013 which until recently had helped keep politics off the field even at the lowest moments \u2013 and was evidence of just how much Indo-Pakistan relations had soured.\n\nIn 1987, Pakistan\u2019s president, the army general Zia-ul-Haq, made a surprise visit to India to watch a Test match \u2013 part of what he called a \u201ccricket for peace\u201d initiative \u2013 as tensions were rising between the two countries.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2007, the two countries played four successful Test series on each other\u2019s turf. In 2004, as the Indian team travelled to Pakistan, the Indian prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told them: \u201cWhether you win or lose doesn\u2019t matter to me, but while you are there, you must win the hearts of the Pakistani people.\u201d\n\nHowever, since the Mumbai attacks of 2008, which were orchestrated by terrorist groups operating from Pakistan, such cross-border sportsmanship has been increasingly rare, with cricket and politics becoming visibly intertwined in both countries.\n\nUnder India\u2019s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, who was elected in 2014, cricket has become increasingly utilised as a political tool. The country\u2019s largest cricket stadium was named after the prime minister, while the ICC, the sport\u2019s powerful global governing body, is run by Jay Shah, the son of India\u2019s home minister and Modi\u2019s closest ally, Amit Shah.\n\nIn Pakistan, where the heavily jingoistic and anti-India military governs behind the scenes, the cricket board chair, Naqvi, is also the minister of the interior.\n\nSushant Singh, an Indian defence analyst who previously served in the Indian army, said that \u201cinstead of building fraternal ties and people-to-people contact\u201d, the cricket field had now become \u201cthe site of playing out nationalist fantasies\u201d.\n\nThe former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi, who travelled to India several times for matches and described himself as a \u201cstaunch supporter of cricket diplomacy\u201d lamented its loss. He said every time he had played over the border he \u201creceived a lot of love and support from Indians\u201d and that in his two decades of playing, had \u201cnever witnessed such off-the-field behaviour from Indian players\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the past, the wars and conflict between both countries did not stop cricket matches,\u201d said Afridi. \u201cWe greeted each other with respect on the field and we did not see hatred among players. Even during tough times such as the Kargil conflict, we remained welcoming to each other and enjoyed meeting off the field as sportsmen.\u201d\n\nOsman Samiuddin, a senior editor at ESPNCricinfo and author of The Unquiet Ones: A History of Pakistan Cricket, said the two countries were now in an era where \u201cthe opposite of cricket diplomacy is happening\u201d.\n\nCiting other recent examples, such when India refused to travel to Pakistan for this year\u2019s Champions Trophy, he said: \u201cThey are actually now taking out their hostility through cricket \u2013 it\u2019s become both a vehicle and a proxy for the tense relations between the two countries.\u201d\n\nHe warned that India\u2019s actions at Sunday\u2019s match, and the refusal by the ICC to censure the captain for it, could set a \u201ca dangerous precedent for other players in the future\u201d when it came to keeping politics out of the game.\n\nSamiuddin said that given the regimes in both countries, he did not see a return of the old sporting camaraderie, on or off the field, anytime soon. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the political conditions in either country are encouraging enough for it.\u201d"

reasons, not least their seven-wicket thrashing of Pakistan in their Group A match on September 14.\n\nIn addition to their status as the ICC\u2019s top-ranked men\u2019s T20 team, Suryakumar Yadav\u2019s side are the tournament\u2019s defending champions and the reigning T20 champions.\n\nFor Pakistan, a lot more than two points will be on the line as they will look to put aside not only the embarrassing defeat but also events that transpired following their thumping loss, as India\u2019s players walked off the field without partaking in the customary post-match handshake.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the match:\n\nWhat happened in the last India vs Pakistan match?\n\nIndia stamped their authority on the match with the first ball, as Pakistan\u2019s opener Saim Ayub Ayub was caught out at point off Hardik Pandya\u2019s bowling and wicketkeeper Mohammad Haris followed suit in the next over as India\u2019s star bowler Jasprit Bumrah struck.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Shaheen Shah Afridi and leg-spin bowler Sufiyan Muqeem hit four fours and two sixes that Pakistan crossed the 100-run mark in their 19th over and finished at 128.\n\nThe target was never going to be enough for a power-packed Indian batting lineup, and opener Abhishek Sharma took the match away from Pakistan with his belligerent innings of 31 runs off 13 balls.\n\nYadav followed suit with 47 runs off 37 balls as India won their second match of the tournament.\n\nIndia walked away with two points and walked off without shaking hands with the Pakistan team, as is the norm after every cricket match.\n\nWhat happened after the match?\n\nYadav walked off the field alongside his batting partner, Shivam Dube, without approaching the Pakistani captain and team for the traditional post-match handshakes.\n\nPakistan\u2019s players trudged off in a group and waited for the Indian squad and support staff to come out and shake hands, as is the norm at the end of cricket matches.\n\nHowever, the Indian contingent only shook hands with each other before walking into their dressing room and shutting the door as the waiting Pakistan players looked on.\n\nWhy did India\u2019s players not shake hands with the Pakistani team?\n\n\u201cA few things in life are above sportsman\u2019s spirit,\u201d India\u2019s captain Yadav said when asked to clarify his team\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cWe stand with all the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack and with their families, and dedicate this win to our brave armed forces who took part in Operation Sindoor.\u201d\n\nYadav was referring to the Indian armed forces\u2019 multiple missile attacks on six locations inside Pakistan.\n\nHow did Pakistan respond?\n\nPakistan\u2019s manager Naveed Akram Cheema lodged a protest against the Indian cricket team\u2019s actions with Pycroft, who is an ICC accredited match referee.\n\nAdditionally, Pakistan captain Agha did not speak at the post-match captain\u2019s chat with the host broadcaster, in a mark of protest.\n\nThree days later, Pakistani officials deliberated pulling out of the tournament as a mark of protest, causing a delayed start to their match against the UAE.\n\nWhy is India \u2018hosting\u2019 the Asia Cup in the UAE?\n\nIndia was slated to host the tournament as per the hosting rights schedule, and while the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) remains the official host of the tournament, it is being played in the UAE due to the recent conflict between India and Pakistan.\n\nWhat\u2019s the weather forecast for India vs Pakistan in Dubai?\n\nThe weather forecast for Sunday is hot and humid, with highs of 41 degrees Celsius (106 degrees Fahrenheit) and partial cloud cover.\n\nIt will get slightly cooler in the evening as the match will start just after sunset, and the temperature will drop to 31C (88F).\n\nHow many times has Pakistan won the Asia Cup?\n\nPakistan have lifted the trophy on two occasions \u2013 in 2000 and 2012 \u2013 and qualified for the final five times.\n\nIndia are seven-time Asia Cup champions, with 11 appearances in the final.\n\nHow many times has India beaten Pakistan in the Asia Cup?\n\nIn their 20 clashes in the Asia Cup, India have beaten Pakistan 11 times and lost to their neighbours on six occasions. Three matches, including the group-stage match in 2023, were abandoned due to poor weather.\n\nWhen was the last time Pakistan beat India?\n\nPakistan\u2019s last Asia Cup win over India came in the 2022 edition in the UAE. Mohammad Rizwan top-scored with 71 runs in the Super Four clash, but it was Mohammad Nawaz\u2019s 20-ball-41 that took Pakistan over the line in the run chase.\n\nIndia vs Pakistan: Head-to-head in T20Is\n\nSince the inaugural ICC T20 World Cup in 2007, the countries have met in 14 T20Is. India has won 11 times, including the first match in 2007, which was tied and then decided in a Super Over.\n\nTwo of Pakistan\u2019s three wins came in Dubai.\n\nPlayers to watch: India\n\nAbhishek Sharma: The fact that the young top-order batter has managed to carve a spot in a highly competitive T20 Indian batting lineup is enough to mark Sharma as one to watch in the Asia Cup. The 24-year-old boasts the highest career strike rate of 198 among all batters in T20s and backs it up with two centuries and half-centuries in the format.\n\nVarun Chakaravarthy: The 34-year-old leg-spin bowler\u2019s second foray into the Indian side has reaped him big rewards as he has taken 35 wickets in 20 T20I matches.\n\nPlayers to watch: Pakistan\n\nHasan Nawaz: Pakistan have often been criticised for their batters\u2019 inability to match modern-day T20 batting strike rates, but in Nawaz, they seem to have found a solution to this problem. The 23-year-old has a strike rate of 174, with a T20 hundred and two fifties in his 16 matches.\n\nSufiyan Muqeem: The left-arm wrist spinner has taken 27 wickets in his 19 T20Is since making his debut less than two years ago and has become a mainstay of the bowling lineup in limited-overs cricket.\n\nForm guide: India\n\nIndia are unbeaten in the Asia Cup and have not lost a T20 series since winning the World Cup in June 2024.\n\nLast five results (most recent first): W-W-W-W-W\n\nForm guide: Pakistan\n\nPakistan\u2019s form in T20s has been mixed of late and but they head into the marquee clash with a series win in the bag.\n\nLast five results (most recent first): W-L-W-W-L\n\nTeam news: India\n\nAfter resting a couple of their star bowlers in the game against Oman, the holders are expected to go back to the same team that beat Pakistan in the group stage.\n\nPredicted XI: Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav (captain), Sanju Samson (wicketkeeper), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav.\n\nTeam news: Pakistan\n\nDespite the loss on Sunday, Pakistan are expected to field the same XI and will hope the result goes their way this time.\n\nPredicted XI: Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Haris (wicketkeeper), Salman Agha (captain), Hasan Nawaz, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Faheem Ashraf, Abrar Ahmed, Sufiyan Muqeem.\n\nWhere can I buy tickets for India vs Pakistan?\n\nA selection of seats, starting at $95 apiece for the general stand and going up to $8,767 for a four-person hospitality box, is still available on the tournament\u2019s official ticketing website, Platinumlist, and at the stadium\u2019s ticketing office."

                "text": "The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been urged to cancel plans to be the guest of honour at an event hosted by the chief lobbyist of the gambling industry while the Treasury is in the midst of a review of taxes on the \u00a312bn sector.\n\nReeves is slated to appear at a \u201cprivate reception\u201d for business leaders, organised by the corporate communications company Brunswick, at the forthcoming Labour party conference in Liverpool.\n\nAccording to an invitation seen by the Guardian, the event will be hosted by Michael Dugher, the chair of the Betting & Gaming Council (BGC), who joined Brunswick as a part-time \u201csenior adviser\u201d last year.\n\nDugher, a former Labour MP who stepped down during Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s stint as party leader, has since built a career as a pugnacious and sometimes controversial champion of Britain\u2019s gambling industry.\n\nHe recently told the BGC\u2019s members, including online casinos and bookmakers, of his efforts to talk the Treasury out of plans to increase taxes on the sector to help fund the public finances.\n\nGambling companies could save billions of pounds if Reeves ignores calls to raise duties on online gambling, including from the former prime minister Gordon Brown.\n\nReeves and Dugher have a longstanding political and personal friendship stretching back to their teenage years.\n\nBut MPs and a parliamentary standards campaigner said the chancellor should refuse his invitation, questioning the \u201cvery strange timing\u201d.\n\nThe former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the decision \u201craises real questions about the chancellor\u2019s judgment and impartiality on this matter particularly when it is already widely known that she has taken both recent hospitality and donations from the sector\u201d.\n\nReeves accepted three tickets to a musical worth \u00a3330, courtesy of the BGC in 2023 as well as \u00a320,000 in donations from gambling executives while Labour was in opposition.\n\n\u201cThe chancellor should think long and hard about whether she should appear at this event,\u201d said Daisy Cooper MP, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Treasury spokesperson.\n\n\u201cOnline gambling is one of the places where she should be looking to raise revenue for our public services. If she fails to do so at the budget she will have serious questions to answer over whether events like this one influenced her at all.\n\n\u201cTo show she cares about taxpayers more than big gambling firms the chancellor should commit to raising taxes on online gambling giants ahead of the budget.\u201d\n\nBrunswick said Dugher\u2019s role in the gambling industry was \u201ccompletely separate\u201d from his work for the public relations firm.\n\nThe debate over whether to raise taxes on gambling puts Dugher at the centre of a tug of war between leading Labour figures with whom he has longstanding ties.\n\nDugher was formerly a special adviser to Brown, who has called for taxes on online gambling to rise by as much as \u00a33bn to help fund an end to the two-child benefit cap.\n\nBut Dugher also has a longstanding relationship with Reeves, with whom he claimed to have been \u201cin touch\u201d earlier this year during the BGC\u2019s tax campaign, which included hosting a darts-themed event with the Paddy Power owner, Flutter.\n\nReeves said at the time that she had no formal meeting with the BGC and would not ever have discussed the tax changes.\n\nThe pair\u2019s friendship stretches back to their teenage years, while they also once shared a parliamentary office in Westminster.\n\nThey will reunite for the Brunswick event on 28 September, weeks before Reeves announces her second budget as chancellor, at which any new taxes on online casinos could be revealed.\n\n\u201cVery strange timing for such an event,\u201d said Tom Brake, a former Liberal Democrat MP and director of Unlock Democracy, a campaign group that advocates for improved parliamentary standards.\n\nHe said Reeves \u201cshould have politely declined\u201d the invitation, adding that her acceptance was the sort of thing that could be considered by a new standards body, the ethics and integrity commission, due to be established next month.\n\nA spokesperson for Brunswick said: \u201cFor many years Brunswick has hosted a reception at the Labour party conference which enables senior business leaders to engage with a number of ministers and MPs.\n\n\u201cMichael is a part-time senior adviser to Brunswick, and his work with us is completely separate from his other roles. He will be hosting the event jointly alongside partners from Brunswick\u2019s public affairs team.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian approached the chancellor for comment."

                "text": "Deep below the seabed, 80 miles off the coast of Yorkshire, is a remarkable crater that has divided scientists \u2013 was it, thrillingly, created by an asteroid crash? Or more mundanely was it the result of geological salt movements?\n\nToday, the decades-long scientific debate can be settled. The Silverpit crater 700 metres below the seabed under the North Sea was in all likelihood created by a direct hit from an asteroid or comet about the size of York Minster that hurtled towards the Earth more than 43m years ago.\n\nThe 160-metre-wide asteroid smashed into the sea causing a 100-metre-high tsunami, say scientists. It was probably a very bad day for any early mammals in the area \u2013 but not as bad as the consequences of the asteroid smash that wiped out the dinosaurs 66m years ago.\n\nThe Silverpit crater is nowhere near the scale of the Chicxulub crater in Mexico, when an asteroid about 6 to 9 miles wide struck Earth, resulting in a mass extinction of 75% of plant and animal species. But it is still interesting and, as the only impact crater near what is now the UK, extremely important, say experts.\n\nUisdean Nicholson, a sedimentologist from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh who led the research team, said new seismic imaging had given them an unprecedented look at the crater.\n\nGetting the proof was \u201cdefinitely an exciting moment\u201d, he said, describing the investigation as \u201ca needle in the haystack approach\u201d.\n\nThe 2-mile-wide crater, surrounded by a 12-mile wide zone of circular faults, was discovered in 2002 by petroleum geoscientists.\n\nThose who found it believed it was indeed a hypervelocity impact crater, pointing to characteristics often associated with them including a central peak, circular shape and concentric faults.\n\nIt was initially estimated to be more than 60m years old and it made headlines. \u201cCrater could be asteroid strike,\u201d read a Guardian report from the time.\n\nBut some scientists were not convinced, arguing that it had a far less interesting origin story \u2013 it was most likely caused by the movement of salt rocks at depth.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m spoiling the party,\u201d said the geologist Prof John Underhill, from the University of Edinburgh, who led the doubters at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s a less glamorous explanation, but that\u2019s what the scientific data is saying.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, there was a debate at the Geological Society that Nicholson remembers. \u201cI was a PhD student at the time and it was quite a well-known debate, within geological circles at least.\n\n\u201cThey had the big debate and then they had a vote. It was overwhelmingly decided that it was a non-impact origin. Most people favoured the mundane explanation and I think that reflects a tendency to reject the more spectacular explanation.\u201d\n\nThe vote was 80-20 against the impact hypothesis, raising the question of whether geologists are naturally conservative. \u201cThere are different flavours of geologist,\u201d said Nicholson. \u201cPeople say I get too excited by certain ideas.\u201d\n\nNicholson was asked to look at Silverpit because of his experience discovering another impact crater in west Africa.\n\nWith financing from the Natural Environment Research Council the Nicholson-led team used seismic imaging, microscopic analysis of rock cuttings and numerical models to provide what they say is the strongest evidence yet that Silverpit is one of Earth\u2019s impact craters.\n\nAsteroid crashes are mercifully rare, with none in recorded human history. The craters left by the impacts are also rare because \u201cplate tectonics and erosion destroy almost all traces of most of these events\u201d, Nicholson said. \u201cAround 200 confirmed impact craters exist on land and only 33 have been identified beneath the ocean.\u201d\n\nSilverpit is exceptionally preserved and important, he said. \u201cWe can use these findings to understand how asteroid impacts shaped our planet throughout history, as well as predict what could happen should we have an asteroid collision in future.\u201d"

        "Summary of Cluster": "In 2024, American high school seniors experienced a significant decline in academic performance, achieving their lowest average scores in reading and math in two decades, with only 35% proficient in reading and 22% in math, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Contributing factors such as increased absenteeism, greater screen time, and disengagement, which some experts believe were issues even before the COVID-19 pandemic, have sparked discussions about the need for enhanced educational funding and a national strategy to improve student outcomes. Concurrently, Gen Z's credit scores have also seen a notable drop, attributed mainly to the burden of student loan debt, with an average score of 676 and 34% of this generation holding open student loans. Experts advise that timely payments and effective credit management are crucial for improving credit scores, which are vital for accessing financial services.",

                "text": "The average reading and math scores of American high school seniors fell to their lowest levels in two decades in 2024, according to new national data released last week.\n\nThe results, from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), found that, on average, reading scores for 12th graders were 10 points lower in 2024 than they were in 1992, when the test was first administered, and that math scores fell to their lowest levels since 2005, when the math assessment began.\n\nThe test, administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which is part of the US Department of Education, assessed roughly 19,300 12th-graders in math, 24,300 in reading and 23,000 eighth-graders in science between January and March of last year.\n\nThe report found that 35% of seniors \u201cperformed at or above\u201d the NAEP\u2019s \u201cproficient\u201d level in reading, and 22% were at or above that level in math.\n\nIt also stated that 45% of 12th graders scored below the NAEP\u2019s \u201cbasic\u201d level in math, marking a five percentage-point increase from 2019. In reading, 32% of students scored below the basic level, which was a two-point increase from 2019.\n\n\u201cThese results are sobering,\u201d said NCES acting commissioner Matthew Soldner. \u201cThe drop in overall scores coincides with significant declines in achievement among our lowest-performing students, continuing a downward trend that began before the Covid pandemic.\n\n\u201cAmong our nation\u2019s high-school seniors, we\u2019re now seeing a larger percentage of students scoring below the NAEP basic achievement level in mathematics and reading than in any previous assessment.\u201d\n\nOne lingering effect of the pandemic present in the report was chronic absenteeism. The report found that about a third of 12th-graders reported missing three or more days of school in the month before the test, up from 25% in 2019.\n\n\u201cStudents are spending less time learning,\u201d said Thomas Kane, an education economist at Harvard. \u201cAnd when they are present, instruction is less efficient because teachers are constantly reteaching material.\u201d\n\nRobert Balfanz, a professor at John Hopkins University School of Education, said easy access to information online and the use of online assignments may also be leading some students to treat in-person school attendance as optional.\n\n\u201cIn their minds, they tell their parents, \u2018Look, all my assignments are online, I can do them even if I\u2019m not at school,\u2019\u201d Balfanz said.\n\nBut while the Covid pandemic and school closures had major effects on learning, experts say the academic decline began before 2020.\n\n\u201cThe uncomfortable truth is that American students have been significantly losing ground for more than a decade,\u201d Eric Hanushek, an education economist, wrote in an opinion piece last week. \u201cThe pandemic didn\u2019t break American education \u2013 it was already broken.\u201d\n\nKane said the decline among lower-achieving students began some time around 2015 and has continued.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly not just the pandemic,\u201d Kane said. \u201cIt should be troubling to everyone, and we need to find a solution.\u201d\n\nExperts point to a range of potential factors beyond absenteeism that could be contributing to the decline, including increased screen time and smartphone use, declining student engagement, and the rollback of test-based accountability since the expiration of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2015.\n\nCarol Jago, a longtime English teacher and literacy expert at UCLA, told the Associated Press last week that students today read fewer books and spend less time with longer texts.\n\n\u201cTo be a good reader, you have to have the stamina to stay on the page, even when the going gets tough,\u201d Jago said. \u201cYou have to build those muscles, and we\u2019re not building those muscles in kids.\u201d\n\nBalfanz added that the constant exposure to short-form and visual media in students\u2019 daily lives may be making academic focus more difficult.\n\nOne potential solution, he said, could be to add more dedicated reading time into school days \u2013 and restricting smartphones in classrooms.\n\nKane noted that academic declines are appearing in other countries as well, which suggests a broader global trend that could be linked to increased screen use.\n\nSome US states have already passed laws restricting phone use in schools. Kane believes that there needs to be a national effort to assess the impact and effectiveness of those policies to see whether they work and ought to be implemented in more areas.\n\nThe role of smart phones and social media in academic performance came up this week during a Senate hearing on the NAEP results.\n\nMartin West, the vice-chair of the National Assessment Governing Board, which oversees policy for the NAEP, told lawmakers that the rise of \u201csmartphones and social media platforms targeting youth\u201d is one area they should investigate.\n\n\u201cWe lack direct evidence of a causal link between smartphones and learning, but I\u2019m convinced that this technology is a key driver of youth mental health challenges, a distraction from learning, both inside and outside of schools, and a deterrent to reading,\u201d West said.\n\nRebecca Winthrop, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, testified that student disengagement was exacerbated by the pandemic and is being amplified by social media. She endorsed actions such as smart phone bans, higher academic expectations, and adopting more engaging teaching styles.\n\nThe NAEP results also reignited the debate around the federal government\u2019s role in education, with US education secretary Linda McMahon saying last week that the lesson from the results \u201cis clear\u201d.\n\n\u201cSuccess isn\u2019t about how much money we spend, but who controls the money and where that money is invested,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why President Trump and I are committed to returning control of education to the states so they can innovate and meet each school and students\u2019 unique needs.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Tim Walberg, a Republican who chairs the House education committee, agreed and said that \u201cby returning education to the states, we can empower parents and local communities and ensure every child gains the skills necessary to succeed\u201d.\n\nBut Democratic representative Bobby Scott pushed back, writing that the NAEP results \u201creinforce the urgent need for sustained federal investment in academic recovery and educational equity\u201d.\n\n\u201cNow is not the time to retreat from our responsibility to provide every child, regardless of zip code, with the opportunity to succeed,\u201d he added.\n\nBalfanz believes that \u201csome collective effort at the national level\u201d is needed to support states and districts in implementing proven solutions. He emphasized the need to \u201cset targets and goals and strategies\u201d and help build the capacity at the local level to be able to achieve them.\n\nKane said that he agrees that states need to take a \u201cmore aggressive role in helping to reverse these trends\u201d but that the federal government also needs to prioritize partnering with states \u201cin a concerted, coordinated effort to answer two questions: finding effective ways to lower absenteeism and measuring the impact of the cellphone bans\u201d.\n\n\u201cSomething fundamental in US schools is broken,\u201d Kane warned. \u201cAnd we need to fix it.\u201d"

Credit scores are based on your credit history and range from 300 to 850.\n\nThe report found that 34% of Gen Z consumers have open student loans, compared to 17% of the total population, and the decline in credit scores is primarily due to the resumption of student loan delinquency reporting.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education paused federal student loan payments in March 2020, offering borrowers relief during the economic chaos of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThough payments were set to resume in 2023, the Biden administration provided a one-year grace period that ended in October 2024.\n\nThis summer, the Trump administration restarted the collection process for outstanding student loans, with plans to seize wages and tax refunds if the loans continue to go unpaid.\n\nRoughly 5.3 million borrowers who are in default could have their wages garnished by the federal government.\n\nBetween student loans, a tough job market, and high inflation, young consumers are struggling to make payments on time, according to the report.\n\nA low credit score makes it more complicated or more expensive to obtain car loans, mortgages, credit cards, auto insurance, and other financial services.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had so many different ongoing causes of economic instability that have really been with them as they\u2019ve been growing up; those factors make it a lot harder for this generation to stay financially stable,\u201d said Courtney Alev, consumer advocate at Credit Karma.\n\nHowever, younger consumers also have the advantage of having the most potential for score improvement, Tommy Lee, senior director at FICO.\n\nIf your credit score has dropped recently, here are some experts\u2019 recommendations:\n\nDon\u2019t avoid knowing your score\n\nIt\u2019s common to be afraid of checking your credit score, but it\u2019s best not to avoid it, Alev said.\n\nKnowing your current score, whether it\u2019s good or not great, can help you make a plan for the future.\n\n\u201cYou need to know where you stand to be able to take action,\u201d Alev said.\n\nExperian, FICO and Credit Karma are among the companies that let you check your credit score for free.\n\nWhile your credit score is essential to keep your financial life healthy, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s just a number and it doesn\u2019t define you as a person, added Alev.\n\nPay on time\n\nWhen it comes to the score calculation, one of the most critical factors is paying on time, whether that\u2019s the minimum payment or the full balance.\n\n\u201cThe one most important factor in the FICO score calculation is whether you make your payments on time. And that\u2019s about 35% of the score calculation,\u201d Lee said.\n\nIf you\u2019re juggling several credit card payments and other debts, Alev recommends that you set automatic payments.\n\nKeep your credit balance low\n\nKeeping your credit utilization low and avoiding acquiring new debt can help you increase your credit score.\n\nCredit utilization is the percentage of the credit you\u2019re currently using from across all your available credit.\n\nWhile a low percentage is good for your credit score, it\u2019s not recommended to have your credit utilization at 0%.\n\nInstead experts recommend you keep it between 10% and 30%.\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to pay off the debt you currently have, it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t acquire more debt if you can avoid it.\n\nCredit scores change as your financial behavior does, so Lee recommends that if you\u2019re not happy with your current credit score, you look to implement new habits in your financial life.\n\n\u201cThe FICO score is dynamic. It changes based on how you make your payments. So your score, if you want to maintain it or improve it, you can do so by exhibiting good credit behavior,\u201d Lee said."

While the exact motive is still not known, on Sunday - before Kimmel spoke - the Utah governor had said the suspect was \"indoctrinated by leftist ideology\".\n\nThe FCC is in charge of granting broadcast licences to networks such as ABC, NBC and CBS, and they are required under statute to be in the public interest.\n\nOn his podcast Verdict with Ted Cruz, the senator emphasised on Friday that he hated what Kimmel said about Kirk, and he is \"thrilled that he was fired\". He also said Carr was \"a good guy\".\n\n\"But what he [Carr] said there is dangerous as hell,\" Cruz added. \"And so he threatens, explicitly, we're going to cancel ABC's licence.\n\n\"We're going to take them off the air so ABC cannot broadcast anymore.

They will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly. And that is dangerous,\" Cruz said.\n\nIn the Oval Office on Friday, President Donald Trump defended Carr and said \"I disagree with Ted Cruz\", who is ordinarily one of his staunchest allies.\n\nAnother Republican Senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, told reporters that Cruz was \"absolutely right\" in his criticism of Carr.\n\nTillis, who will not seek re-election next year, said the FCC chairman's comments were \"just unacceptable behaviour\".\n\nRepublicans in Congress have generally been toeing the party line with their response to Kimmel's suspension as the nation is shaken by the political and cultural aftershocks of Kirk's killing.\n\nBut Senator Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas, sounded a note of caution on Thursday.\n\n\"The conservative position is free speech is free speech, and we better be very careful about any lines we cross in diminishing free speech,\" Moran told Politico.\n\nSouth Dakota Senator Mike Rounds said he would approach it as an \"employer-employee issue\".\n\nKimmel has not publicly commented about his suspension, but his late-night colleagues - including Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert - responded on Thursday with a show of solidarity.\n\nKirk was fatally shot on 10 September during an open-air event on a Utah college campus.\n\nThe motive behind Charlie Kirk's killing: What we know and don't know\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate passed a resolution to designate 14 October - Kirk's birthday - a day of remembrance for him.\n\nLawmakers in the US House of Representatives approved the resolution, but nearly 100 Democrats opposed it.\n\nIn Sacramento, California, police said three shots were fired on Friday afternoon into a window of an ABC10 building while people were inside.\n\nThe shots came from a moving vehicle and nobody was injured, police said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the shooting was a targeted attack or an accidental discharge of a weapon.\n\nABC10 is an affiliate operated by Nexstar, one of the major media companies that cancelled Jimmy Kimmel Live! from its markets this week, citing the host's \"offensive and insensitive\" comments about Kirk."

                "text": "Immigrant advocacy organizations and activists are bracing for a crackdown from the federal government following threats from the Trump administration to root out and criminally prosecute non-profit groups it believes are sympathetic to \u201cleftwing\u201d politics.\n\nDonald Trump and his closest allies have periodically threatened immigrant rights activists and nonprofits, including those that distribute food and water to migrants or provide immigrants with legal services, with arrest. But their rhetoric has been heightened in the days following the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk this month.\n\nOver the last week, JD Vance described civil rights groups as a \u201cdomestic terror movement\u201d, while Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide and the architect of the US president\u2019s mass deportation agenda, vowed that the administration would hold nonprofits, including immigrant-rights and police-reform organizations, \u201ccriminally liable\u201d for what he baselessly described as \u201ccoordinated attacks\u201d on Ice agents.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) followed up with a warning: \u201cAnyone \u2013 regardless of immigration status \u2013 who assaults an Ice officer will face federal felony assault charges and prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), meanwhile, has expanded its definition of \u201cthreats\u201d to include the filming Ice operations.\n\nFor Brandon Lee, communications director of the immigrant rights non-profit the Illinois Coalition For Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR) the threats represented \u201cyet another moment where the Trump administration is attempting to curtail speech, curtail organizing, to scare our people\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is another example of the atmosphere of fear that the administration is trying to create,\u201d said Lee.\n\nAdvocates and activists told the Guardian that they are advising staff and volunteers to practice caution while assisting immigrants and filming raids, while also maintaining that they will not \u201ccomply in advance\u201d and give up their first amendment rights to document immigration enforcement.\n\nICIRR, which organizes teams to observe raids and help the families of those affected access legal aid and other resources, has always \u201cbeen operating within the boundaries of the law\u201d, Lee said.\n\n\u201cIn our rapid-response teams, our role is not to intervene in Ice operations. Our team members are aware of their rights to film in public spaces, to share information,\u201d he said. The organization tends to send out volunteers in pairs or groups, and advises them to maintain a distance from officers.\n\nLee said the latest rhetoric from the Trump administration felt \u201cheightened\u201d, but added groups like his have been dealing with these threats for months. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if these tactics are different from what they\u2019ve been threatening throughout the year so far,\u201d said Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve threatened to go after nonprofits. It\u2019s not the first time that they\u2019ve threatened to go after charitable foundations.\u201d\n\nFederal agents have already, increasingly, been arresting elected officials, protestors and bystanders at immigration raids and detention centers. In New York on Thursday, federal agents and local police arrested a total of at least 71 people \u2013 including Democratic lawmakers and activists \u2013 who were protesting at a federal building where Ice has been detaining immigrants. Lawmakers had requested access to Ice detention cells and were arrested by federal officers inside the building, while another group had attempted to block the garage doors typically used by Ice to move vans carrying detained immigrants, and the New York Police Department made arrests.\n\nOn Friday, federal law enforcement agents used teargas and pepper balls to disperse a group of about 100 protesters, including two Democratic candidates for Congress, during a series of early morning clashes outside an Ice building on the outskirts of Chicago, and people were apprehended.\n\nThe arrests were part of a pattern of aggressive tactics used against protesters and lawmakers seeking to shed light on conditions inside Ice facilities and demonstrate against the agency\u2019s raids.\n\nIn May, New Jersey congresswoman LaMonica McIver was charged with assaulting or impeding federal agents as they arrested the Newark mayor Ras Baraka, who was there with a group of lawmakers trying to observe a detention center. In legal filings, McIver has said the indictment overstates the moments of physical contact between McIver and agents arresting the mayor, and notes that McIver\u2019s actions were part of her authorized oversight duties as a congresswoman.\n\nSeveral charges against protestors have ultimately been dropped or proved to have been exaggerated. A Guardian review of cases brought against anti-Ice protesters in Los Angeles this summer found that several charges were based on false or misleading statements from law enforcement.\n\nThis week, a jury found Brayan Ramos-Brito, a protester in Los Angeles, not guilty of assaulting a border agent, after footage from a witness \u2013 and published by the Guardian \u2013 showed an agent forcefully shoving Ramos-Brito, whereas there was no footage of Ramos-Brito assaulting the officer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in an environment and you see a level of aggressiveness [from Ice and other federal agencies] that perhaps you haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d said Armando Gudino, executive director of the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, a group that advocates for immigrant workers in the city.\n\nAnd, Gudino said, he expects Ice and the DHS could ramp up arrests of advocates and activists. \u201cThe unfortunate assassination of this individual, we feel, is only going to compound the challenges that we\u2019ve been experiencing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing officials, however opportunistically, are blaming immigrants and advocates for the murder of Charlie Kirk.\u201d\n\nBut many immigrant rights and civil rights groups said that at least for now, they are planning to work as normal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to serve. We\u2019ll continue to follow. And we\u2019ll continue to do the best that we can under the circumstances. And, you know, we can only hope that, you know, justice and fairness will prevail,\u201d said Melissa L Marantes, executive director of the Orlando Center for Justice, which provides legal aid for immigrants and their families.\n\nThat resilience chimed in Texas.\n\n\u201cWhat gives me a little bit of hope is that \u2013 at least in the nonprofit social justice and immigrant justice movement here in Texas \u2013 I think we\u2019re tougher than big corporate media and big law,\u201d said Dustin Rynders, legal director, Texas Civil Rights Project, a nonprofit that advocates for a legal advocacy organization. \u201cWe\u2019re all fighters.\u201d\n\nAnd for some groups, particularly those who organized during Trump\u2019s first time in office, the crackdown feels all too familiar.\n\nProject South, an advocacy group based in Atlanta, has for decades helped mobilize communities in the south to push for policy changes, organize protests and provide legal support. In 2020, the group represented an Ice nurse whistleblower who said immigrant women detained at an immigration jail in Georgia were being subjected to non-consensual gynecological procedures, including hysterectomies.\n\nProject South has learned from its experiences from that period, said Azadeh Shahshahani, the legal and advocacy director for the group. Back in 2017, Project South and other groups were surveilled by Ice after they sought to raise awareness about a suicide at a Georgia detention center.\n\n\u201cInstead of cowering in fear, we will continue to organize our communities and protect and defend each other,\u201d Shahshahani added.\n\nJos\u00e9 Olivares and Alexandra Villarreal contributed reporting"

                "summary": "Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old woman who has lived in the U.S. for over three decades, was arrested by ICE after her asylum applications were denied. Her family reported that during a visit, she expressed despair about her detention, stating she would rather die than remain in the facility. The case has sparked outrage within the Sikh community and among lawmakers, highlighting concerns about the treatment of immigrants without criminal records amid increased immigration enforcement under the Trump administration.",
                "source": "BBC",
                "text": "The visiting room of the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Centre in Bakersfield, California, is small, loud, and crowded. When Harjit Kaur's family arrived to see her, they could barely hear her - and the first words they caught shattered them.\n\n\"She said, 'I would rather die than be in this facility. May God just take me now',\" recalled her distraught daughter-in-law, Manjit Kaur.\n\nHarjit Kaur, 73, who unsuccessfully applied for asylum in the US, and has lived in California for more than three decades, was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials on 8 September, sparking shock and sympathy from the Sikh community across the state and beyond.\n\nHarjit Kaur had filed several asylum appeals over the years which were rejected, with the last denial in 2012, her lawyer said.\n\nSince then, she had been asked to report to immigration authorities every six months. She was arrested in San Francisco when she had gone for a check-in.\n\nIt comes amid a wider crackdown by the Donald Trump administration on immigration, and especially alleged illegal immigrants in the US.\n\nThe issue is a sensitive one - the country is grappling with how to deal with the hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers who arrive at its borders every year. More than 3.7 million asylum cases are pending in immigration courts. An increased budget for immigration enforcement means ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency.\n\nTrump has said he wants to deport the \"worst of the worst\", but critics say immigrants without criminal records who follow due process have also been targeted.\n\n\"Over 70% of people arrested by ICE have no criminal conviction,\" said California State Senator Jesse Arreguin in a statement demanding Harjit Kaur's release. \"Now, they are literally going after peaceful grandmothers. This shameful act is harming our communities.\"\n\nUS Congressman John Garamendi, who represents the Californian district where Harjit Kaur lives, has submitted a request to ICE for her release.\n\n\"This administration's decision to detain a 73-year-old woman - a respected member of the community with no criminal record who has faithfully reported to ICE every six months for more than 13 years - is one more example of the misplaced priorities of Trump's immigration enforcement,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nIn an emailed statement, ICE told the BBC that Harjit Kaur had \"exhausted decades of due process\" and that an immigration judge had ordered her removal in 2005.\n\n\"Harjit Kaur has filed multiple appeals all the way up to the Ninth Circuit Court of appeals and LOST each time. Now that she has exhausted all legal remedies, ICE is enforcing US law and the orders by the judge; she will not waste any more US tax dollars,\" it added.\n\nTrump orders increase in migrant deportations\n\nIndia 'will do what's right' on illegal immigration - Trump\n\nHarjit Kaur came to the US in 1991 with her two minor sons after the death of her husband, her lawyer Deepak Ahluwalia told the BBC. Her daughter-in-law Manjit Kaur said that the young widow wanted to shield her sons from and escape the political turbulence in India's Punjab state at the time.\n\nOver the next three decades, she worked modest jobs to raise her sons, one of whom is now a US citizen. Her five grandchildren are also US citizens.\n\nHarjit Kaur, who lives in Hercules city in the San Francisco Bay Area, was working as a seamstress at a sari store for the past two decades and pays her taxes. Asylum applicants across the US are allowed to live, work and pay taxes legally once their claim is officially filed and in process.\n\nEven after her final asylum appeal was rejected in 2012, her job permit was renewed every year.\n\nAfter the rejection, her deportation seemed imminent, but she didn't have the right documents to travel to India.\n\nIndian missions in the US issue emergency certificates - a one-way travel document - to Indians of invalid status to enable them to return. This would require verifying Harjit Kaur's origin and identity in Punjab through photos, cross-checking with relatives or acquaintances or finding old records, which would take at least a few weeks.\n\nMore than a decade since the rejection, neither Harjit Kaur nor US immigration officials have been able to get a travel permit for her. Manjit Kaur said they visited the Indian consulate in San Francisco in 2013 for this but didn't succeed. India's Consul General at San Francisco K Srikar Reddy told the BBC they had no record of Harjit Kaur applying for travel documents to India.\n\nICE did not respond to a question about why it did not get a travel permit in the past 13 years.\n\nMr Ahluwalia said he is following up with the Indian consulate for the documents which \"ICE was unable to procure for the last 13 years\". The consulate says they are \"facilitating all necessary consular assistance\".\n\nHarjit Kaur's family, meanwhile, say she never questioned her deportation and should not have been detained.\n\n\"Provide us the travel documents and she is ready to go,\" Manjit Kaur said. \"She had even packed her suitcases back in 2012.\"\n\nRight now, their immediate concern is getting her out of the detention centre.\n\n\"You can put an ankle monitor on her. We can check in with immigration when you want,\" said Manjit Kaur. \"Just get her out of the facility and when you provide us the travel documents, she will self-deport to India.\"\n\nHer lawyer said that when he met Harjit Kaur on 15 September, she had not been provided with her regular medication. He alleged that she had been \"dragged by guards\", \"denied a chair or a bed\" and was \"forced to sit on the floor\" for hours in a holding cell despite having undergone double knee replacement.\n\nHe also alleged that she was \"explicitly refused water\" and not provided a vegetarian meal for the first six days.\n\nICE did not respond to specific questions on these allegations, but had earlier told BBC Punjabi that \"it is a long-standing policy that as soon as someone comes into ICE custody, they are given full health care\".\n\nDetainees have access to \"medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care\" and no-one \"is denied essential care at any time during detention\", it added.\n\nKulvinder Singh Pannu, president of the gurdwara committee at The Sikh Centre in San Francisco Bay Area, says that Bibi Harjit (a respectful way to refer to an elderly Punjabi woman) is well-liked in the area.\n\n\"She always helped people in our community with whatever she had financially,\" he said.\n\n\"A couple of hundred people turned up by themselves to protest against her arrest,\" he said, referring to a 12 September agitation outside the Sikh temple in California.\n\nAs the uncertainty continues, Harjit Kaur's supporters are planning to hold more protests, including in other US cities, with many saying they are touched by her plight.\n\nA single mother, Harjit Kaur had formed deep roots and relationships in the US over the past 30 years. Her parents and siblings in India are no longer alive, says Mr Ahluwalia.\n\n\"She has no-one, no home, no land to return to.\"\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube,Twitter and Facebook."

                "text": "An NYC high school devolved into a depraved den of deviants, according to city investigators, who found that one aide had sex with a student at least three times during lunch period, and are probing a second staffer for a similarly-twisted interaction with a pupil.\n\n\u201cCommunity associate\u201d Ocean Valentine, then 22, first approached a 17-year-old student at The Urban Assembly Early College High School of Emergency Medicine in Manhattan in May 2022, telling him she was active on Instagram, according to a newly-released report by the Special Commissioner of Investigation for the NYC schools.\n\nThe student found Valentine\u2019s Instagram profile, and the two began exchanging messages through the platform. Before long, though, she shared her phone number, and they started texting each other, investigators found.\n\nThe boy told investigators their text messages became sexual soon after she gave the teen her number, in late May or early June 2022, according to the SCI report.\n\nThe teen told investigators he had \u201cintercourse\u201d with the aide in his parents\u2019 apartment one afternoon during lunchtime after ducking out of the 297-student school on Pearl Street near NYPD headquarters.\n\n\u201cHe and Valentine left during lunch \u2014 while school was still in session \u2014 to engage in sexual intercourse. They walked across the street from the school to [the student\u2019s] apartment. After this initial encounter, [the student] recalled that twice more, they left during lunch period to have intercourse,\u201d the report says.\n\nOne of those other encounters was inside a private room at Sharks, a pool hall, where they had gone to celebrate the student\u2019s 18th birthday, investigators allege.\n\nThe misconduct came to light after a female classmate of the teen said she accidentally saw some of the texts on the boy\u2019s phone. She also said she saw a photo of a hotel receipt in one of the text messages.\n\nThe female student apparently blurted out something about \u201cstaff members \u2026 having sex with students\u201d within earshot of an official at the school. Soon after, the female student told the official which staffer he was referencing, the report says.\n\nAs investigators conducted their probe in early 2023 and were taking pictures of text messages on the student\u2019s phone, he received a message from Valentine, asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d the report says.\n\nTen days later, the teen told investigators Valentine was trying to contact him. He provided screenshots of his missed calls, which showed two calls at 10:07 pm and 10:08 pm from \u201cOcean.\u201d\n\nInvestigators confirmed the calls after obtaining Valentine\u2019s phone records. A search found 34 contacts between Valentine and [the student], including six calls after 7:00 pm and six on weekends.\n\nValentine was suspended without pay. She had a city salary of $34,415 in 2023, but took home $15,250 before her dismissal by the city Department of Education.\n\nIn another case at the school, The Post confirmed that a male aide is also the subject of an ongoing SCI probe for alleged sexual contract with a female pupil who also accused the aide of stealing $5,000 from her.\n\nNo other details were available, as the final report is pending.\n\nIn Valentine\u2019s case, SCI Anastasia Coleman recommended an update to the DOE\u2019s social media policy to bar employees from contacting students on such accounts and on personal cell phones.\n\nColeman has made this recommendation dozens of times in recent years, but the DOE has yet to amend the policy.\n\nValentine could not be reached for comment. The DOE did not return a request for comment."

I felt like Baz was ready to go. We\u2019ll get some stuff done (Saturday), and I\u2019ll know more.

As always, even though it is not supposed to, politics played a crucial role.\n\nSomeone at the palace very smartly put future Queen Kate Middleton next to Trump for Thursday\u2019s state dinner.\n\n\u201cKate delivered that fairy tale princess moment again, which I think everyone needs and craves and Donald Trump wanted,\u201d said Bethan Holt, author of \u201cThe Duchess of Cambridge: A Decade of Modern Royal Style.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was seated next to Trump. And when he gave his speech, he kept talking about the queen \u2014 and kept looking at Kate \u2026 For Donald Trump, Kate is already queen!\u201d\n\nIndeed, after praising King Charles as \u201ca very, very special man\u201d and then referencing \u201ca very, very special queen,\u201d the president turned to look at Kate before spotting the actual queen, Camilla.\n\nIt was also interesting, Holt pointed out, that Kate wore a regal, burgundy-hued suit to greet the president, followed by a stunning gold opera coat by Brit designer Phillipa Lepley \u2014 teamed with her favorite diamond-and-pearl crown, the Lover\u2019s Knot Tiara \u2014 for the dinner.\n\n\u201cTrump usually wears a red tie,\u201d Holt, fashion director at the UK Daily Telegraph, said. \u201cRed is obviously the big MAGA color, and he loves gold. It felt like a very calculated decision to wear gold.\u201d\n\nAs a point of protocol, the Prince and Princess of Wales, both 43, were the first to greet the president, 79, and First Lady Melania Trump 55, as the Americans\u2019 helicopter landed on the grounds of Windsor Castle Wednesday.\n\nPrince William, the heir to the throne, winkingly introduced the king with \u201cThis is my dad,\u201d before the monarch joined the president in the Irish carriage for a procession to the castle.\n\nAnd in a move that showed that the Waleses are getting ready for their own future on the throne, the younger couple had a private meeting with the Trumps that was described by palace sources as \u201cwarm and friendly\u201d.\n\nEven though Kate and Melania Trump were dubbed \u201cThe First Ladies\u201d on the front of the UK\u2019s The Sun \u2014 leaving Camilla in the shade \u2014 the princess is careful to attempt not to overshadow the senior royal, Holt said.\n\nIn one very public moment on Wednesday, Camilla appeared to shoo Kate away as she spoke to Melania.\n\n\u201cKate\u2019s gold dress was a real moment on social media,\u201d said Holt, \u201cBut in the room [St George\u2019s Hall], it almost blended into the walls, it was very clever in terms of toeing the line and not taking attention away from Camila.\u201d\n\nThe two women were, however, \u201csynchronized in that very traditional way\u201d when they wore the colors of the British flag \u2014 with Kate in her red-hued outfit and Camila in blue, when they greeted their American guests/\n\n\u201cKate wants to be respectful while, the reality is, her look and fashion choices are going to garner more attention than Camila,\u201d said Holt.\n\nHistorically, Camilla has never tried to be a fashion plate, so there is aways that slight imbalance of optics.\n\n\u201cKate will always steal the limelight. She looks the part in the way the world really expects a royal woman to look.\u201d\n\nHugo Vickers, author and friend of the royal family, told The Post that the visit came off exactly as the palace hoped: showing that the royal family, which has been besieged by health setbacks over the past year and a half, still knows how to \u201cpull out all the stops\u201d \u2014 and also securing William and Kate\u2019s future in the world order.\n\n\u201cI think there is absolutely no question the whole thing was a tremendous success, certainly on the royal side. It all worked seamlessly,\u201d Vickers said.\n\nHe noted that courtiers arranged for \u201clots of extra things,\u201d including setting up a procession of carriages.\n\nAs we revealed, the special relationship will also get a boost next year, as the British Foreign Office is planning to ask William and Kate to jet over to join America\u2019s 250th birthday celebrations, and depending on his health, Charles may join too.\n\nTrump was first hosted in the UK by the late Queen Elizabeth II in 2019 during his first term in office.\n\nTraditionally, second-term presidents are not offered a state visit and have instead been invited for tea or lunch with the monarch.\n\nIn a lavish tribute to king and country at the state dinner, Trump said the word \u201cspecial\u201d does not \u201cbegin to do \u2026 justice\u201d to the relationship between America and Britain, whose bonds are \u201cpriceless and eternal.\u201d\n\nThe president delivered a heartfelt personal tribute to the King, saying he \u201cepitomized the fortitude, nobility and the spirit of the British monarchy and the British people.\u201d\n\nPrince William, he added, was \u201cremarkable\u201d and he called Kate \u2014 whose cancer is now in remission \u2014 \u201cso radiant, so healthy and so beautiful.\u201d\n\nVickers noted of the state dinner, \u201cthe whole point is for the king to be as hospitable as possible. When Ronald Reagan came over, [Queen Elizabeth] was told that he liked having a shower \u2014 so she had a shower installed in his suite especially.\u201d\n\nAnd the families may even have coordinated on sending a stylistic message.\n\nHolt noted that Melania donned an off-the-shoulder yellow gown by Carolina Herrera at the dinner while Queen Camilla wore blue \u2014 walking together, they appeared to represent the colors of the Ukrainian flag.\n\nMeanwhile, Charles voiced support for Ukraine during the state dinner, saying, \u201cToday, as tyranny once again threatens Europe, we and our allies stand together in support of Ukraine, to deter aggression and secure peace.\u201d\n\nNodding along to the speech, Trump looked particularly tickled by the King\u2019s reference to British soil making for \u201crather splendid golf courses.\u201d\n\nAs always, it\u2019s almost impossible to now see the royal family in action without thinking of who is missing: Prince Harry.\n\nTrump has accused the estranged royal of being \u201cwhipped\u201d by his wife, Meghan Markle, who has made it clear she is no fan of the president\u2019s \u2014 including during his 2016 campaign, when she described him as \u201cmisogynistic\u201d and \u201cdivisive.\u201d\n\nHowever, Trump previously told The Post he would not throw Harry out of the US over alleged visa issues.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d he said in February. \u201cI\u2019ll leave him alone. He\u2019s got enough problems with his wife. She\u2019s terrible.\u201d\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, Kate hosted Melania for a Scouts event on Thursday at Harry and Markle\u2019s former Windsor home, Frogmore Cottage which Charles made them leave. \u201cShady!\u201d one palace wag told Page Six.\n\nThe state visit came just days after Harry was reunited with the king for the first time in 19 months, as they shared a private tea at Clarence House.\n\nThe renegade royal said his dad, who announced his cancer diagnosis in February 2024, was \u201cdoing great.\u201d Harry also hopes to be able to bring Markle and their kids, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, back to the UK. But he has been refused official security by the British Foreign Office while visiting, leading to something of a standoff.\n\nWhile making a surprise visit to Kyiv, Ukraine, Harry last week told The Guardian that over the coming year, \u201cthe focus really has to be on my dad.\u201d\n\nSources told us that Harry was thrilled by the meeting and wants to focus on reconciliation above all else \u2014 although he is still estranged from his older brother William after their fallout over Markle and, as alleged in Harry\u2019s \u201cSpare\u201d memoir, a physical altercation.\n\nAnd Trump made no mention of Harry in his state dinner speech \u2014 although royal sources said it would have been \u201cdeeply inappropriate\u201d for him to mention the king\u2019s younger son.\n\nInstead, Trump said, \u201cI just want to say that His Majesty has also raised a remarkable son in His Royal Highness, Prince of Wales. Really amazing. We\u2019ve gotten to know you and I think you\u2019re going to have unbelievable success in the future.\u201d"

                "summary": "During his state visit to the UK, Donald Trump expressed greater enthusiasm for being hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle than for his discussions with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers. While the two leaders maintained a warm relationship and navigated potential disagreements amicably during their joint news conference, Trump's long-standing positions on key issues remain unchanged. Ultimately, the visit reinforced the UK\u2019s ability to engage diplomatically with the US, allowing Starmer to disagree respectfully without incurring penalties.",
                "source": "BBC",
                "text": "2 days ago\n\nSarah SmithNorth America editor\n\nThere is little doubt that Donald Trump was more enthused about the day he spent at Windsor Castle than his talks with Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers.\n\nAnd that is no slight on the UK prime minister's hospitality during this state visit, which Trump and his team have been eager to praise.\n\nStarmer's country residence is undoubtedly an impressive meeting place, and there was even an aerial display by the British Army's Red Devils who flew enormous British and American flags to welcome the US leader to the Buckinghamshire countryside.\n\nBut as much as Trump appears to genuinely like Starmer, with their warm relationship on display at a joint news conference on Thursday, the president was totally beguiled by being hosted by the King and Queen on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, his definitive highlight of the trip was the elaborate evening banquet for 160 guests in Windsor Castle's St George's Hall that evening.\n\nFor Trump, who has a deep and longstanding admiration for the Royals, it is hard to compete with being toasted by the King. No matter how many jets are laid on for you in the skies above Chequers.\n\nState visits like these allow presidents and prime ministers to connect with one other on a more personal level, and offer a chance for their respective staff to build working relationships. They are also an opportunity to demonstrate the closeness of relations on a big stage.\n\nIn this sense, it was smooth sailing for both sides.\n\nKey takeaways from Trump-Starmer news conference\n\nTrump suggests Starmer could use military to control UK borders\n\nIn pictures: Trump and Melania meet royals at Windsor\n\nThere was no real awkwardness during the joint news conference, which had the potential to expose areas of disagreements.\n\nWhen the two men were asked about one of those issues, the UK's plan to recognise Palestinian statehood, Trump said he disagreed but also gave Starmer a big smile and a warm slap on the back as the prime minister condemned Hamas.\n\nAnd on another potentially tricky topic, the sacking of Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, Trump was unusually taciturn. He said very little and immediately deferred to Starmer.\n\nThe two leaders did discuss Gaza and Ukraine when they spent almost an hour talking alone without any of their staff in the room. And while they were very amicable during the news conference, it also quickly became clear that neither had changed their positions on the key issues where they disagree.\n\nThere are limits to how much influence any leader can have on Trump, regardless of the success of a trip such as this.\n\nInside Chequers, I asked Wiles, the president's chief-of-staff, how much difference the visit will make to Britain's ability to influence US policy on trade, tariffs and international affairs. Her response was frank \u2013 none at all.\n\nHowever much Trump enjoyed this state visit, he is not going to alter his positions on important global matters because of a memorable night spent at Windsor Castle.\n\nBut after all the pomp and pageantry, Starmer appears to have at least earned the right to respectfully disagree with Trump without paying a diplomatic penalty.\n\nIt can be costly to get on the wrong side of the US president, but by carefully navigating the relationship the UK has managed to avoid the punishingly high trade tariffs that have been imposed on other nations. Starmer, meanwhile, has not been subjected to a humiliating dressing down or given a derogatory nickname.\n\nWhile this was never going to descend into the kind of awkward clash we've seen at times in the Oval Office this year - not just with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky but with other leaders too - it is notable that a more relaxed Trump approached the questions during the concluding news conference in a far less combative way than he often does back in Washington.\n\nDid the UK prime minister play his \"trump\" card by arranging this lavish state visit? It was choreographed flawlessly and clearly delighted Trump and the first lady.\n\nAnd while Starmer may not have won the ability to change the president's mind, a falling out now feels further away than ever before."

Police found a blood-stained hammer with the brand name Great Neck in their room at the spa under the bed.\n\nA native of Tajikistan, Rosas came to NYC in 2009 at age 17. She married a Queens man, but was separated from him when she started dating Gannon in 2021, the New York Times reported. She and Gannon traveled together, staying in upscale hotels.

But what has made Norma a nationwide obsession is the fact that it's based on a viral true story.\n\nIn 2022, Norma Risma, a woman in Serang City on Indonesia's Java island, exposed her husband and mother's affair in a TikTok video.\n\nHer story quickly racked up millions of views, made headlines and ultimately brought her a movie deal that has taken South East Asia by storm.\n\nNorma, which hit Indonesian theatres in March and Netflix in August, soon became one of the most watched movies, not just in Indonesia but also Malaysia and Singapore, where there are large Malay-Muslim populations.\n\nIt also follows a winning formula that Indonesian filmmakers have discovered: adapting viral social media scandals.\n\nUntil this June, Indonesia's highest-grossing film of all time was KKN di Desa Penari, a 2022 horror story about the haunting of six university students, which came from a popular thread on X. In 2023 came Sewu Dino, another horror flick adapted from a story shared by the same X account.\n\nEqually popular are tales of a more salacious persuasion: Ipar Adalah Maut, a 2024 Indonesian movie about an affair between a man and his sister-in-law, was marketed as a true story adapted from a TikTok video. The 2022 drama series Layangan Putus, about a family torn apart by a cheating husband, also got its inspiration from TikTok.\n\nSuch themes are highly taboo in Indonesia, where adultery is punishable with jail time. The country's new criminal code, set to take effect nationwide next year, outlaws sex outside marriage - and in its most conservative province, couples are already publicly flogged for premarital sex.\n\nBut in this culture of religious conservatism, experts say, a voyeuristic interest in household scandals thrives.\n\nWith the help of social media, stories that had mostly been limited to neighbourhood gossip now make for viral \"pelakor\" content, a slang term for homewrecker and an oft-used keyword in videos of wives confronting their husbands' mistresses.\n\n\"With films about these scandals, people are given a space to peek into someone else's household problems,\" SM Gietty Tambunan, a member of the Jakarta Arts Council Film Committee, tells BBC Indonesian.\n\n\"Especially because of that conservative culture, people are becoming even more curious.\"\n\nA taste for scandal\n\nVero, a 42-year-old housewife in Jakarta, has been following Norma's story since it went viral on TikTok. It made her \"furious with the husband and mother\", she tells BBC Indonesian.\n\n\"When I knew this story was being made into a movie, I wanted to see how cruel these two people were to Norma,\" she says.\n\nIn the cinema she cried at the movie's climax, when Norma weaved through a crowd outside her house to find her half-dressed husband and mother in the room.\n\nThe tender scenes of Norma's husband and mother resisting and then realising their romance has both scandalised and captured viewers.\n\n\"Surely after filming this they will feel sick,\" a TikTok user commented on a scene where the pair kissed. In the film, a friend who discovers the pair's illicit relationship vomits when she catches them in the act.\n\nMs Gietty warns that these narratives have a dangerous tendency to put the blame mostly on women rather than the cheating men. In these feuds between the legitimate spouse and the illicit lover, \"the man tends not to receive any punishment,\" she says.\n\nBut what sets the film Norma apart is the involvement of the protagonist herself in the creative process, the film's screenwriter Oka Aurora tells BBC Indonesian. She is also behind the script for Ipar Adalah Maut and Layangan Putus, the two other TikTok-inspired productions.\n\nAfter intense discussions with Norma about her feelings and her mother's backstory, the film's \"core story remains broadly consistent\", says Oka, though she added that there were \"definitely certain parts that were dramatised to play with the audience's emotions\".\n\n\"This film is also a way for people to release emotions and have fun. So when they leave the cinema, there are things they feel and talk about.\"\n\nLife for Norma\n\nToday, the real Norma works as an outsourced worker in Serang, her hometown.\n\nHer mother, Rihanah, has returned home to live with the family after an eight-month prison stint for adultery. Rozy, Norma's ex-husband, was sentenced to nine months in jail.\n\nDuring a press appearance for the film in February, Norma said she was encouraged by the messages she had received from other victims of cheating spouses.\n\n\"When I experienced [the affair], I thought, 'Why am I being cheated on by the person closest to me? Am I the only one experiencing this?' It turns out that when I spoke up, many people had experienced the same thing,\" said Norma."

In a statement, the UK government acknowledged the ruling and promised to cooperate with Kenyan authorities in the case.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Wanjiru\u2019s family said on Tuesday they had waited \u201ctoo long\u201d for justice but hoped that it would now arrive, according to reporting by The Associated Press (AP) news agency.\n\n\u201cWhile this is progress, it is not justice yet,\u201d family spokesperson Esther Muchiri said.\n\nWhat happened to Agnes Wanjiru?\n\nTwenty-one-year-old Wanjiru worked as a hairdresser and a sex worker in Nanyuki, her hometown.\n\nOn the night of March 31, Wanjiru disappeared. Witnesses said she was last seen in the company of British soldiers on a night out at the Lion\u2019s Court Lodge. The hotel is popular with British soldiers of the British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK), a permanent garrison in Nanyuki.\n\nTwo months later, on June 5, Wanjiru\u2019s body was found in a septic tank located close to the hotel.\n\nShe had been beaten, stabbed, and was most likely still alive when she was thrown into the septic tank, a Kenyan magistrate said in a 2019 inquest. Wanjiru\u2019s daughter, who was just a few months old, is now 13 and is being raised by her grandmother and an aunt.\n\nThe allegations against a British soldier came to light in 2021 when a Sunday Times investigation revealed that \u201cSoldier X\u201d, whom Wanjiru was last seen with, was believed to have stabbed her in the chest and abdomen. The soldier revealed his actions to colleagues and showed them where he dumped her body. At least one of them reported this to senior commanders at BATUK. It\u2019s unclear if any action was taken.\n\nThe Sunday Times\u2019 investigation revealed \u201cSoldier X\u201d and several others further poked fun at the murdered woman in Facebook posts.\n\nAttempts by her family to sue BATUK in Kenya were initially met with resistance because the British government, under the former ruling Conservative Party, claimed Kenyan courts did not have jurisdiction over UK troops. Following the Sunday Times expos\u00e9, however, the British government\u2019s stance changed.\n\nA UK parliament vote in April 2023 amended security agreements between the two countries to allow for British troops to be tried locally in Kenya. In August 2023, the Kenyan government officially launched an inquiry into Wanjiru\u2019s killing. Kenyan investigators are understood to have travelled several times to the UK since then to speak to witnesses.\n\nWhat did the court say?\n\nNairobi High Court Justice Alexander Muteti on Tuesday said there was \u201cprobable cause to order the arrest of the accused\u201d and issued a warrant for \u201cone citizen and resident of the United Kingdom\u201d.\n\nThe court did not name the suspect, a move that family members of the late woman questioned.\n\nKenya\u2019s office for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) said in a statement on X that \u201cextradition proceedings would now be initiated to ensure the suspect is brought before a Kenyan court\u201d.\n\n\u201cToday, the DPP informed the High Court that evidence gathered links the suspect, a United Kingdom citizen, to the murder,\u201d the statement read, adding that the extradition proceedings will be initiated.\n\nThe case will next be heard in court on October 21, 2025, the DPP said.\n\nWhat is BATUK?\n\nThe British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) is a permanent training support force based on the outskirts of Nanyuki that has been operating since Kenya gained independence in 1963. Thousands of British infantrymen have passed through the BATUK training camp for exercises in harsh terrain.\n\nThe unit has some 100 permanent staff and about 280 rotating short-term regiments from the UK. British troops train there as well as Kenyan troops who are part of antiterrorism squads focused on the armed group al-Shabab in neighbouring Somalia.\n\nWhile the British soldiers\u2019 presence has bolstered the local economy, there have been complaints about their conduct towards local people and the way they treat the local environment. Residents of Nanyuki complain of unexploded bombs that have detonated and maimed community members, and the presence of white phosphorus, a lethal chemical, left behind after training exercises. In one case in 2021, the chemical is believed to have started a large fire that damaged swaths of forest land.\n\nAllegations that the soldiers pay local women for sex are rife. In July 2022, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence banned soldiers from using sex workers abroad as part of efforts to curb sexual exploitation and abuse. In an August 2024 report conducted by the British army into activities at BATUK, however, officials found that soldiers there were still using sex workers at a \u201clow or moderate level\u201d.\n\nWhat has the UK government said?\n\nThe British High Commission in Kenya reiterated earlier commitments that it would cooperate with Kenyan authorities on the case, but did not confirm or deny that an extradition request for the suspect had been issued, according to the AP.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, a spokesperson for the UK government, reacting to the ruling, said: \u201cOur thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru and we remain absolutely committed to helping them secure justice.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added: \u201cWe understand that the Kenyan director of public prosecutions has determined that a British national should face trial in relation to the murder of Ms Wanjiru in 2012.\n\n\u201cThis is subject to ongoing legal proceedings, and we will not comment further at this stage.\u201d\n\nIn April this year, UK Secretary of Defence John Healey met with Wanjiru\u2019s family and promised to help the family get \u201cthe justice they deserve\u201d."

It would only apply to new requests, but companies would have to pay the same amount for each applicant for six years, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.\n\n\"The company needs to decide... is the person valuable enough to have a $100,000-a-year payment to the government, or they should head home, and they should go hire an American,\" he said, adding: \"All of the big companies are on board.\"\n\nSince 2004, the number of H-1B applications has been capped at 85,000 per year.\n\nUntil now, H-1B visas have carried various administrative fees totalling around $1,500.\n\nData from US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) shows that applications for H-1B visas for the next fiscal year fell to about 359,000 - a four-year low.\n\nThe greatest beneficiary of the programme the previous fiscal year was Amazon, followed by tech giants Tata, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google, according to government statistics.\n\nLate on Friday, Amazon told employees with H-1B visas who were already in the US to remain there.\n\nAccording to an internal advisory, seen by Business Insider, the company said those abroad should \"try to return before tomorrow's deadline if possible\".\n\nAnyone unable to make it back before the order takes effect should avoid attempting US re-entry \"until further guidance is provided\", the company is also quoted as saying.\n\nMeanwhile, India's leading trade body Nasscom said it was concerned by the edict - and that the one-day deadline created \"considerable uncertainty for businesses, professionals, and students across the world\".\n\nIndia was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71% of approved applications, Reuters news agency reports, citing government data.\n\nChina was said to come in second at 11.7%.\n\nTahmina Watson, a founding attorney at Watson Immigration Law, told the BBC that the ruling could be a \"nail in the coffin\" for many of her clients that are mostly small businesses and start-ups.\n\n\"Almost everyone's going to be priced out. This $100,000 as an entry point is going to have a devastating impact,\" she added, noting that many small or medium-sized companies \"will tell you they actually can't find workers to do the job\".\n\n\"When employers sponsor foreign talent, more often than not, they're doing that because they have not been able to fulfil those positions,\" Ms Watson added.\n\nJorge Lopez, the chair of the immigration and global mobility practice group at Littler Mendelson PC, said a $100,000 fee \"will put the brakes on American competitiveness in the tech sector and all industries\".\n\nSome companies might consider setting up operations outside the US, though doing so can be challenging in practice, he added.\n\nThe debate over H-1Bs had previously caused splits within Trump's team and supporters, pitting those in favour of the visas against critics such as former strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nTrump told reporters at the White House in January that he understands \"both sides of the argument\" on H-1Bs.\n\nThe year before - while seeking to attract support from the tech industry while on the campaign trail - Trump vowed to make the process of attracting talent easier, going as far as to propose green cards for college graduates.\n\n\"You need a pool of people to work for companies,\" he told the All-In Podcast. \"You have to be able to recruit these people and keep these people.\"\n\nEarly in his first term in 2017, Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B applications, seeking to improve fraud detection.\n\nRejections rose to an all-time high of 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared to between 5% and 8% under Barack Obama and then between 2% and 4% under Joe Biden.\n\nAt the time, tech companies pushed back, criticising the Trump administration's H-1B order."

Train Americans. Stop bringing in people to take our jobs,\u201d US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.\n\nHowever, such a prohibitive fee will likely vastly transform the H-1B system, which was created in 1990 and awards 85,000 visas per year on a lottery system.\n\nThe programme has come under increased scrutiny from the Trump administration amid a wider crackdown on immigration, which the US president has tied to boosting domestic labour.\n\nAs part of that campaign, the Trump administration has also sought to introduce more restrictive policies on international students studying in the US, including requiring access to social media accounts and a ban on foreign travellers from several countries.\n\n\u2018Taxing away innovation edge\u2019\n\nThe Trump administration has previously considered changing the H-1B visa rules to favour higher-paying employers, essentially doing away with the lottery system.\n\nSupporters of the H-1B programme say it brings the best and brightest to work in the US, creating an edge against foreign competitors. Critics have long charged that companies have abused the programme, using it to pay lower wages and to impose fewer labour protections.\n\nLutnick said on Friday that \u201call the big companies are on board\u201d with $100,000 a year for H-1B visas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the visa would cost $100,000 a year for each of the three years of its duration, but that the details were \u201cstill being considered\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s move could add millions of dollars in costs for companies, which could hit smaller tech firms and start-ups particularly hard.\n\nAdding new fees \u201ccreates disincentive to attract the world\u2019s smartest talent to the US\u201d, said Deedy Das, partner at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, on X. \u201cIf the US ceases to attract the best talent, it drastically reduces its ability to innovate and grow the economy.\u201d\n\nSome analysts suggested the fee may force companies to move some high-value work overseas, hampering the US\u2019s position in the high-stakes artificial intelligence race with China.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, Washington may collect a windfall; in the long term, the US risks taxing away its innovation edge, trading dynamism for short-sighted protectionism,\u201d said eMarketer analyst Jeremy Goldman.\n\nOthers questioned the legality of the new fees.\n\n\u201cCongress has only authorized the government to set fees to recover the cost of adjudicating an application,\u201d Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director of the American Immigration Council, wrote on Blue Sky.\n\nUnder the current system, entering the lottery for the visa requires a small fee and, if approved, subsequent fees could amount to several thousand dollars.\n\nThis year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas, with more than 10,000 awarded. The company was followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.\n\nGeographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nMeanwhile, India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 percent of approved beneficiaries. China was a distant second at 11.7 percent, according to government data.\n\nThe H-1B visas are approved for a period of three to six years."

Johnson is also directing his colleagues to focus on changes to the full-year fiscal 2026 legislative branch spending bill, which is in the thick of bipartisan and bicameral negotiations and will be the vehicle for additional security investments.\n\nLast minute headaches aside, this House-passed bill marks the second time this year that Republicans have managed to pass government funding legislation without needing any Democratic support. It also marks the continuation of a major shift for the House GOP Conference, where fiscal conservatives who rarely vote for spending bills signed on, saving Republicans from needing Democratic support to bail them out.\n\nEven more striking was the unity among those conservatives advocating for a continuing resolution, which has for many years been anathema to House hard-liners like those in the Freedom Caucus. But these fiscal hawks banked on the stopgap solution being a more conservative deal than a bipartisan negotiated funding patch.

Still, it comes amid concerns the agency is moving away from scientifically supported vaccine policy under the leadership of Kennedy, who critics say has spread vaccine scepticism rooted in misinformation.\n\nSpeaking to a Senate Committee earlier this week, fired CDC Director Susan Monarez warned of increased politicalisation and a backslide in scientific rigour at the agency under Kennedy.\n\nMonarez has alleged she was fired for failing to agree to greenlight any recommendations from ACIP, regardless of the scientific justification.

People remain at risk of infection even after contracting the virus once, because it continues to evolve.\n\nCDC data released in June shows the virus resulted in 32,000 to 51,000 US deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalisations last fall and winter. Most at risk for hospitalisation are unvaccinated seniors and young children.\n\nDuring the meeting, ACIP focused on concerns over a rare side-effect of the vaccine, a heart inflammation known as myocarditis, that has occurred in mostly younger men.\n\nA scientist studying whether people with certain genes are uniquely susceptible told the panel the Trump administration had cancelled his grant before the research could be finished.\n\nMuch of the panel\u2019s scepticism has focused on mRNA vaccines, an emerging technology key to the fast rollout of COVID vaccines amid the pandemic.\n\nKennedy has repeatedly suggested such vaccines pose more threats than benefits, a position rejected by nearly all leading medical organisations.\n\nHe announced in August that he was moving to cancel $500m in mRNA vaccine research."

                "text": "NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s second-term agenda is a bold roadmap for American renewal, aggressively implementing conservative ideas to drive economic growth and energy self-sufficiency. It\u2019s squarely focused on delivering for what Trump terms the \"forgotten Americans\" \u2014 the working men and women whose interests have long been ignored by elites from both political parties. This agenda is exactly what Trump ran on last year. Yet today, a group of Democrat trial lawyers are trying to short-circuit Trump on issue after issue \u2014 working to achieve through lawfare what they failed to at the ballot box.\n\nTRUMP FACES MULTIPLE LEGAL SETBACKS AS FEDERAL COURTS QUESTION BROAD PRESIDENTIAL POWERS\n\nWeaponizing the law against political opponents \u2014 known as lawfare \u2014 is most commonly associated with the actions of the FBI against President Trump during the Obama and Biden years. We now see this playbook being used by activist attorneys to systematically block key elements of the Trump agenda from being enacted \u2013 all while collecting big legal fees.\n\nMost recently, lawfare has come for an executive order Trump signed in August that aims to democratize access to alternative assets in 401(k) plans. The EO aims to allow the 90 million-plus everyday Americans who save for retirement through traditional 401(k) plans to invest in assets typically reserved for the wealthy and well-connected - namely, private equity and cryptocurrencies. These investments have regularly outperformed the public stock market and help diversify investors\u2019 portfolios, which many believe are too heavily exposed to the \"Magnificent 7\" Big Tech stocks. This is why major investors like large state pension funds tend to hold around one-third of their assets in private market investments.\n\nThe order directs the Department of Labor (DOL) to reexamine fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and propose rules that could include a legal safe harbor for plan sponsors choosing to include high-quality alternative investment options. A few days later, the DOL rescinded Biden-era language that had discouraged such options, opening the door for American savers to these asset classes, which are typically limited to so-called \"accredited investors,\" with high income and net worth.\n\nYet trial lawyers are already plotting lawsuits to cancel this reform before it can start, and aim to win a big payday in doing so. As a prominent plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer stated recently to Bloomberg Law: \"I would joke and say that I hope employers add alternative investments, because I have some kids I need to put through college.\" Indeed, unless the Trump administration insists on strong rulemaking and clear safe harbor in place, these lawyers plan to use the court system to extract multimillion dollar settlements that benefit themselves, while denying average Americans the wealth-building tools that have long been reserved for the elite.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nOn energy, President Trump made a decisive move with his executive order unleashing American energy, encouraging exploration on federal lands, eliminating burdensome electric vehicle mandates, revoking outdated climate-related directives, and streamlining permitting processes. Yet, environmental trial lawyers have mounted a fierce counteroffensive, using lawfare to hold up these vital changes, resulting in delays that keep energy prices higher, stifle job growth in America\u2019s heartland, and prolong reliance on America\u2019s adversaries for energy resources.\n\nThe pattern continues with Trump\u2019s drive for a smaller, more efficient federal workforce. In March, he signed an executive order to address workforce efficiency, instructing agencies to terminate collective bargaining agreements - some of which were signed in the final days of the Biden Administration to hamstring President Trump. Labor union lawyers have deployed lawfare to preserve the entrenched system and challenge the order in multiple federal courts, securing court stays. Their efforts delay essential efficiencies, perpetuating a bloated federal workforce that drains taxpayer dollars and slows government responsiveness.\n\nThis well-coordinated effort shows the threat to Trump\u2019s agenda from those trying using the courts to override the will of the American voter. These trial lawyers, motivated by both ideology and profit, seek to accomplish through the courts what they couldn\u2019t in the 2024 election: Stop Trump at any cost. Our movement\u2019s challenge is to fight back, reclaiming policy-making from the courts and restore it to the people\u2019s representatives."

Despite veterinary efforts, the 29-year-old male died within 40 minutes, officials said.\n\nFor 24 years, Shankar endured a lonely existence - including at least 13 spent in solitary confinement.\n\nThe cause of his death is not known yet. \"Investigation regarding the cause of death has been ordered,\" zoo director Sanjeet Kumar told BBC.\n\nShankar was among two African elephants that arrived in India in 1998 as a diplomatic gift from Zimbabwe to former India President Shankar Dayal Sharma.\n\nBut Shankar's companion died in 2001, said Mr Kumar.\n\nA former zoo official, who did not wish to be identified, said that after his companion's death, Shankar was temporarily lodged with the Asian elephants in the zoo, but the plan did not work.\n\n\"They were very aggressive towards one another,\" he said, adding that Shankar was soon isolated.\n\n\"He [Shankar] was playful when his companion was there. They were popular among zoo visitors. Shankar's behaviour changed after the other African elephant died. Shankar never accepted any other elephant's company, neither did they accept Shankar's. He was left friendless,\" the former official said.\n\nIn 2012, Shankar was shifted to a new enclosure that left him virtually in solitary confinement - despite a 2009 federal ban on keeping elephants alone for more than six months. He remained there until his death.\n\nFor years now, activists have been demanding that Shankar be removed from the zoo and rehabilitated in a wildlife sanctuary that houses other African elephants.\n\nIn 2021, a petition in Delhi's high court sought Shankar's relocation to a sanctuary with other African elephants. Two years later, the court dismissed the petition, directing the petitioner to approach the committee handling transfers of wild animals by zoos.\n\nUntil Wednesday, Shankar was among the only two African elephants in India's zoos. The other - also an adult male - lives in Mysore zoo in the southern state of Karnataka.\n\nZoos have long struggled to find mates for the two African male elephants, with efforts stalled by high costs, regulatory hurdles, multiple approvals, and welfare concerns, The Indian Express reported.\n\nActivists have also criticised the conditions in which Shankar was kept at the zoo in Delhi, describing his enclosure as bleak and inadequate.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking to see him die like this,\" said Nikita Dhawan, founder of the non-profit Youth For Animals, who had filed the 2021 court petition. \"It was easily preventable. He (Shankar) did not have any serious health problems. And he was too young.\"\n\nThe average life expectancy of African elephants is 70 years.\n\nMr Kumar, the director of Delhi zoo, said that there was \"no report of sickness or abnormal behaviour\" in Shankar's case till Wednesday morning.\n\nAnimal welfare activist Gauri Maulekhi said Shankar's death reflects \"years of institutional apathy and neglect\" and called it a systemic failure demanding accountability.\n\n\"An internal inquiry is simply not enough,\" Ms Maulekhi told BBC. \"This was a systemic failure that demands real accountability and must serve as a watershed moment to end the cruel practice of keeping elephants and other social animals isolated in our zoos for good.\"\n\nAsked about allegations of neglect, Mr Kumar said \"all care and upkeep was followed\", but declined to take specific questions.\n\nIn October 2024, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, suspended the Delhi zoo's membership over concerns about Shankar's living conditions, following reports that he was chained, news agency PTI reported.\n\nThe global body gave Delhi zoo until April 2025 to either relocate Shankar or improve his care, warning that its membership would be terminated if the deadline was missed.\n\nA day after the suspension notice, a federal minister inspected Shankar's enclosure and said his health looked better. On 15 October, the government announced plans to bring him a female companion, saying Zimbabwe and Botswana had shown interest and formalities were underway.\n\nOfficials in Delhi zoo said that they did not receive any more notices from the global body. And Shankar died before a companion could be arranged.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube,Twitter and Facebook."

Despite this, neither major political party has aggressively pursued the issue, which could provide them with an electoral advantage in swing states.",

                "text": "NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nA few hours before he was assassinated, Charlie Kirk\u2019s last batch of Facebook posts included a critique of a Wall Street Journal article concerning the growing national effects of Kentucky\u2019s landmark child custody law, which has a rebuttable presumption that assumes equal parenting time is in a child\u2019s best interest.\n\nThe WSJ article noted the falling divorce rate in the Bluegrass State because of the historic law and how four more states have passed similar laws. However, there\u2019s another compelling reason for both parties to push for shared parenting: Voters want it and evidence shows it affects how they vote. And the more vocal political candidates are about supporting equal parenting time custody, the more votes they get.\n\nNY TIMES COLUMNIST DEFENDS BELIEF THAT CHARLIE KIRK PRACTICED POLITICS 'THE RIGHT WAY' AFTER LIBERAL BACKLASH\n\nAfter Kentucky\u2019s shared parenting law roared into life, the soon-to-follow fall election showed a direct correlation between winning percentage of contested races and lawmakers\u2019 support of the bill. Of the contested House races, 100% of the sponsors won, 90% of those who voted \u2018yes\u2019 won, 80% of those who did not vote won and none of those who voted \u2018no\u2019 won. In fact, every bill sponsor who ran again won despite 14 seats changing parties.\n\nThe Republicans and Democrats should not be surprised by this because the voters are constantly telling them they support shared parenting. It\u2019s not just in Kentucky, either. National Parents Organization has commissioned independent polling in 29 states and shared parenting has massive support in EVERY state, red and blue alike. Not only do large majorities of both Republicans and Democrats support the legislation, but so do majorities of every demographic. It does not matter whether women, men, African Americans or Hispanics are polled. They all show majority support for shared parenting.\n\nKirk\u2019s post supporting equal custody laws subtly guided the parties to promote shared parenting because it makes voters more likely to vote for whichever party provides a pro-shared parenting candidate. Either party gaining a few extra voters in a swing state like North Carolina could sway an election. Further, Tar Heel State voters are telling the parties loud and clear how to get more votes: Pass shared parenting. An astonishing 94% said they are \"more likely to vote for a candidate who supports children spending equal or nearly equal time with each parent ...when both parents are fit and willing to be parents.\" Voters in crucial Pennsylvania are telling the parties the same thing at a 91% clip. In Wisconsin, the tipping point state in the 2016 presidential election, it\u2019s even higher, at 96%. In every swing state polled, candidates can gain a similar boost with Georgia\u2019s 94% and New Hampshire\u2019s 95% polled support.\n\nKEY SCOTUS PARENTAL RIGHTS CASES DRAW MCMAHON, MOMS FOR LIBERTY TO RALLY ON COURT STEPS\n\nIt's surprising that neither party has made a big push on the topic. First, shared parenting seems like an obvious Democrat issue. The Democrat national brand touts equality issues, and what\u2019s more equal than equal child custody time for both parents? The Democrats can promote shared parenting, and it will resonate with their base, which demands legal fairness for all groups. African Americans and LGBTQ individuals have much mistrust of the legal system, and many do not believe they can get a fair child custody hearing if the other parent is White and/or straight. Further, the liberal party has spent money studying how to make inroads with men. Well, only 13% of Kentuckians said the family courts would NOT be likely to give men less child custody time.\n\nSpeaking of men, aren\u2019t they supposed to be on the Republican\u2019s side of the gender gap? So, why isn\u2019t this an obvious GOP issue? Their base strength is with men, a group that not only supports shared parenting but feels they are not given fair treatment in court. Further, the Republicans want to make inroads with minorities groups. Minority men and women support equal parenting and that includes, of course, the crucial Hispanic swing vote.\n\nIn a closely divided nation, voters are telling the parties the same thing Charlie Kirk did: Support pro-equality family law. The Democrats or the Republicans can gain an edge in swing states and swing voting blocks by taking up an issue both of their bases want. Or, maybe I should say their current bases because this powerful issue gives either party a shot at eating into the other\u2019s base."

From factory-certified devices that meet stringent quality checks to third-party refurbishments that address only surface-level defects, the range is vast. My experience shows that treating refurbished items as \"like new\" is a mistake. Many come with cosmetic blemishes or partially worn components, and some sellers stop at a basic reset and cleaning.\n\nThe key is to scrutinize the seller's refurbishment process and request detailed specifications or photos to ensure the item is in good condition. Look for transparency about what has been repaired or replaced. A reputable refurbisher will disclose whether critical components such as screens, batteries or motherboards were replaced or simply tested.\n\nPro tip: Many refurbishers use a grading system (A, B, C). Grade A means near new, Grade B usually has light scratches, while Grade C shows heavier wear. Knowing the grade helps set realistic expectations.\n\n2) Check the warranty and return policy\n\nOne of the most overlooked yet critical aspects of buying refurbished electronics is the warranty and return policy. Through years of testing products, I've seen warranties vary wildly from generous 90-day coverage to none at all. A solid warranty is not just a formality; it's a reflection of the refurbisher's confidence in the quality of the product. Without it, you're taking a gamble.\n\nIndustry best practices suggest opting for sellers who provide at least a 90-day warranty and a clear, no-hassle return window. I have consistently seen reliable refurbishers like Amazon Renewed, eBay Certified Refurbished and Back Market stand by their work with transparent policies.\n\nAlso look at Apple Certified Refurbished and Dell Outlet, which are industry leaders for high-quality laptops, tablets and phones.\n\n3) Know the seller's reputation\n\nNot all sellers are equal when it comes to refurbished tech. My years covering consumer electronics have made it clear that choosing a reputable seller is more important than chasing the lowest price. Factory-certified refurbishers and authorized resellers tend to follow strict testing and quality control procedures. In contrast, independent sellers often vary in quality and reliability.\n\nI always emphasize researching the seller's history, reading verified customer reviews and ensuring they offer clear refurbishment guarantees. Established marketplaces and brand-certified stores provide additional layers of security, including dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\nRed flags include: vague warranty language, listings with only stock photos, \"open box\" items marketed as refurbished and any product sold \"as-is.\" If you see those, walk away.\n\n4) Don't forget accessories and packaging\n\nA less obvious but important consideration is the state of accessories and packaging. In industry practice, refurbished products rarely arrive in original packaging or with the full set of accessories. I've seen that some sellers ship devices with generic boxes and subpar third-party accessories or omit chargers and manuals altogether.\n\nIf accessories are important to your workflow, don't assume they'll be included. Always verify the listing description and, when in doubt, ask the seller directly. Knowing exactly what comes in the box prevents surprises and ensures you don't have to hunt for compatible chargers or cables after the fact, potentially eroding any savings you initially gained.\n\n5) Battery life may not be the same\n\nA common misconception is that refurbished devices come with batteries that perform like new, but that's not the case. Batteries naturally degrade with use, and not all refurbishers replace them.\n\nSome sellers disclose battery replacement while others do not. It is critical to confirm whether the battery is new, tested or original. Otherwise, expect performance issues such as rapid discharge or failure to hold a charge. A device with a worn-out battery is rarely worth the lower upfront cost, as you'll likely need to replace the battery soon after purchase.\n\nSAVE UP TO 64% ON DYSON, DEWALT, ANKER, ADIDAS AND MORE DURING EBAY'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY SALE\n\n6) Software updates and compatibility\n\nYou should only use electronic items like phones, laptops, tablets and smartwatches as long as they're receiving software updates. Many might disagree with this, but the truth is that once software support ends, your device becomes vulnerable to all kinds of unpatchable security flaws. Some good brands known for reliable software support are Apple, Samsung, Google, MSI and Lenovo.\n\nBefore purchasing, always verify that the device is still supported with regular updates. This information is often available on the manufacturer's website or through trusted tech resources.\n\n7) Test the device thoroughly after purchase\n\nTesting a refurbished device thoroughly upon arrival is a best practice I've recommended repeatedly in my writing. Even trusted sellers can occasionally miss a defect. I always advise checking every essential function, such as the screen, charging port, Wi-Fi, sound and camera, within the seller's return period. Many problems won't be obvious from photos or descriptions alone.\n\nImmediate testing ensures you catch issues early enough to return or replace the product without hassle. It's a small investment of time that prevents far bigger frustrations later.\n\nAnd don't forget to perform your own factory reset on iPhone, Android, PC or Mac to ensure no old accounts, locks or data are lingering on the device. For Apple devices, make sure \"Find My iPhone\" has been disabled before purchase, or it may be unusable.\n\n8) Install strong antivirus software\n\nRefurbished devices can sometimes carry hidden risks, especially if the previous owner didn't wipe the device properly or if the seller missed deep software issues. Installing strong antivirus software is essential to protect your device from malware, spyware or other security threats that may be lurking.\n\nThe best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\n\nGet my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.\n\n9) Use a password manager\n\nSecurity doesn't end with antivirus protection. Many refurbished devices come with pre-installed software or misconfigured settings that could expose you to risk. One of the smartest moves you can make is using a reliable password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.\n\nNext, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.\n\nCheck out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.\n\n10) Know the real value of your savings\n\nRefurbished doesn't always mean a bargain. As a rule of thumb, expect to save 20-40% compared to new, depending on the brand, age and condition. If you're only saving 10-15%, the trade-off on warranty, lifespan or battery may not be worth it. Calculate the long-term cost, especially if you'll need to buy a new battery or accessories soon after.\n\n6 KITCHEN ITEMS THAT EXPERTS 'WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND' BUYING AT SECONDHAND SHOPS\n\nBonus: The eco-friendly upside\n\nEvery refurbished device purchased keeps one more gadget out of the landfill and reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing. Studies show buying refurbished can cut a product's carbon footprint nearly in half. That means you're not only saving money but also helping the planet.\n\nKurt's key takeaway\n\nBuying refurbished electronics can be a great way to save money and reduce e-waste. But it pays to be careful. By sticking with certified sellers, knowing what \"refurbished\" really means and insisting on warranties and clear return policies, you can protect both your wallet and your data.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHave you ever bought a refurbished electronic device?

                "text": "The final stage of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a was abandoned in chaotic and violent scenes, after groups of pro-Palestine protesters swamped the finish line area and presentation podium in central Madrid on Sunday.\n\nAs huge crowds engulfed the finish area, the race leader Jonas Vingegaard, his Visma Lease-a-bike team and the rest of the peloton were forced to turn back from the city centre, with more than 55km still to race on stage 21. In an official statement, the Vuelta organisers said: \u201cFor security reasons, stage 21 of La Vuelta has been ended early. There will be no podium ceremony.\u201d\n\nSpanish media reported that about 3,000 protesters were at the finish line and it was also claimed that there had been violent exchanges between police and protesters. Security sources told Spanish media they had \u201cto charge at the protesters who were throwing barriers and bottles\u201d. The Spanish government later said more than 100,000 people were at the rally in Madrid.\n\nAfter days of vociferous protests directed towards the Israel Premier Tech team, extra police had been brought into Madrid in a bid to secure the final stage, in what was the largest security operation since the city hosted a Nato summit in 2022.\n\nA huge crowd of protesters pushed over race barriers, close to the Plaza de Col\u00f3n and Gran V\u00eda, as security forces lost control of the situation. Police charged some of the protesters and fired teargas, but the race route was overwhelmed.\n\nAs the peloton arrived in Madrid, with 56km to race, riders at the rear were delayed and also pushed by protesters holding anti\u2011Israel banners. The race organisers then stopped the front of the race and lengthy discussions with the Guardia Civil led to the decision to cancel the stage.\n\nSoon afterwards, a glum-looking Vingegaard was seen sharing a muted celebratory handshake with his teammates, as he made his way directly to his team hotel.\n\nBefore the stage the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, had expressed his \u201cadmiration\u201d for the demonstrators. Speaking in M\u00e1laga, he said: \u201cWe would like to express our gratitude and absolute respect for the athletes but also our admiration for the Spanish people who mobilise for just causes, such as Palestine.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said: \u201cHe encouraged protesters to take to the streets. The pro-Palestinian mob listened to the inciting messages and attacked La Vuelta. The sporting event that has always been a source of pride for Spain has been cancelled. S\u00e1nchez and his government: shame on Spain!\u201d\n\nThe collapse of the third biggest Grand Tour of the year has plunged World Tour racing into crisis, with the continued presence of the Israel Premier Tech team, recently endorsed by Benjamin Netanyahu, the object of the increasingly enraged protest groups at the roadside.\n\nA week ago, as pressure increased on the team, owned by the billionaire entrepreneur Sylvan Adams, to withdraw from the Vuelta, Netanyahu posted: \u201cGreat job to Sylvan and Israel\u2019s cycling team for not giving in to hatred and intimidation. You make Israel proud!\u201d\n\nThe disruptions throughout the three-week race affected multiple stages and led to the cancellation of planned stage finishes and the shortening of the race distance.\n\nVingegaard, speaking last Monday to Danish media, said of the protests: \u201cPeople do it for a reason. It\u2019s horrible what\u2019s happening currently and I think those protesting do so here, because they need a forum to be heard.\u201d\n\nThe Tour de France Grand Depart takes place in Barcelona in July next year and Spanish protest groups are targeting the French race. The Palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of Israel told Swiss media \u201cprotests will continue at cycling races as long as hypocritical western institutions absolve Israel\u201d, adding: \u201cThe immediate finish line is the end of the genocide.\u201d\n\nLast week the civil disobedience group Futuro Vegetal said it was \u201cvery likely\u201d that there would be further protests in Barcelona and added that \u201cprotesting at the Tour de France is the least we can do\u201d.\n\nDespite the cancellation of the stage, Vingegaard still won the race overall, from the Portuguese Jo\u00e3o Almeida in second place. It was the Dane\u2019s third Grand Tour victory, after his wins in the Tour de France in 2022 and 2023. Tom Pidcock, double Olympic gold medallist in mountain biking, took his first Grand Tour podium, finishing third overall. The planned podium ceremony and final presentation ceremony were cancelled."

                "article_summary": "Umar Khalid, a prominent political prisoner in India, has spent five years in Tihar jail under terrorism charges stemming from the 2020 Delhi riots, which left 53 dead, primarily Muslims. His bail pleas have been repeatedly denied, and his case has drawn criticism from human rights organizations for alleged fabricated evidence and a lack of due process. Despite the harsh conditions of his imprisonment, Khalid remains resilient, finding solace in books and maintaining hope for justice and democracy.",

                "text": "\u201cThere is indeed something about captivity that makes one feel like a state of somewhere between life and death,\u201d wrote Umar Khalid in June in a letter penned as his fifth year languishing behind bars approached.\n\nFew understand the purgatory of jail like Khalid. For five years \u2013 since his arrest in September 2020 under a draconian terrorism law \u2013 he has remained India\u2019s most prominent political prisoner, to many a potent symbol of the systematic crushing of dissent under the dominant Hindu nationalist regime of the prime minister, Narendra Modi.\n\nThis month the Delhi high court became the latest to deny the bail pleas of Khalid and his alleged co-conspirators. His bail case is now with the supreme court, where a hearing was delayed again on Friday. In the meantime he has remained detained in Delhi\u2019s notorious Tihar jail without a conviction to his name.\n\nKhalid, a Muslim and leftwing activist, is accused of being a key conspirator in the Delhi riots in which violent religious mobs rampaged across the north-west of the city in February 2020. Most of the 53 people killed in the riots were Muslims and several mosques were burned to the ground.\n\nBefore his arrest Khalid had emerged as one of the faces of an anti-government protest movement after the Modi government passed a citizenship law in late 2019 that was seen as discriminatory to Muslims. The protests that erupted were the first widespread challenge to the Modi regime and were met with brute force by the state. Dozens were killed by police fire and activists were detained and tortured.\n\nIn the months that followed, many of those who had been prominent protest organisers and voices began to be accused of acts of terror, while figures associated with Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party who had made direct calls to violence in Delhi just before the riots erupted faced no action.\n\nKhalid has denied all charges, and the case against him and other Muslim activists named in the police charges has drawn scrutiny and criticism from lawyers and human rights groups. Much of the case against him concerns alleged secret meetings disclosed by uncorroborated witnesses and his membership of certain WhatsApp groups where he did not post any messages. Khalid was not in Delhi when the riots took place and the speech he is accused of making to stir up the riots took place more than 1,000 miles away in Maharashtra state.\n\nIt was here, on camera, where Khalid told a crowd: \u201cWe won\u2019t respond to violence with violence. We won\u2019t respond to hate with hate. If they spread hate, we will respond to it with love.\u201d\n\nIn a mounting number of Delhi riots cases, the Delhi police have been found by judges to have fabricated evidence, created fictitious witnesses and forced witnesses to record statements dictated by officers. Delhi police have not responded to these allegations.\n\nShuddhabrata Sengupta, a friend of Khalid\u2019s who has written extensively about his case, said the Kafkaesque situation Khalid had been put through in trying to get bail demonstrated that \u201cthe process is the punishment here\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe message it is intended to give is clear: that if you are a Muslim in India today, and you dare to stand up for your rights and for peace and non-violence, you will be persecuted,\u201d Sengupta said.\n\nIn a joint statement released on the fifth anniversary of Khalid\u2019s detention last week, Amnesty International and six other human rights organisations condemned his \u201ccontinued unjust detention without trial\u201d and called for his immediate release.\n\n\u201cStarved of justice, Khalid\u2019s prolonged persecution exemplifies the derailment of justice in India as it makes a mockery of international human rights principles,\u201d said Aakar Patel, the chair of Amnesty India, whose operations were shut down by the Modi government in 2020. \u201cKhalid\u2019s detention is not an isolated case and is emblematic of a broader pattern of repression faced by those who dare to exercise their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.\u201d\n\nBefore his arrest, Khalid had made himself a thorn in the side of the Modi government, which came to power in 2014. An outspoken student activist at Delhi\u2019s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), where he was studying for a PhD, he was vocal against the rising tide of anti-Muslim hatred and persecution under Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist regime. In 2016, after a protest against capital punishment drew national media attention, Khalid was arrested and briefly detained on sedition charges.\n\nIt was the beginning of what his partner, Banojyotsna Lahiri, 41, who was also a PhD student at JNU, described as a \u201ctargeted campaign of hate\u201d against Khalid by the Indian media, who routinely described him as \u201canti-national\u201d. In 2018, two men turned up to a Delhi event with guns and tried to kill Khalid as a \u201cgift for India\u201d.\n\nLahiri said Khalid had expected his arrest to come in 2020 and had even pre-recorded a video. However, she said they had never anticipated that five years later he would still be held as an alleged terrorist and denied the basic right to bail.\n\n\u201cUmar is everything this government hates,\u201d Lahiri said. \u201cHe is Muslim, he is an intellectual, he speaks about the oppressed, he is outspoken, he is fearless and he is an unapologetic dissenting voice. This is their attempt to silence him but it won\u2019t work. We are still fighting for democracy, and in the end the truth will win.\u201d\n\nLahiri visits him every week in prison where he insists they keep the conversation joyful and they laugh together, even as he lived through a deadly Covid wave sweeping through the prison and the extreme heat of Delhi summers. To feed his voracious reading appetite, she usually carries in tomes for him, and she estimated he had now read more than 300 books while in jail \u2013 everything from Russian classics to contemporary Indian fiction and political biographies.\n\nEach week he is allowed a 30-minute video call with his parents in Delhi, and his sisters who live abroad also regularly patch in. \u201cI want to tell you that Umar has no regrets, nor have the years in jail broken his spirit,\u201d said his father, Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas, recently.\n\nFor Khalid, although he acknowledged in his recent writings that \u201cnurturing hope in jail is a risky business\u201d, he said sometimes he found himself \u201camazed how I have survived so long in the same confined space\u201d. But he insisted that thanks to the solace of books and the resilience of his fellow prisoners, \u201cmostly I have been at peace\u201d."

While the exact motive is still not known, on Sunday - before Kimmel spoke - the Utah governor had said the suspect was \"indoctrinated by leftist ideology\".\n\nThe FCC is in charge of granting broadcast licences to networks such as ABC, NBC and CBS, and they are required under statute to be in the public interest.\n\nOn his podcast Verdict with Ted Cruz, the senator emphasised on Friday that he hated what Kimmel said about Kirk, and he is \"thrilled that he was fired\". He also said Carr was \"a good guy\".\n\n\"But what he [Carr] said there is dangerous as hell,\" Cruz added. \"And so he threatens, explicitly, we're going to cancel ABC's licence.\n\n\"We're going to take them off the air so ABC cannot broadcast anymore. He says we can do this the easy way, or we could do this the hard way, yeah. And I got to say that's right out of Goodfellas.\n\n\"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going, nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,\" he added, using a mobster voice.\n\nHe warned that if the government gets into the business of bans and regulating what the media says \"that will end up bad for conservatives\".\n\n\"Going down this road, there will come a time when a Democrat wins again \u2013 wins the White House \u2026 they will silence us. They will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly. And that is dangerous,\" Cruz said.\n\nIn the Oval Office on Friday, President Donald Trump defended Carr and said \"I disagree with Ted Cruz\", who is ordinarily one of his staunchest allies.\n\nAnother Republican Senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, told reporters that Cruz was \"absolutely right\" in his criticism of Carr.\n\nTillis, who will not seek re-election next year, said the FCC chairman's comments were \"just unacceptable behaviour\".\n\nRepublicans in Congress have generally been toeing the party line with their response to Kimmel's suspension as the nation is shaken by the political and cultural aftershocks of Kirk's killing.\n\nBut Senator Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas, sounded a note of caution on Thursday.\n\n\"The conservative position is free speech is free speech, and we better be very careful about any lines we cross in diminishing free speech,\" Moran told Politico.\n\nSouth Dakota Senator Mike Rounds said he would approach it as an \"employer-employee issue\".\n\nKimmel has not publicly commented about his suspension, but his late-night colleagues - including Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert - responded on Thursday with a show of solidarity.\n\nKirk was fatally shot on 10 September during an open-air event on a Utah college campus.\n\nThe motive behind Charlie Kirk's killing: What we know and don't know\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate passed a resolution to designate 14 October - Kirk's birthday - a day of remembrance for him.\n\nLawmakers in the US House of Representatives approved the resolution, but nearly 100 Democrats opposed it.\n\nIn Sacramento, California, police said three shots were fired on Friday afternoon into a window of an ABC10 building while people were inside.\n\nThe shots came from a moving vehicle and nobody was injured, police said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the shooting was a targeted attack or an accidental discharge of a weapon.\n\nABC10 is an affiliate operated by Nexstar, one of the major media companies that cancelled Jimmy Kimmel Live! from its markets this week, citing the host's \"offensive and insensitive\" comments about Kirk."

The individual is not a member of authorized law enforcement working the event and is currently in custody,\" Guglielmi added.\n\nThe individual, who has not been publicly identified, actually was armed, Guglielmi confirmed to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service and local law enforcement are investigating the circumstances as to why he was at the location,\" he also said.\n\n\"This guy is a former deputy sheriff out of Idaho. He came and identified himself with expired credentials. They are going through his background and trying to figure out what he was up to there,\" a federal source familiar with the investigation told Fox News.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance are among the speakers set to honor Kirk on Sunday at the event.\n\nFox News' Matt Finn contributed to this report.\n\n\u200b\n\n\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher called out Hollywood liberals Friday for not acknowledging the Sept. 10 assassination of Charlie Kirk at the Emmys.\n\n\"The left does have this bad attitude of go no contact,\" Maher said during a panel discussion. \"I mean, at the Emmys, would it have killed someone to get up there, since they all want to talk about their politics, would it kill somebody to get up there- not give a speech about how much they liked Charlie Kirk, just to say, 'We had a political assassination this week. And that's wrong.' They would have been booed off the stage because he was on the wrong team. So you're not even allowed to say that.\"\n\n\"Could you imagine if a left-wing person was assassinated that week? The whole show would have been about that,\" Maher added.\n\nSunday's 77th Primetime Emmy Awards made no reference to the horrific murder of the Turning Point USA co-founder, which occurred just days before television's big night. Emmy host Nate Bargatze previously said he planned to avoid political topics during his stint.\n\n\"I know there's heartbreaking stuff that's been happening right now, but I want this night to be an escape, and I think that's why I was brought on,\" he told Entertainment Weekly on Thursday.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe man detained Friday by the Secret Service at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, was armed with a gun and knife and was inside the facility, The Washington Post reported, citing a law enforcement official familiar with the matter.\n\nCharlie Kirk\u2019s memorial service is scheduled to be held at the stadium on Sunday and is undergoing security preparations.\n\nSecret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told Fox News Digital on Saturday that the man was detained \"in the stadium, but it was prior to the setup of any secure perimeter.\"\n\nThe individual said to Secret Service agents that he was at the site to provide private security and presented \"inactive law enforcement credentials,\" the unnamed official added to the Post.\n\n\u201cThis guy is a former deputy sheriff out of Idaho. He came and identified himself with expired credentials,\u201d a federal source familiar with the investigation told Fox News. \u201cThey are going through his background and trying to figure out what he was up to there.\u2019\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service in coordination with local law enforcement in Glendale, Arizona, is investigating an individual who was observed exhibiting suspicious behavior at State Farm Stadium,\" Guglielmi said.\n\n\"The individual was approached by Secret Service and stated during the encounter that he was a member of law enforcement and that he was armed. The individual is not a member of authorized law enforcement working the event and is currently in custody,\" Guglielmi added.\n\nFox News' Matt Finn contributed to this report.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Saturday that former President Barack Obama has \u201cno clue what he is talking about\u201d regarding a claim he made in the wake of Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s cancellation.\n\n\u201cAfter years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn\u2019t like,\u201d Obama wrote on X on Thursday after Kimmel\u2019s show was shelved by ABC.\n\nKimmel's show was pulled over his comments about alleged Charlie Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson.\n\n\"With all due respect to former President Obama, he has no idea what he is talking about. The decision to fire Jimmy Kimmel and to cancel his show came from executives at ABC. That has now been reported,\u201d Leavitt said.\n\n\u201cAnd I can assure you it did not come from the White House and there was no pressure given from the president of the United States. How do I know that? Because I was with the president of the United States when this news broke in the United Kingdom. We were enjoying the beautiful and spectacular state visit that was put forth by the Royal Family and the prime minister of the U.K., Keir Starmer,\u201d Leavitt continued.\n\n\u201cAnd I actually brought this news to President Trump's attention, he had no idea this was happening. It was a decision that was made by ABC because Jimmy Kimmel chose to knowingly lie to his audience on his program about the death of a highly-respected man when our country is in a state of mourning. That was a decision that he made and he is now facing a consequence for that decision and for that lie,\u201d Leavitt also said, noting, \"Jimmy Kimmel's ratings are in the gutter and this was probably also a business decision on behalf of ABC.\"\n\nFox News Digital's Stephanie Giang-Paunon contributed to this report.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, a debate about political rhetoric and its impact on recent spates of political violence has taken hold on Capitol Hill and across the country.\n\nWhile both Republicans and Democrats have condemned political violence of all kinds, their views vary on how much inflammatory political rhetoric plays a role. Some Republicans have accused the left's rhetoric of fostering an \"assassination culture\" on the left, while Democrats have accused Republicans of attacks on free speech.\n\nOne member of Congress, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., attempted to steer the conversation towards gun control as opposed to rhetoric as the cause for the increase in political violence.\n\n\"This isn't just about what happened to Charlie Kirk. At the same time his tragic killing was happening, three kids were getting shot in school, and that was one or two weeks after another couple of kids were getting shot, in church, at mass, at a Catholic school,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nBut GOP firebrand Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., did not mince words about those who continue to foment hatred for conservatives with inflammatory rhetoric.\n\n\"We need to shame these people out of polite society, shame them out of existence. They need to be fired from their jobs. They are putting lives in danger,\" Mace said. \"They are denying that they're celebrating the political assassination and murder of Charlie Kirk, but they're liars. They're lying through their teeth.\"\n\nLawmakers from both sides of the aisle have called on others to \"turn down the heat\" in the wake of Kirk's assassination.\n\n\u200b\n\nAs security preparations intensify for Charlie Kirk\u2019s memorial service in Arizona, a former NYPD detective and security consultant warns mourners to remain alert.\n\n\"Pull your face out of your phone, put it in your pocket. Pay attention,\" Pat Brosnan urged.\n\nThe memorial, set for this weekend at State Farm Stadium, is expected to draw an enormous crowd. Officials estimate that more than 100,000 people may gather in and around the venue, including attendees inside the 63,000-seat stadium and overflow areas outside.\n\n\"From the moment you arrive\u2026 have your eyes wide open\u2026 who's to your right, who's to your left, who's behind you? What are they doing?\" Brosnan told Fox News Digital. \"Eyes in the backs and the sides of your head.\"\n\nAccording to a law enforcement bulletin obtained by ABC News, authorities are \"tracking several threats of unknown credibility.\"\n\n\"Violent extremists and unaffiliated lone offenders may view the memorial service or related events as attractive attack targets due to the attendance of these individuals, other senior U.S. government officials, state and local government officials, and political activists and due to major international media attention,\" the memo reportedly says.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has designated Kirk\u2019s memorial service a Level 1 Special Event, the highest possible rating, matching Super Bowl-level security planning.\n\nCNN commentator Van Jones revealed that Charlie Kirk invited him to come onto his show the day before he was assassinated at Utah Valley University.\n\nThe outreach came as both Jones and Kirk gave differing opinions in reaction to the killing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska, who was fatally stabbed in the neck on a light rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Aug. 22. The suspect was identified as Decarlos Brown.\n\n\u201cHey, Van, I mean it, I\u2019d love to have you on my show to have a respectful conversation about crime and race. I would be a gentleman as I know you would be as well. We can disagree about the issues agreeably,\u201d Jones said Kirk wrote to him in a private message on X.\n\nJones said before he could respond, Kirk was assassinated.\n\nThousands are showing up coast to coast for memorials and vigils honoring the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nAn estimated 1,500 to 2,000 people attended a candlelight vigil on Thursday at Soldiers Field in Rochester, Minnesota, according to the Rochester Post Bulletin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to honor Charlie Kirk and all victims taken by cowardly acts of violence, regardless of who they are, what they believe and what they stand for,\u201d Brad Trahan, a Rochester resident and organizer of the event, told the newspaper. \u201cWe come together to dedicate ourselves to peace. Charlie\u2019s life symbolized dialogue, peace, faith and that goodwill will always supersede evil.\u201d\n\nThe day before, around 200 people gathered for an event on the campus of California State University, Fresno, to pay tribute to Kirk, KFSN reported.\n\nImages also captured mourners attending vigils in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, and Newark, Delaware, among other events.\n\nAn Arizona-based chapter of the progressive group Indivisible is asking its members to stay home Sunday when Charlie Kirk\u2019s memorial service takes place in Glendale.\n\n\u201cWe believe strongly in the right to protest and speak out, but we also know there are moments where restraint protects both our community and our democracy,\u201d Brent Peak, co-chair of Northwest Valley Indivisible, said in a statement. \u201cThis is one of those moments.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe urge our members and the broader community to choose safety and solidarity over confrontation at this event,\u201d Peak added. \u201cOur commitment to democracy and free speech remains strong, but we will not allow ourselves to be used as props in someone else\u2019s attempt to stir violence.\u201d\n\nOn its website, Indivisible describes itself as a \u201cmovement of thousands of group leaders and more than a million members taking regular, iterative, and increasingly complex actions to resist the GOPs agenda, elect local champions, and fight for progressive policies.\u201d"

                "text": "Here are eight Democrats Harris calls out in her new memoir:\n\nGavin Newsom\n\nThe California governor, and Harris\u2019 longtime friend and competitor in their home state, was among the Democrats the former vice president exposed for their response in the hours after Biden dropped out of the race.\n\n\u201cHiking. Will call back,\u201d Harris wrote of Newsom\u2019s response in notes from her calls that day.\n\n\u201cHe never did,\u201d she pointedly added in her memoir, skipping reference to Newsom\u2019s subsequent endorsement hours later.\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom previously declined to comment to POLITICO on the anecdote.\n\nHarris and Newsom, both natives of the Bay Area , have had long and oftentimes overlapping political careers. While Harris, up until her book tour, has largely faded from view after her failed presidential bid, Newsom\u2019s popularity has grown among Democratic voters, especially after the White House sent National Guard troops to the Golden State.\n\nThe California governor has come increasingly in the spotlight as one of the few Democratic voices willing to match Trump\u2019s preferred tough-talking form of public sparring.\n\nGretchen Whitmer\n\nNewsom wasn\u2019t the only Democrat whose response the vice president described as lukewarm.\n\nIn her memoir, Harris recounted Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s reticence to commit to an endorsement. According to Harris, Whitmer said she needed to \u201clet the dust settle\u201d following Biden\u2019s withdrawal from the race before making a public statement.\n\nWhitmer, whose name had been floated at the time as a possible Democratic candidate to replace Biden, endorsed Harris the following day \u2014 and announced that she would co-chair Harris\u2019 presidential campaign.\n\nA spokesperson for the governor declined to comment on the record.\n\nJB Pritzker\n\nAccording to her call notes from the day of Biden\u2019s withdrawal, which Harris presented in an italicized list in the early pages of her memoir, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker also declined to immediately offer an immediate endorsement.\n\n\u201cAs governor of Illinois, I\u2019m the convention host,\u201d Harris described as Pritzker\u2019s response. \u201cI can\u2019t commit.\u201d\n\nPritzker endorsed Harris the day after Biden dropped out.\n\n\u201cGov. Pritzker fought hard to elect Vice President Harris and Democrats across the state and country,\u201d said a spokesperson for the governor. \u201cHe\u2019s proud to have helped lead a convention that built momentum and showcased the Harris-Walz ticket.\u201d\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nIn a shocking dig at the former Transportation secretary, whom Harris described as a \u201cclose friend,\u201d Harris wrote that while Buttigieg was her top pick to join her on the presidential ticket, she ultimately didn\u2019t select him because she didn\u2019t believe America was ready for a Black woman and a gay man in the White House.\n\n\u201cWe were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man. Part of me wanted to say, Screw it, let\u2019s just do it. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk,\u201d Harris wrote, adding that \u201cI think Pete also knew that \u2014 to our mutual sadness.\u201d\n\nBut according to Buttigieg, Harris\u2019 concerns were \u201cnot something that we ever talked about.\u201d\n\nThe former Transportation secretary told POLITICO on Thursday that he was \u201csurprised\u201d to read Harris\u2019 thought process on his potential vice presidential candidacy in an excerpt of her book published this week, saying he believes in \u201cgiving Americans more credit\u201d than assuming they wouldn\u2019t vote for both of them.\n\nJosh Shapiro\n\nShapiro, who was also in the running to be Harris\u2019 No. 2, didn\u2019t make the cut either.\n\nHarris was concerned that the Pennsylvania governor\u2019s ambition would prove an obstacle to his willingness to serve in a secondary role to hers.\n\nShapiro \u201cmused that he would want to be in the room for every decision,\u201d Harris recalled in the memoir, writing that she responded bluntly that \u201ca vice president is not a copresident.\u201d\n\nShe just couldn\u2019t trust that he would settle for a role as No. 2.\n\nAnd while Harris lauded Shapiro as \u201cpoised, polished and personable,\u201d she said he \u201cpeppered\u201d her and her staff with questions \u2014 including how many bedrooms were in the vice president\u2019s home and \u201chow he might arrange to get Pennsylvania artists\u2019 work on loan from the Smithsonian.\u201d\n\nShapiro also showed a \u201clack of discretion\u201d in the process, Harris wrote, citing an incident when his car \u2014 with Pennsylvania plates \u2014 was filmed by CNN outside of her residence despite her staff\u2019s efforts to secure the governor less obvious transportation.\n\nA spokesperson for Shapiro pushed back on Harris\u2019 characterization of the governor, telling POLITICO this week that \u201cit\u2019s simply ridiculous to suggest that Governor Shapiro was focused on anything other than defeating Donald Trump and protecting Pennsylvania from the chaos we are living through now.\u201d\n\nMark Kelly\n\nThe Arizona senator, a former astronaut and retired naval officer, was a strong contender in the veepstakes, Harris recalled, describing him as \u201cmagnetic\u201d and saying that she \u201cadmired\u201d him.\n\nBut while Kelly was an \u201cAmerican ideal of selfless service,\u201d he was also \u201cuntarnished\u201d politically. He had yet to weather an \u201c\u2018oh shit\u2019 moment,\u201d Harris wrote, saying that she \u201cwasn\u2019t sure\u201d how he would handle the kind of attacks Trump was likely to lob his way.\n\nHarris was also wary of the fact that Kelly was slow to sign the pro-labor PRO Act \u2014 a choice that she called a \u201cred flag.\u201d\n\nThe senator\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nAfter remaining quiet in the aftermath of her 2024 campaign, Harris finally opened the floodgates on her former boss, calling his decision to run for a second term \u201creckless.\u201d\n\nThough she did not believe it was \u201cincapacity,\u201d Biden was old, Harris wrote. And it showed. At 81, the president was tired, manifesting in \u201cphysical and verbal stumbles,\u201d Harris wrote.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise that the debate debacle happened right after two back-to-back trips to Europe and a flight to the West Coast for a Hollywood fundraiser,\u201d she said.\n\nA spokesperson for Biden previously declined to comment on her book, but several former aides were critical of previously published excerpts in interviews with POLITICO.\n\nBut while she did have \u201cconcerns\u201d about Biden\u2019s ability to lead a successful campaign, Harris emphasized that \u201cthere was a distinction between his ability to campaign and his ability to govern,\u201d writing that he \u201cnavigated successfully through intensely dangerous world events.\u201d\n\nHarris stressed that her relationship with Biden was a good one, describing their rapport as \u201cgenuine,\u201d based on a foundation of shared values despite being people who \u201cseemingly couldn\u2019t have been more different.\u201d\n\nStill, Harris describes the frustration that she and her husband, Doug, experienced feeling that she had to repeatedly prove her loyalty to the president.\n\n\u201cI had to prove my loyalty, time and time again,\u201d Harris wrote.\n\nBut Biden and his White House didn\u2019t offer the same in return. When she was cast as a \u201cDEI hire\u201d or mocked for her laugh by conservatives, the White House stayed silent.\n\n\u201cGetting anything positive said about my work or any defense against untrue attacks was almost impossible,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe also specifically mentioned that Biden called her before her crucial debate with Donald Trump in 2024 to inquire why she supposedly was critical of him to donors. The call rattled her, she wrote.\n\nBiden\u2019s inner circle\n\nBut her broadsides weren\u2019t just reserved for the former president.\n\nHarris directed a volley of criticisms at Biden\u2019s inner circle, blaming them for pushing her to the side as her popularity grew in a series of moves that she said ultimately held her back from beating Trump.\n\nBiden\u2019s team thrust thorny policy items onto her plate, reprimanding her after a viral speech she made and failed to defend her against attacks from Republicans and conservative media \u2014 even \u201cadding fuel to negative narratives,\u201d including reports of staff turnover in her office \u2014 Harris wrote.\n\nAnd perhaps most of all, Harris blamed Biden\u2019s confidants for not pushing him to step aside sooner.\n\n\u201c\u2019It\u2019s Joe and Jill\u2019s decision.\u2019 We all said that, like a mantra, as if we\u2019d all been hypnotized,\u201d Harris wrote."

When Baier pressed Harris on her past support of tax-payer-funded gender transition surgeries for prisoners, Harris shied away from taking a stance and called it a \"remote issue.\"\n\nStill, the topic of trans athletes in women's sports may have haunted Harris on election day, according to data.\n\nA national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America (CWA) legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of \"Donald Trump\u2019s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women\u2019s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women\u2019s bathrooms,\" as important to them. And 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was \"very important.\"\n\nSince the election, many key Democrats have distanced themselves from outwardly supporting trans athletes in women's sports.\n\nMeanwhile, a report by the New York Times suggests that former President Joe Biden himself did not agree with trans athletes participating in women's and girls' sports.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"According to a number of former Biden-administration officials, there remained a simmering debate inside the administration about whether those Title IX protections should extend to sports,\" the Times reported, saying that \"one side\u2026maintained that there was no legal difference between letting trans students use bathrooms that align with their gender identity and letting trans student athletes play on sports teams that align with their gender identity.\"\n\nHowever, Biden was \"on the other side\u2026who believed that the competitive, zero-sum nature of sports made them different from bathrooms \u2014 that some transgender athletes would enjoy unfair physical advantages over women.\n\n\"Most important, one of the officials holding this view was Biden himself,\" the Times wrote.\n\nThe Times received a quote from a former Biden administration official who said Biden was \"particularly focused on the competition issue.\""

                "text": "We were dealt our first blow last week as Wyoming collapsed after holding Utah to just three points in the first half. Not covering a 23.5-point spread after going into the break down 3-0 is a tough break, but that\u2019s why we call these picks \u201cUgly Underdogs.\u201d Our dreams of a perfect season are over, but we\u2019ll try to get to 3-1 with the Temple Owls on Saturday.\n\nThe Post\u2019s betting staff had a meeting this week and during the small-talk portion of the powwow, one colleague revealed he bet Temple against Oklahoma last weekend.\n\nI\u2019m paraphrasing, but this intrepid bettor summed up the experience thusly: \u201cEvery time I tuned in, Temple was doing something bad.\u201d\n\nSounds like a ringing endorsement for a play on the Owls this weekend against one of the early darlings of the college football season, Georgia Tech.\n\nThere\u2019s no getting around it: Temple was overmatched by Oklahoma in Week 3.\n\nThe Sooners raced out to a 28-3 lead at the half, and then took their foot off the pedal en route to a 42-3 shellacking. Temple tallied just 104 yards of offense and averaged 1.9 yards per play. Not great, Bob.\n\nBut here\u2019s the important bit: It turns out that Oklahoma is very good.\n\nTemple vs. Georgia Tech odds, prediction\n\nThe Sooners have been shot out of a cannon to start the season, and quarterback John Mateer has established himself as an early Heisman frontrunner. The defense has been humming too.\n\nNobody is going to bump Temple up in their power rankings after getting routed, but don\u2019t let a blowout loss against one of the best teams in the country hide the fact that the Owls look like an improved bunch under new head coach, K.C. Keeler.\n\nBetting on College Football?\n\nCheck out the best College Football betting sites\n\nRead our expert\u2019s guide on how to bet on College Football\n\nGet the latest College Football National Championship winner odds\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to throw a parade for beating UMass and Howard by a combined score of 97-17, but it\u2019s also important to remember where Temple was coming from before this season started.\n\nThe Owls went 3-9 in 2024 and finished the campaign ranked as the 127th-best team in the country according to Bill Connelly\u2019s SP+ rankings, a catch-all metric that holds considerable respect in the college football world.\n\nIt\u2019s early days, but Temple currently sits No. 98 in SP+.\n\nThis is a decent jump considering this is Year 1 under Keeler, who just finished a tremendous spell at Sam Houston State.\n\nBefore that, Keeler turned Delaware into an FCS juggernaut, laying the foundation for the Blue Hens to join the FBS this season.\n\nHe wins everywhere he goes, and I\u2019ve got no doubt he\u2019ll have Temple turned around sooner rather than later.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you should expect Temple to give Georgia Tech a run for its money Saturday, but this game does have all the right ingredients for a market overreaction.\n\nGeorgia Tech is in a letdown spot after a seismic win over Clemson, Temple is coming in off a blowout loss, and the Yellow Jackets have become a romantic story after spending years in the college football wilderness.\n\nThis may sound like a bad idea after Temple failed to cover a big spread against the Sooners, but the Owls should profile well as a pesky underdog this season.\n\nThey\u2019re in the early throes of a rebuild, but Keeler is a master at getting programs heading in the right direction, and I have faith that Temple will give a decent account of themselves as a 23.5-point underdog at Bobby Dodd Stadium on Saturday.\n\nBET: Temple +23.5 (-108, DraftKings)\n\nWhy Trust New York Post Betting\n\nMichael Leboff is a long-suffering Islanders fan, but a long-profiting sports bettor with 10 years of experience in the gambling industry.

They have lost each of their first two games against FBS opponents this season, including a 69-3 defeat at Oregon on Sept. 6.\n\nOklahoma State's lone win so far in 2025 was against FCS opponent Tennessee-Martin. The team's once-high-powered offense is currently tied with Northern Illinois for 127th out of 134 FBS programs with 14.0 points per game.\n\nThe 58-year-old Gundy has deep ties to the Oklahoma State. He played quarterback for the program from 1986 to '89, leading it to back-to-back 10-win seasons in '87 and '88.\n\nGundy is also the longest-tenured head coach in Cowboys history. He is the program's all-time leader in games (261), wins (170), bowl appearances (18) and bowl wins (12).\n\nHaving lost two of its first three games, Oklahoma State will now head into Big 12 play trying to turn its season around. It will open its conference schedule at home against Baylor on Sept. 27."

                "text": "\u201cThey\u2019re not going to want to run against the president\u2019s policies, on one hand, but on the other hand, they also don\u2019t want to eliminate the constituency which supports childhood vaccines,\u201d Dorit Reiss, an attorney specializing in vaccine policy, said of the choice Republicans face. \u201cSo I think they\u2019re going to have to sit down and do some math in an area that\u2019s full of landmines.\u201d\n\nIn Louisiana, lobbyists are planning to reintroduce a \u201cmedical freedom\u201d bill that failed last year to ban vaccine mandates, but expanded to include schools.\n\n\u201cWe feel like the climate is ready for it,\u201d said Jill Hines, co-director of the anti-vaccine group Health Freedom Louisiana. \u201cThat conversation has already started with Florida\u2019s foot in the door.\u201d\n\nIn the Lone Star state \u2013 where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott capitalized on outrage over pandemic restrictions \u2013 Jackie Schlegel, president of anti-vaccine group Texans for Medical Freedom, promised \u201csweeping reforms in Texas in the coming years.\u201d\n\n\u201cPutting parents as the sole decision maker and not the CDC or local school districts is what our legislators are talking about,\u201d she added.\n\nAnd Idaho lawmakers are expected to build upon an expansive \u201cmedical freedom\u201d bill enacted earlier this year that prohibits businesses and schools from mandating \u201cmedical interventions,\u201d including vaccines, although it allows for some exemptions.\n\nBut the politics of undoing vaccine requirements in schools \u2013 mandates that health experts credit with keeping injection rates high \u2013 are complicated. Polling shows Americans \u2014 including most Republicans \u2014 broadly support such mandates for schoolchildren. President Donald Trump\u2019s own pollster warned Republicans against mistaking opposition to Covid shots among Republicans \u201cas evidence that Republican voters are against all vaccinations. To do so would be folly.\u201d\n\nYet the MAHA movement \u2013 which includes people who share Kennedy\u2019s skepticism of vaccine safety \u2013 has emerged as a powerful force within the GOP, broadening the party\u2019s tent and motivating some voters to turn out for Trump. Mothers comprise a large component of the MAHA coalition, and recent polling conducted by Bellwether Research revealed that nearly a quarter of women surveyed don\u2019t believe vaccines administered in the U.S. are generally safe.\n\nMonths out from legislative sessions resuming across the country, no other state lawmaker or official has yet to step forward with plans to replicate Florida\u2019s approach. But public health experts are fearful that Gov. Ron DeSantis could still set off a domino effect in GOP states. Florida is the first state to take sweeping executive action to remove school mandates, with its health department moving forward with rules to end requirements for four vaccines, including chickenpox. Removing mandates for measles and polio would require action from the state legislature.\n\n\u201cI would imagine that other red states are looking at this and trying to make an assessment about whether they want to follow Florida\u2019s lead,\u201d said Jennifer Kates, senior vice president at KFF, a health research group. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the end of the story.\u201d\n\nFollowing the pandemic, GOP states ushered in a wave of legislation allowing more exemptions to school vaccine mandates for religious or even personal beliefs. Pursuing outright bans in schools or medical facilities has long been anti-vaxxers\u2019 on wishlists; now they believe Kennedy\u2019s posture fosters a favorable political environment.\n\nAaron Siri, a vaccine injury lawyer who provides counsel for the Informed Consent Action Network, an anti-vaccine group that writes model state legislation, said \u201cmandates are the tool of bullies, criminals and dictators.\u201d\n\nLike-minded groups may have trouble finding state lawmakers to propose their desired legislation though. Some legislators who have championed easing state requirements believe they\u2019ve achieved most of what is politically feasible.\n\nLouisiana Rep. Kathy Edmonston credited Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement for launching \u201ca whole new way to look at public health.\u201d But the Republican, who sponsored laws signed by GOP Gov. Jeff Landry prohibiting Louisiana schools from requiring Covid shots and requiring that they inform parents of their rights to an exemption, said she has \u201cno plans to change what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have everybody on the same page,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re requiring the parent to get your child vaccinated. But we\u2019re telling you that if it goes against anything in your line of thinking, that you have the opportunity to exempt your child.\u201dLouisiana already had one of the nation\u2019s most lenient school vaccine policies, issuing exemptions on the request of a parent for any reason. No school system in the country requires Covid vaccination.\n\nAlabama state Rep. Mack Butler recently reintroduced a bill to allow parents requesting a religious exemption to send a note to a child\u2019s school instead of submitting a written objection and then getting approval from local health officials. Still, the Republican hasn\u2019t heard of any initiative that would eliminate requirements altogether, and he called vaccines for mumps, measles and polio \u201ctried and tested.\u201d\n\nHealth care experts remain nervous about the potential for GOP leaders to bypass the legislature and act on their own to weaken vaccine policy. In Louisiana, Surgeon General Ralph Abraham last year directed the health department to no longer promote mass vaccinations. And while West Virginia lawmakers voted down a religious exemption bill in March, Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed an executive order that allows families to bypass vaccine requirements for religious reasons just hours after taking office this year. West Virginia is now mired in legal battles surrounding the implications of the governor\u2019s order and the state Board of Education\u2019s decision to continue requiring vaccines as the legal process plays out.\n\nRising anti-vaccine sentiment puts more pressure on state health officials to form a bulwark against efforts to chip away mandates, like in Mississippi, where its medical leadership has been steadfast.\n\n\u201cWe have a really strong, educated legislature that values evidence-based medicine, and they\u2019ve seen the importance of vaccines in preventing unnecessary deaths,\u201d said Katherine Pannel, president of the Mississippi State Medical Association, a professional society for doctors. \u201cThey have been really valuable. So when any legislation to weaken the vaccine legislation has come up, they have been on target and have killed any kind of legislation.\u201d\n\nFlorida is bound to face legal challenges that could slow or prohibit any repeal from going into effect, said James Hodge, an Arizona State University professor who specializes in vaccine law.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a state of flux with Florida,\u201d Hodge said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching very carefully what and how far they go with this legally.\u201d\n\nFlorida health care advocates intend to mount an aggressive campaign in opposition \u2013 and hope to send a warning about extreme political and health risks to other red states.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that other states don\u2019t do this. We\u2019re seeing at the national level an immense threat to the nation\u2019s vaccine policy,\u201d said Northe Saunders, president of American Families for Vaccines, an advocacy group that promotes immunization. \u201cAny erosion at any level of government is going to put kids at risk and they\u2019re going to get sick and unfortunately, people are going to die.\u201d"

While 26 nations have committed to a \"reassurance force\" in Ukraine, there is skepticism about whether these commitments will translate into concrete military support against Russia. Stubb expressed concern over the lack of political will among European leaders for such commitments and noted that any effective guarantees would require backing from the U.S., which remains uncertain amidst ongoing negotiations.",

                "text": "Finland\u2019s president, Alexander Stubb, has said security guarantees for Ukraine, which are being discussed by the so-called \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d, would compel the European countries that sign to fight Russia if Moscow launched military action against Ukraine again in future.\n\n\u201cSecurity guarantees in essence are a deterrent. That deterrent has to be plausible and in order for it to be plausible it has to be strong,\u201d Stubb told the Guardian, in an interview in Helsinki before travelling to New York for the UN general assembly.\n\nHe said the guarantees would only come into effect after a future deal between Ukraine and Russia, but insisted that Russia would have no veto over their format.\n\n\u201cRussia has absolutely no say in the sovereign decisions of an independent nation state \u2026 So for me it\u2019s not an issue will Russia agree or not. Of course they won\u2019t, but that\u2019s not the point,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the Paris meeting last month, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, told reporters that 26 nations had committed to be part of a \u201creassurance force\u201d in Ukraine, with some of them committing to be present \u201con the ground, in the sea or in the air\u201d.\n\nHowever, the big question many in Kyiv have is whether the arrangements would come with concrete commitments. When asked if the guarantees would mean European countries were saying they would be ready to engage militarily with Russia in the case of future aggression against Ukraine, Stubb said: \u201cThat is the idea of security guarantees by definition.\u201d\n\nIt is far from clear that there is political will for this kind of commitment in most European capitals, however, where promises to a postwar Ukraine have usually been framed more as \u201creassurance\u201d than as firm commitments. Up to now, the policy of most western countries has been to offer support to Ukraine but minimise the risk of a direct conflict with Russia. But Stubb said any guarantees would be meaningless if not backed up with real force.\n\n\u201cSecurity guarantees in essence are a deterrent and that deterrent has to be plausible, and in order for it to be plausible it has to be strong. And that means also strategic communication, so we\u2019re not making security guarantees into the air, but we\u2019re making real security guarantees and Russia knows that,\u201d said Stubb.\n\nStubb has emerged as a key player in peace negotiations in recent months, forging a close relationship with the US president, Donald Trump, including through rounds of golf. The personal connection has meant that Finland, with a population of just 5.6 million, has been able to play an outsized role in communications between Trump and European leaders. Stubb said he and Trump are still in contact regularly, \u201cby phone and other means\u201d and that he expects the pair to have a bilateral meeting this week.\n\nStubb has said on several occasions this year that the US president was beginning to lose patience with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, but so far Trump\u2019s occasional tough words on Putin have not translated into action, and a series of Trump-set deadlines for progress to be made on arriving at a peace deal have passed without much follow-up. Instead, Trump rolled out the red carpet for Putin in Alaska last month.\n\nStubb said he thought progress was being made, but \u201cit\u2019s not a big bazooka, it\u2019s step-by-step\u201d. On the question of whether there is a point when Europe has to accept that the US is not a reliable ally when it comes to Ukraine negotiations, Stubb said his nation had little option but to try as hard as possible to be friendly with the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the job of the president of Finland to get along with the president of the United States, whoever he is,\u201d said Stubb. \u201cForeign policy is always based on three pillars. It\u2019s values, interests and power. Small states only have values and interests \u2026 but we can have influence instead of power. Engagement is better than disengagement, come hell or high water,\u201d he added.\n\nLast week, Stubb was in Kyiv where he met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and said he came away from the trip \u201cconfident\u201d that Ukraine could continue fighting a long war if necessary, dismissing suggestions to the contrary as \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\nStubb said much of the focus at the UN this week will be on Palestine, but that he hopes to have several meetings with Zelenskyy and others related to Ukraine. On security guarantees, he said an \u201cAmerican backstop\u201d would be necessary to give them real force, and conceded that there is not yet a full sense of what the Trump administration is willing to commit.\n\nHowever, the talk of guarantees may all be purely hypothetical if progress is not made first on a negotiated end to the war. Zelenskyy has said many times he is willing to meet Putin, as demanded by Trump, but Putin has said he would only meet Zelenskyy in Moscow, or if numerous Russian demands are met first.\n\nStubb conceded that there did not currently appear much chance of bringing Putin to the table. \u201cThis war is too big for him to lose. He has made probably the biggest strategic mistake in recent history, certainly since the end of the cold war, and he has failed in all of his strategic aims. It\u2019s a question when he comes to the negotiating table, hopefully sooner rather than later, but right now I\u2019m quite pessimistic,\u201d said Stubb."

                "text": "Both 28 Years Later and 28 Days Later are now streaming on Netflix, so there goes all your plans to be productive this weekend.\n\nDirected by the OG team director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland, 28 Years Later picks up\u2014as the title suggests\u201428 years after the 2007 movie 28 Weeks Later, aka the sequel to the 2002 movie 28 Days Later. The third movie in the franchise finds survivors of the Rage virus epidemic living a new way of life, trying to stay alive while avoiding the infected. 28 Years Later features a new cast, led by star Jodie Comer, who plays a woman named Isla who suffers from memory loss. Her husband Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is a scavenger trying to keep both them and their 12-year-old son Spike alive.\n\nAfter you finish watching 28 Years Later on Netflix, you\u2019ll be banging at the studio\u2019s door for part two. Lucky for you, part two\u2014aka 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u2014has already been filmed and has a release date. Read on to learn more about when the 28 Years Later sequel movie comes out in movie theaters, and when we expect to see 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple streaming on Netflix.\n\nWhen does 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple come out?\n\n28 Years Later: The Bone Temple is scheduled to be released in movie theaters on January 16, 2026. Both the 28 Years Later movie and the 28 Years Later sequel movie were filmed back-to-back in the summer of 2024, which means 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple has already been filmed. There\u2019s already a trailer, poster, and everything!\n\nDirector Nia DaCosta takes the reigns for Part 2, taking over from director Danny Boyle. Alex Garland, who also wrote 28 Years Later and 28 Days Later, wrote the script. The story picks up after the events of the first film, and follows Jamie\u2019s son Spike (Alfie Williams) as he joins the cult of survivors led by Sir Jimmy Crystal (Jack O\u2019Connell). At the same time, fellow survivor and former doctor Dr Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes) discovers something that, if you can believe it, might make this zombie apocalypse situation even worse.\n\nWhen will 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple be streaming on Netflix?\n\n28 Years Later: The Bone Temple will open in theaters only first, but it will eventually stream on Netflix, too. Netflix has a deal with Sony Pictures that gives the streamer the rights to the Sony movies in the \u201cPay 1\u201d window, meaning the first streaming window after the film\u2019s home media release.\n\nBecause 28 Years Later came to Netflix about three months after opening in theaters, it seems safe to assume you will see 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple on Netflix about three months after it opens in theaters, too. That means you\u2019ll probably see 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple on Netflix around mid-April 2026."

The charity event will support Van Der Beek, 48, who announced in 2024 that he was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer.\n\n\u201cIt was just about ready to break out of the wall,\u201d Humes told Us Weekly in an interview published Tuesday. \u201cIt could\u2019ve been a terrible situation, but we caught it in time. My doctor said we dodged a bullet, and it was all because of early detection.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cCancers are survivable, but go out and get screened. Thankfully, that\u2019s part of James\u2019 journey.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMotocrossed\u201d alum and the \u201cVarsity Blues\u201d star have had many talks since his diagnosis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had multiple conversations that are very uplifting and spiritual,\u201d Humes continued. \u201cHe knows I\u2019ve got his back 100 percent. He\u2019s going to get through this, and we\u2019re all coming together.\u201d\n\nDuring the benefit, Humes, Van Der Beek, Katie Holmes, Michelle Williams, Busy Philipps, Joshua Jackson, Mary Beth Peil, John Wesley Shipp, Nina Repeta, Kerr Smith, and Meredith Monroe will do a live reading of the show\u2019s pilot episode.\n\n\u201cIt was a way for us to actually have a reunion, all of us together, and celebrate James\u2019 life,\u201d Humes explained to the outlet. \u201cBecause he\u2019s dealing with a very difficult situation; very optimistic, but a difficult situation. Together as a TV family, we just thought we needed to be there for him and rally around him.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d alum Jason Moore is also set to direct and produce the show.\n\nThe 54-year-old will produce the reading alongside Williams, 45, her husband Thomas Kail, the show\u2019s creator Kevin Williamson, Carl Ogawa, Maggie Brohn, and Greg Berlanti.\n\nPhilipps, 46, Smith, 53, and Monroe, 55, joined the series after Season 1 and will read various parts from the show\u2019s pilot.\n\nWilliamson, 60, previously said about the reunion: \u201cI am so excited to reunite with James, Michelle, Katie, Joshua, and our \u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 family for such a special night.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 changed my life,\u201d the creator gushed. \u201cWhat began as a personal story about a young man and his friends navigating their way through the challenges of life became so much more than I ever dreamed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt created an enduring fandom and legacy all over the world. I am so honored to be a part of it and to support our beautiful friend, James, as we continue to navigate our way through life and its many challenges,\u201d Williamson concluded.\n\nWilliams also shared her own sentiments about the special night.\n\n\u201cWe grew up in Capeside and that\u2019s a bond that will last a lifetime,\u201d the actress detailed. \u201cWe wanted to gather around our dear friend James and remind him that we are all here. We always have been and we always will be. And I know the fans of \u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 feel the same way.\u201d\n\nThe beloved series quickly rose to peak popularity after hitting the airwaves in the late \u201990s.\n\nFans followed Joey (Holmes) as she navigated school after the death of her mother and juggled a love triangle with Dawson (Van Der Beek) and best friend Pacey (Jackson).\n\nIn July, viewers were sent into a frenzy after Holmes, 46, and Jackson, 47, reunited for an upcoming project.\n\nThe duo was spotted walking down a street in New York City.\n\nHolmes later revealed on Instagram that they teamed up for \u201cHappy Hours,\u201d a new feature film trilogy she is set to write, direct and star in.\n\n\u201cI am so very grateful to be working again with so many of my wonderful friends on this film HAPPY HOURS,\u201d she teased. \u201cAnd working with Josh after so many years is a testament to friendship.\u201d\n\n\u201cHAPPY HOURS is a love story that includes so many people I adore. We can\u2019t wait for everyone to see what we make.\u201d\n\nWhile the gang is finding their way back together, in March, Van Der Beek confessed he didn\u2019t speak to his co-stars for years following the end of the series.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten in touch with them recently and it\u2019s just been so nice,\u201d he admitted while on Jana Kramer\u2018s \u201cWhine Down\u201d podcast.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been so great to talk to them and catch up with like who they are now this many years out and to have that shared experience from back in the day,\u201d expressed Van Der Beek. \u201cIt\u2019s just so lovely every time I get to catch up with one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all went our separate ways and just didn\u2019t speak for years because we were just living our lives and doing our things,\u201d the actor added. \u201cAnd to just kind of reconnect and be like, \u2018Oh, wow, I love who you\u2019ve become.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite paving his own career in the early 2000s, Van Der Beek doesn\u2019t mind reminiscing.\n\n\u201cI have such a nostalgia for it,\u201d he gushed. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s just time or what, but yeah.\u201d\n\nThree months later, Williamson chimed in on the possibility of a reboot.\n\n\u201cNot in television form. I think there\u2019s other ways that [a \u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 revival] can come to fruition,\u201d he admitted to The Post. \u201cBut I\u2019m not so sure\u2026 I feel complete. I feel like we told the story.\u201d"

It lunged at shoppers and pets, raising fears that the animal was sick, according to CBS News.\n\nIn a video filmed by local real estate agent Sean F. Clarkin, the 175-pound female bear walks through the store as everyone looks on, terrified.\n\nClarkin, who tried to guide the bear out of the store, could be heard nervously talking to the animal, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, buddy? You are one big, nasty motherf\u2014-r.\u201d As the bear approached him, Clarkin\u2019s voice grew increasingly frantic, \u201cWhere the f\u2013k is the door?\u201d\n\nThe bear had already bitten an elderly woman in the leg before Clarkin began filming. The woman was rushed to the hospital, and reports later confirmed the bear had also attacked a local\u2019s dog.\n\nDespite efforts by police to corral the bear back into the woods using rubber bullets, the animal kept returning to the store, prompting authorities to make the decision to shoot it.\n\nChristine Flohr, who works at a nearby business, witnessed the bear\u2019s death and was overcome with emotion.\n\n\u201cMy heart just sank. I got tears in my eyes. I\u2019m tearing up now just thinking about it.

But moments later, as the bear\u2019s demeanor shifted, Clarkin shouted, \u201cGet away! Get the f\u2013k away! Move!\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Division is now investigating the incident.\n\nClarkin later posted a statement on social media, calling attention to the root cause of such encounters \u2014 unsecured dumpsters.\n\n\u201cAfter years \u2014 decades \u2014 of the municipality allowing restaurant and business dumpsters to remain open and unsecured, we\u2019re now witnessing the consequences,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhen bears have easy access to human food, their population grows rapidly, leading to unnecessary annual hunts. If we reduce access to dumpster food, we\u2019ll see a natural decline in bear populations and, in turn, less need for these hunts.\u201d\n\nAs officials continue their investigation, the unsettling incident highlights growing concerns over human-wildlife conflicts in suburban areas."

It would only apply to new requests, but companies would have to pay the same amount for each applicant for six years, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.\n\n\"The company needs to decide... is the person valuable enough to have a $100,000-a-year payment to the government, or they should head home, and they should go hire an American,\" he said, adding: \"All of the big companies are on board.\"\n\nSince 2004, the number of H-1B applications has been capped at 85,000 per year.\n\nUntil now, H-1B visas have carried various administrative fees totalling around $1,500.\n\nData from US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) shows that applications for H-1B visas for the next fiscal year fell to about 359,000 - a four-year low.\n\nThe greatest beneficiary of the programme the previous fiscal year was Amazon, followed by tech giants Tata, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google, according to government statistics.\n\nLate on Friday, Amazon told employees with H-1B visas who were already in the US to remain there.\n\nAccording to an internal advisory, seen by Business Insider, the company said those abroad should \"try to return before tomorrow's deadline if possible\".\n\nAnyone unable to make it back before the order takes effect should avoid attempting US re-entry \"until further guidance is provided\", the company is also quoted as saying.\n\nMeanwhile, India's leading trade body Nasscom said it was concerned by the edict - and that the one-day deadline created \"considerable uncertainty for businesses, professionals, and students across the world\".\n\nIndia was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71% of approved applications, Reuters news agency reports, citing government data.\n\nChina was said to come in second at 11.7%.\n\nTahmina Watson, a founding attorney at Watson Immigration Law, told the BBC that the ruling could be a \"nail in the coffin\" for many of her clients that are mostly small businesses and start-ups.\n\n\"Almost everyone's going to be priced out. This $100,000 as an entry point is going to have a devastating impact,\" she added, noting that many small or medium-sized companies \"will tell you they actually can't find workers to do the job\".\n\n\"When employers sponsor foreign talent, more often than not, they're doing that because they have not been able to fulfil those positions,\" Ms Watson added.\n\nJorge Lopez, the chair of the immigration and global mobility practice group at Littler Mendelson PC, said a $100,000 fee \"will put the brakes on American competitiveness in the tech sector and all industries\".\n\nSome companies might consider setting up operations outside the US, though doing so can be challenging in practice, he added.\n\nThe debate over H-1Bs had previously caused splits within Trump's team and supporters, pitting those in favour of the visas against critics such as former strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nTrump told reporters at the White House in January that he understands \"both sides of the argument\" on H-1Bs.\n\nThe year before - while seeking to attract support from the tech industry while on the campaign trail - Trump vowed to make the process of attracting talent easier, going as far as to propose green cards for college graduates.\n\n\"You need a pool of people to work for companies,\" he told the All-In Podcast. \"You have to be able to recruit these people and keep these people.\"\n\nEarly in his first term in 2017, Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B applications, seeking to improve fraud detection.\n\nRejections rose to an all-time high of 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared to between 5% and 8% under Barack Obama and then between 2% and 4% under Joe Biden.\n\nAt the time, tech companies pushed back, criticising the Trump administration's H-1B order."

However, such a prohibitive fee will likely vastly transform the H-1B system, which was created in 1990 and awards 85,000 visas per year on a lottery system.\n\nSupporters of the H-1B programme say it brings the best and brightest to work in the US, creating an edge against foreign competitors. Critics have long charged that companies have abused the programme, using it to pay lower wages and to impose fewer labour protections.\n\nTech entrepreneurs \u2013 including Trump\u2019s former ally Elon Musk \u2013 have warned against targeting H-1B visas, saying that the US does not have enough homegrown talent to fill important tech sector job vacancies.\n\nHowever, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said: \u201cAll the big companies are on board.\u201d\n\nGeographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nSome analysts suggested the fee may force companies to move some high-value work overseas, hampering the US\u2019s position in the high-stakes artificial intelligence race with China, which at 11.7 percent of total H-1B visas ranks a distant second, according to government data.\n\nFollowing the White House\u2019s announcement, major US tech firms Microsoft, JPMorgan and Amazon advised employees holding H-1B visas to remain in the US, according to internal emails reviewed by the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe new fee marks the Trump administration\u2019s most high-profile attempt to overhaul the country\u2019s temporary employment visa system. Since taking office in January, he has launched a broad crackdown on immigration, including efforts to limit certain forms of undocumented immigration.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry on Saturday said its officials would \u201ccomprehensively assess the impact of these measures on the advancement of [South Korean] companies and professional talents into the US market and engage in necessary communication with the US\u201d.\n\nHundreds of South Koreans were detained during a US immigration raid on a Hyundai-LG battery factory site in the state of Georgia this month."

                "text": "Donald Trump said on Friday that he and Xi Jinping had agreed to approve a deal over TikTok.\n\n\u201cHe approved the TikTok deal,\u201d Trump said about Xi to reporters in the Oval Office, suggesting the leaders signed off on a preliminary agreement. But Trump offered no details about the agreement or when it would be signed.\n\nThe American and Chinese leaders had connected over a phone call earlier in the day, the first direct contact between the two leaders since June. China and the US have been at loggerheads over trade negotiations and the future of TikTok, a Chinese-owned social media platform that faces a ban in the US.\n\nTrump had said earlier this week that Washington and Beijing had agreed a deal on TikTok under which it would be transferred to US control, but details of the framework have been scant, and elements reportedly remain to be hashed out. Investors including the US software giant Oracle have been in talks to take a large stake in TikTok\u2019s US operations, which would dilute the amount of China-based ownership to comply with a law Congress passed last year.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that investors in the TikTok deal would pay the US a fee in exchange for negotiating the agreement with China.\n\nIn the call on Friday, the Chinese president \u201cemphasised the vital importance of US-China relations\u201d, according to a Chinese readout of Friday\u2019s phone call.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s position on the TikTok issue is clear,\u201d the readout said. \u201cThe Chinese government respects the wishes of companies and welcomes them to conduct commercial negotiations based on market rules and reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance interests. China hopes that the US will provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies to invest in the US.\u201d\n\nChina described the call as \u201cpragmatic, positive, and constructive\u201d.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump described the call as \u201cvery productive\u201d. \u201cWe made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nHe said he and Xi would meet at the Asia-Pacificeconomic cooperation summit in South Korea in late October and he would visit China \u201cin the early part of next year\u201d. China has not commented on when Trump and Xi might meet in person.\n\nThe TikTok deal was negotiated this week in Madrid, where the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and the Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng met to negotiate a trade deal. The US and China have agreed to a temporary pause in the trade war and the deadline to reach an agreement is 10 November.\n\nThe call came as Trump returned from a state visit to the UK, which was accompanied by news of a multibillion-dollar investment deal for US tech companies in the UK. Microsoft will invest $30bn while Nvidia will invest \u00a311bn.\n\nUS tech companies have been caught in the cross-hairs of the US-China trade war. This week it was reported that China had ordered its top tech firms to stop buying semiconductors from Nvidia, which makes the world\u2019s most advanced chips. Nvidia\u2019s most high-end models are already banned by the US from being exported to China, but it had developed less sophisticated chips specifically for the Chinese market.\n\nThe Chinese readout of the call said Trump had praised Beijing\u2019s recent military parade \u2013 the biggest showcase of military might in decades \u2013 as \u201cmagnificent\u201d. The second world war commemoration parade, which was attended by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, was widely seen in the west as being a show of unity from an anti-American bloc.\n\nHowever, China has been keen to stress its cooperation with the allied forces in the second world war. According to the readout, Xi on Friday \u201cpointed out that China and the United States were allies who fought side by side during world war two\u201d.\n\nChina described US-China ties as \u201cthe most important bilateral relationship in the world\u201d."

Despite a law mandating TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest a significant stake, the legality of the proposed deal remains uncertain, and there has been minimal political pushback against Trump's disregard for the ban. The situation underscores a broader issue of executive overreach and the failure of Congress to enforce laws, raising concerns about the implications for governance and national security.",
                "source": "Politico - Congress",
                "text": "On Friday, Trump is set to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping to agree to the terms of a proposed deal that is supposed to finally end the TikTok drama and bring all parties into compliance with the law. The deal reportedly involves some sort of sale to a consortium of investors that may include Trump allies and billionaires like Larry Ellison and Marc Andreessen, though the structure and legality of the agreement remain unclear. Indeed, whatever happens Friday is not likely to end the matter.\n\nThe law passed by Congress and signed into law under Joe Biden requires TikTok\u2019s Beijing-based parent company ByteDance to divest at least 80 percent of its financial stake in the company and also precludes \u201cany cooperation\u201d concerning \u201cthe operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.\u201d Earlier this week, however, a Chinese cybersecurity official said that the framework includes \u201clicensing the [TikTok] algorithm and other intellectual property rights.\u201d Depending on the specifics, that licensing arrangement, with its \u201clethal algorithm\u201d intact, could run afoul of the law. What then?\n\nSome Republican China hawks on Capitol Hill insisted this week that they will closely scrutinize the deal when the terms become clearer, but there has been almost no pushback from Republicans over Trump\u2019s decision to unilaterally ignore the TikTok ban all year \u2014 and far less from Democrats than one might have expected.\n\nCotton did not respond to a request for comment about Trump\u2019s continuing refusal to enforce the law, despite being a once-voluble critic of TikTok and the Chinese government\u2019s control of the app and arguing that the app has already \u201ccost the lives of many American kids.\u201d\n\nA representative for Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri told me that if I wanted to hear from him on the matter, I was free to track him down in the Capitol. Hawley previously defended the ban and warned of the dangers of TikTok in January, shortly before Trump returned to office and announced that the administration would simply ignore it. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a national security threat,\u201d Hawley said of TikTok at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal security threat.\u201d\n\nTrump himself once shared these concerns. In 2020, he signed an executive order declaring that TikTok\u2019s data collection \u201cthreatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans\u2019 personal and proprietary information \u2014 potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, was before Trump courted a billionaire donor with a stake in TikTok and before Trump decided that TikTok had helped him win his 2024 reelection bid. Last month, the White House created an official TikTok account \u2014 a further sign, if one was needed, of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing disregard for the ban passed by Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has benefited from an apparent lack of coordination and urgency on the Democratic side of the aisle.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted for the ban but later opposed immediate implementation of the law in January and endorsed a legislative extension before the law went into effect. That did not pass, but Trump has kept TikTok alive anyway without apparent legal authority to do so. Schumer did not respond to a request for comment on Trump\u2019s series of TikTok executive orders this year.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, for his part, opposed the TikTok ban in the first place but said that he is waiting to see more about the deal before rendering a final opinion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working to make sure this deal does not lead to the censorship of free speech and will protect the millions of content creators who rely on TikTok,\u201d he told POLITICO Magazine.\n\nThe whole situation has no apparent precedent in the annals of American law.\n\nSure, there are lots of laws on the books, and the federal government cannot enforce them all. That is why federal law enforcement relies heavily on priority-setting and careful attention to the opportunity costs of pursuing some crimes over others.\n\nThe Trump administration has made its agenda clear, and the ramifications have not been surprising. If, for example, you insist that federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors focus almost entirely on illegal immigration, then you are going to have fewer investigations and prosecutions for white-collar crime and financial fraud \u2014 which is exactly what is happening now.\n\nIn February, Trump announced that he was \u201cpausing\u201d enforcement of the foreign anti-bribery statute \u2014 a law that he notoriously hates \u2014 and in June, the Justice Department issued a memo that dramatically narrowed the circumstances under which the administration would enforce the law. In less overt fashion, the Justice Department has also significantly de-prioritized public corruption investigations, which Trump also hates.\n\nReasonable minds can often disagree about which federal laws merit the Justice Department\u2019s focus at any given point in time, but the TikTok ban stands apart both for its public and political salience, as well as its simplicity.\n\nThe law passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress and was unanimously affirmed on constitutional grounds by the Supreme Court. In the wake of the murder of Charlie Kirk, the country is also now engaged in a national, rolling public debate about the polarizing and radicalizing dangers of social media, particularly on America\u2019s youth.\n\nThe TikTok ban is also not subtle or particularly complicated to implement. It states that the Justice Department \u201cshall conduct investigations related to potential violations\u201d of the ban by tech companies, including third-party service providers, and that the Justice Department \u201cshall pursue enforcement\u201d if a violation has occurred. The fines that are supposed to apply are massive, potentially adding up to billions of dollars.\n\nInstead of abiding by this provision, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote letters to Apple, Google and other tech companies earlier this year informing them that she was effectively immunizing them for any violations of the law. She argued that enforcing the ban would \u201cinterfere with the execution of the President\u2019s constitutional duties to take care of the national security and foreign affairs of the United States.\u201d\n\nLeft unsaid was how this decision would comply with the president\u2019s constitutional obligation to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\u201d how it could be squared with Congress\u2019 constitutional lawmaking authority, or why we should all be okay with the administration unilaterally disregarding the American public\u2019s interest in having the executive branch enforce the laws passed by their elected representatives.\n\nThe TikTok ban may or may not be good on the merits. You may hate it or you may love it, but it is the law of the land \u2014 and it has been all year.\n\nIf the ban was a bad idea, then Congress could have repealed the law or passed a legislative extension, but neither of those things has happened. Instead, pretty much every politician in Washington \u2014 on both sides of the aisle \u2014 has effectively decided that the law can be flagrantly ignored because of TikTok\u2019s popularity and the potential electoral fallout that could result from antagonizing the app\u2019s relatively young user base.\n\nThis is not how laws are supposed to work in this country.\n\nCongress is supposed to pass them, and the president is supposed to enforce them. There are no constitutional carve-outs for popular social media apps or for companies that helped you win your election.\n\nOver the last eight months, the Trump administration has run roughshod over Congress and its constitutional prerogatives. Trump\u2019s decision to ignore the TikTok ban on his first day in office may seem minor in the grand scheme of things, but it foreshadowed a series of far more aggressive moves to usurp much of lawmakers\u2019 constitutional authority: dismantling congressionally-created agencies, redirecting congressionally appropriated funds and implementing a massive tax hike on the American public in the form of Trump\u2019s chaotic tariff regime.\n\nThe vast majority of this was made possible by congressional Republicans, who have largely turned a blind eye to all of Trump\u2019s gambits, and by the Republican appointees on the Supreme Court, who have handed Trump a series of victories this year in his wide-ranging efforts to both unilaterally slash the federal government while dramatically expanding the powers of the presidency.\n\nThe acquiescence to Trump\u2019s TikTok reprieve this year has been a far more bipartisan affair, but it has been a constitutional farce all the same, and it is not over yet."

We now see this playbook being used by activist attorneys to systematically block key elements of the Trump agenda from being enacted \u2013 all while collecting big legal fees.\n\nMost recently, lawfare has come for an executive order Trump signed in August that aims to democratize access to alternative assets in 401(k) plans. The EO aims to allow the 90 million-plus everyday Americans who save for retirement through traditional 401(k) plans to invest in assets typically reserved for the wealthy and well-connected - namely, private equity and cryptocurrencies. These investments have regularly outperformed the public stock market and help diversify investors\u2019 portfolios, which many believe are too heavily exposed to the \"Magnificent 7\" Big Tech stocks. This is why major investors like large state pension funds tend to hold around one-third of their assets in private market investments.\n\nThe order directs the Department of Labor (DOL) to reexamine fiduciary duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and propose rules that could include a legal safe harbor for plan sponsors choosing to include high-quality alternative investment options. A few days later, the DOL rescinded Biden-era language that had discouraged such options, opening the door for American savers to these asset classes, which are typically limited to so-called \"accredited investors,\" with high income and net worth.\n\nYet trial lawyers are already plotting lawsuits to cancel this reform before it can start, and aim to win a big payday in doing so. As a prominent plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer stated recently to Bloomberg Law: \"I would joke and say that I hope employers add alternative investments, because I have some kids I need to put through college.\" Indeed, unless the Trump administration insists on strong rulemaking and clear safe harbor in place, these lawyers plan to use the court system to extract multimillion dollar settlements that benefit themselves, while denying average Americans the wealth-building tools that have long been reserved for the elite.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\n\nOn energy, President Trump made a decisive move with his executive order unleashing American energy, encouraging exploration on federal lands, eliminating burdensome electric vehicle mandates, revoking outdated climate-related directives, and streamlining permitting processes. Yet, environmental trial lawyers have mounted a fierce counteroffensive, using lawfare to hold up these vital changes, resulting in delays that keep energy prices higher, stifle job growth in America\u2019s heartland, and prolong reliance on America\u2019s adversaries for energy resources.\n\nThe pattern continues with Trump\u2019s drive for a smaller, more efficient federal workforce. In March, he signed an executive order to address workforce efficiency, instructing agencies to terminate collective bargaining agreements - some of which were signed in the final days of the Biden Administration to hamstring President Trump. Labor union lawyers have deployed lawfare to preserve the entrenched system and challenge the order in multiple federal courts, securing court stays. Their efforts delay essential efficiencies, perpetuating a bloated federal workforce that drains taxpayer dollars and slows government responsiveness.\n\nThis well-coordinated effort shows the threat to Trump\u2019s agenda from those trying using the courts to override the will of the American voter. These trial lawyers, motivated by both ideology and profit, seek to accomplish through the courts what they couldn\u2019t in the 2024 election: Stop Trump at any cost. Our movement\u2019s challenge is to fight back, reclaiming policy-making from the courts and restore it to the people\u2019s representatives."

                "source": "NYPost",
                "text": "The Jewish vote will be NYC Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 secret weapon to become the \u2018Chosen\u2019 candidate and pull off an upset victory in November \u2013 despite a new poll indicating otherwise, Hizzoner predicted in an exclusive sit-down this week, excerpted below, with The Post\u2019s Rich Calder in Gracie Mansion.\n\nDuring the 20-minute, wide-ranging interview, long-shot Adams said a Marist University poll released Tuesday showing him having just 17% support in the race from Jewish voters is hogwash.\n\nThe embattled mayor said he hasn\u2019t received, doesn\u2019t expect, and doesn\u2019t want help in the race from President Trump.\n\nThe moderate Democrat boasted about how his administration drove down crime and helped bring New York out of the pandemic, but admitted to making plenty of mistakes \u2014 including having poor judgment backing key hires that spurred a now-closed federal corruption probe and allegations of the NYPD being run like a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d\n\nHe insisted his rival, socialist frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, is a phony who \u201cmastered the art of saying anything\u201d \u2014 including lies \u2014 to win over voters.\n\nQ: There\u2019s been reports you are dropping out of the race, which your camp has denied. Do you commit to being in this race and campaigning until the end, and is there anything that would change it?\n\nA: That\u2019s my desire, and I\u2019ve tried to be as communicative as possible. I was just talking about the assassination [of conservative pundit Charlie Kirk] that took place a few days ago. Tomorrow\u2019s not a promise to us, you know. I can only tell you my desire. My desire right now is not to see our city go in the wrong direction and to continue this run. And I\u2019ve stated it over and over again. People say, well, you know, you were offered the job as ambassador [to Saudi Arabia]. That\u2019s just not true. I was not offered to go to HUD. That\u2019s not true. I didn\u2019t go to Yankee Stadium to meet with Donald Trump. That\u2019s not true. So, no matter what I say, it seems like in the universe people have made up their opinions. So all I can say is my desire, as we sit here today, is to run until November 4th.\n\nQ: Polls . . . have you ranked fourth. Why do you feel that\u2019s the case? What can you do over the next six weeks to change that?\n\nA: Polls change often \u2026 I think about Mark Green and Michael Bloomberg. I think Mark was up 14 points [in the 2001 mayoral race, but he lost to Bloomberg]. I think about my [2021 race], being in third place. I think about where Andrew Cuomo was [in the Democratic primary]; 87% of the polymarketers had him winning the race \u2026 So these polls change.\n\nI was at an event the other day. I had a fundraiser, and the person said, \u2018They told me you are taking the job in Saudi Arabia.\u2019 All of this noise out there has really eroded the facts. Now, if we just focus on the policies, people won\u2019t have that assumption. So I think how I\u2019ve been covered, which is really unique in comparison to all the other candidates, I think it has really become a sixth opponent. You know, I\u2019m not only running against the people who are running. I\u2019m running against this other noise that\u2019s out there.\n\nQ: Can you clarify? I covered Bill de Blasio\u2019s time as NYC mayor. The Post and other media outlets were critical of him.\n\nA: Yeah, [they\u2019re] supposed to be.\n\nQ: So what do you think is different between you and de Blasio?\n\nA: I think it\u2019s totally different. When I\u2019m out in the streets . . . \u2018Eric, you\u2019re leaving to go to Saudi Arabia.\u2019 The public is reading that. The public is not going in depth. When they hear over and over again, it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that Eric is no longer in the race, that\u2019s going to impact them. That\u2019s No. 1. Number 2: I never had a chance to get my message out. \u2026The CFB [Campaign Finance Board] is controlling who the voters can vote for and whose message they\u2019re going to hear. That\u2019s just not how the system should work \u2026 Four million in [anticipated public matching funds] is lost. \u2026That\u2019s money that\u2019s used to get your message out. That\u2019s how you win races \u2014 when people can get your message out. My message has never been told.\u201d\n\nQ: Why do you think you\u2019re polling behind Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani with Jewish voters right now? That is supposed to be one of your stronger bases.\n\nA: Let\u2019s be clear on something: polls normally go to \u2018likely voters.\u2019 I think this is going to be the highest election [turnout] in probably the history of the city. I think we could get up to 2 million people to come out to vote, and many of them are going to be Jewish voters. I hear from some of my Yeshivas that are now telling their parents when you drop your child off to register for school, you have to fill out this voter registration form. And so these are new voters; these are first-time voters, and I think there\u2019s a population of voters that no one is polling \u2014 like they missed . . . those young voters that came out [for Mamdani] in the primary. And so I believe I\u2019m going to get the overwhelming number of Jewish votes. They supported me as senator, [Brooklyn] borough president, and mayor. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change.\n\nQ: Is there anything that as mayor that you can do [to make Jews feel safer]?\n\nA: Yeah, we have. We were very clear on many levels, but one specifically with the Jewish community. . . . We put in place a Mayor\u2019s Office to [Combat] Antisemitism. We focused on ridding our city of hate, what we\u2019re doing over at the [NYPD] hate crimes unit, and then we send the large national message. You know, for someone to state that a national, international leader comes to our country, and you\u2019re gonna arrest them [referring to Mamdani saying he will direct the NYPD, if mayor, to arrest Israel Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he visits NYC]? First of all, you don\u2019t understand the laws. Diplomatic immunity is in place. You don\u2019t have the authority to do so, but the symbol you\u2019re sending out; you\u2019re sending out that hate \u2026 He didn\u2019t say that to the leader of Sudan, where you\u2019re seeing real wars, or Yemen. No, he targeted a group \u2013 [after] being unwilling to say it was wrong to say \u2018Globalize the Intifada.\u2019 You know, this stuff starts to add up, and it\u2019s no longer coded messages. It\u2019s clear messages. And if you are a Jewish resident, you have to be alarmed by some of these positions.\n\nQ: There\u2019s been multiple corruption allegations swirling around your office the past three years \u2013 including the since-dropped federal indictment involving your campaign, and former Police Commissioner Thomas Donlan claiming you had him run the NYPD like a criminal enterprise. What is your message to voters who have serious concerns about this?\n\nA: Listen, we make mistakes. I say it over and over again: 65 years of living; you make a ton of mistakes in 65 years (laughing). There are things you want to do differently. There\u2019s things that you would probably say, \u2018maybe I should have brought on this person to handle the job\u2019. That\u2019s it. All I can tell voters is, \u2018Listen, sorry for any inconvenience, sorry for the distractions, but I never stopped working for voters.\u2019 We preserved, built, and zoned our city for more housing than 12 years of Bloomberg, eight years of de Blasio combined, in three-and-a-half years. What we\u2019ve done in crime . . . safest big city in America. What we\u2019ve done for low-income New Yorkers \u2014 we put $30 billion back in the pockets of New Yorkers. People are talking about affordability. We made it happen from no income tax for low-income New Yorkers paying off medical debt; all of these things that we have done. And so what I want New Yorkers to do, what I\u2019ve never had an opportunity to do is tell New Yorkers, \u2018Yes, here\u2019s mistakes I made, but look at what I\u2019ve done for our city.\u2019 I got us out of COVID; 237,000 migrants in asylum seekers, overproliferation of guns. We took almost 24,000 off our streets. I delivered for New Yorkers, in spite of all the things that were happening around me, and in fact, I never broke a law. I never did anything that violated my oath of office. And anyone who read that indictment, even scholars, walked away saying, \u2018What the heck is this?\u2019 A sitting mayor of New York? You\u2019re going to indict him and put him in jail for 33 years for leg room and calling the Fire Department?\n\nQ: What do you consider other big successes of your administration?\n\nA: Universal after-school program, so important. First time ever \u2014 100,000 summer youth jobs was crucial. High speed broadband in NYCHA for free, so they could do telemedicine and remote learning. Paying the college tuition for foster care children. As I say to build more housing \u2026 More jobs in New York in the history of the city. More small businesses are operating in the history of the city. When you start to look at how we turned around the economy, brought down crime, cleaned the city, even my favorite topic: rats, rat complaints are down \u2026 This city is not coming back. The city is back.\n\nQ: What do you consider the biggest failures?\n\nA: Ah, man. Any shooting is shooting too much. You know, I think that we want to continue to drive down crime, and really, probably controlling some of the noise that has been released from the office, you know? New Yorkers don\u2019t need distraction when they\u2019re moving forward and their lives.\n\nQ: Since winning the primary, Mamdani has backtracked on previous lefty stances he took, including supporting the Defund the Police movement. Do you think . . . New Yorkers should believe him when he claims he\u2019ll back off such stances?\n\nA: He has mastered the art of saying anything that needs to be said to be \u2026 elected. That is what he is doing \u2026 First of all, academically, he\u2019s a smart person. So when you know you can\u2019t do the things you\u2019re promising, then you\u2019re hurting people who are going to be looking for that relief. He knows he can\u2019t decrease rent in NYCHA, in Mitchell-Lama [housing], in any building where your subsidies are based on your income. He knows that. He knows he can\u2019t give people free buses because of the price tag of $3 billion. He knows that. He knows that it\u2019s wrong to remove 3,000 people from Rikers Island, the most dangerous people we have in our city, without it harming the communities they\u2019re going to go back into and prey on. Like, he knows this, but he\u2019s doing it anyway, because it\u2019s about he just wants to get elected.\n\nQ: President Trump recently said he\u2019s resigned to the idea that Mamdani will be New York City\u2019s next mayor? How does that make you feel?\n\nA: It doesn\u2019t make me feel at all. When you go back, during the [Democratic] primary \u2026how many people were resigned to Cuomo being mayor when he was 36 points up in the poll? It was a foregone conclusion \u2026 Everyone felt we were just going through the motions. That\u2019s just not how life is.\n\nQ: The time we spoke in July you said the president had not offered to help your campaign. Since then, have you spoken?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Are you expecting any type of assistance from the president or his camp? Are you upset you haven\u2019t gotten any yet?\n\nA: I am not upset at all. It is my job to get re-elected. It is not the obligation or the responsibility of the president. It\u2019s my job. I have to convince voters, so there\u2019s no anger or upset at all.\n\nQ: Do you think Trump or the Republican Party in general is quietly hoping Mamdani wins so it can use mistakes they believe he\u2019ll make as mayor as a rallying cry for Republicans to win future elections?\n\nA: I don\u2019t think so. New York is too important to the country. The way goes New York goes America, and so I don\u2019t think they want our country to go backwards.\n\nQ: Did you think Gov. Hochul\u2019s endorsement of Mamdani will lead to the White House punishing New York in any way?\n\nA: I would hope not, and I don\u2019t think so. Again, New York is important to the country.\n\nQ: On the ballot, you\u2019ve listed your name as an independent under the \u201cSafe&Affordable/EndAntiSemitism\u201d line. That\u2019s a lot of words. Any concern it confuses voters?\n\nA: No (laughing).\n\nQ: If you were not seeking re-election and went to the polls and saw Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, Mamdani and Cuomo on the mayoral ballot, who would you vote for?\n\nA: I would write in Eric Adams (laughing).\n\nQ: Let\u2019s go . . . beyond elections. You kept the Bronx casino plan alive with a key veto in July. Assuming existing racinos win two of the three downstate casino bids as many assume, do you think the Bronx site is the most viable site downstate, or are there others you prefer?\n\nA: I think all of them should be considered. I did not want to take the Bronx out of play. That was wrong. If they would have done that to the Manhattan site, or any other site, the Queens site or the Brooklyn site, I would have done the same thing. It\u2019s wrong to allow one council person to take what\u2019s going to impact that entire borough.\n\nQ: Nine months later, any regrets about congestion pricing?\n\nA: I haven\u2019t got a report of all the numbers. I still say that we should look at some waivers from some groups of New Yorkers, but we haven\u2019t looked at the numbers yet.\n\nQ: There\u2019s a new City Council bill introduced by James Gennaro (D-Queens) to ban adding fluoride to the city\u2019s water. The city would then supply fluoride supplements to residents who ask. What do you think of that idea?\n\nA: It\u2019s been a longtime a debate around fluoride. I don\u2019t have enough medical understanding of the impact, if we do, we don\u2019t. I always felt fluoride was needed, and I would go with the medical experts over at the [NYC Health Department].\n\nQ: Would you say this mayor\u2019s race is the biggest fight of your political life?"

But White is the first credible opponent with a citywide political profile to challenge Norton since she was first elected in 1990.\n\nNorton\u2019s congressional office and campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhite has occupied the progressive lane in city politics, staking out political ground to the left of Mayor Muriel Bowser, whom he challenged in the 2022 Democratic primary. White, who serves in a citywide at-large seat, fell just over 10,000 votes short in a four-person field and had been widely seen as likely to launch another mayoral campaign in 2026.\n\nWhite sat in the back row of the Capitol Hill hearing room during the four-plus-hour House Oversight hearing with D.C.\u2019s top elected officials: Bowser \u2014 who called Norton as \u201cmighty warrior\u201d in her prepared testimony \u2014 as well as D.C. Council Chair Phil Mendelson and D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb.\n\nNorton, during her questioning time, defended the District\u2019s right to self-government and asked the three officials to weigh in on why the city deserved statehood.\n\nMost Republicans, however, pressed the city officials on their handling of crime in the District. GOP lawmakers have joined Trump in painting an image of the nation\u2019s capital as rife with crime to justify an August presidential order commandeering the city police and flooding federal agents and National Guard troops into the city.\n\nAs local officials came under siege from Republicans on the Oversight panel, Norton sat silent at her dais. She entered and left the hearing room several times flanked by an aide, sometimes appearing to lean on the person for support.\n\nSpeaking outside the hearing room, White said that he had informed Norton of his intention to run for her seat, although he declined to detail Norton\u2019s response in what he called a private conversation.\n\n\u201cWe in the District who love the congresswoman and respect the work that she\u2019s done \u2014 we know that she can\u2019t fight the fight that we need right now,\u201d White said, adding that he had met with 30 congressional offices since the presidential enforcement surge to discuss the need for a nationwide fight on behalf of the city.\n\nHe struck similar themes in a launch video he posted shortly after the hearing ended: \u201cWe need our best fighters right now,\u201d White said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to take this torch.\u201d\n\nThat message largely echoes what Norton\u2019s longtime adviser Donna Brazile wrote in a Washington Post op-ed this week urging her not to run. Norton, Brazile wrote, \u201cis no longer the dynamo she once was, at a time when D.C. needs the kind of energetic representation in Congress she provided for decades.\u201d\n\nAsked after the hearing if she supported another term for Norton, Bowser said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe she\u2019s filed for re-election.\u201d\n\nMendelson also sidestepped the question, telling reporters, \u201cEleanor Holmes Norton has done a lot for the District over the years, and I respect her, and I\u2019m going to leave it at that.\u201d"

He gave Trump 28 days to file an amended complaint.\n\nTrump signalled he would sue the New York Times earlier this week in a post on Truth Social, claiming the newspaper has been \"allowed to freely lie, smear and defame me for far too long\".\n\nA spokesperson for President Trump has said that he \"will continue to hold the Fake News accountable through this powerhouse lawsuit against the New York Times,\" the newspaper reported, and added that his legal team will file an amended version to meet the judge's directions.\n\nIn its own statement, the New York Times said it welcomes the judge's \"quick ruling, which recognised that the complaint was a political document rather than a serious legal filing\".\n\nThe paper had said earlier this week that the lawsuit has \"no merit.\"\n\n\"It lacks any legitimate legal claims and instead is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting,\" the newspaper said in a statement earlier this week.\n\nIn his order on Friday, Judge Merryday said the lawsuit filed by Trump is \"repetitive\" and \"superfluous\", and contains \"florid\" allegations.\n\nThe 85-page lawsuit was filed in federal court in Tampa earlier this week. It also names Penguin Random House LLC - the publisher of a book written by Times reporters last year - and accuses the newspaper of serving as a \"mouthpiece\" for Democrats.\n\nJudge Merryday wrote in his ruling that even if Trump's allegations were proven to be true, and even if the lawsuit were interpreted in a \"generous and lenient\" manner, the way it was written violates the rules of the court and is \"decidedly improper and impermissible.\"\n\nNeither President Trump nor his lawyers have yet responded to Judge Merryday's decision.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as the Trump administration has faced criticism for what opponents call a crackdown on media unfavourable to the president.\n\nOn Thursday, the US president suggested some TV networks should have their broadcast licenses \"taken away,\" after ABC suspended late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel only hours following threats from the Trump administration.\n\nKimmel's suspension came after he made comments about the Charlie Kirk murder suspect, saying Trump supporters had tried to \"characterise this kid (the suspect) as anything other than one of them.\"\n\nOther late-night TV hosts backed the comic, with Stephen Colbert calling the removal of Kimmel \"blatant censorship\"."

Meanwhile, in an early Saturday post on his Truth Social platform, Trump maintained that Siebert didn\u2019t quit \u2013 but rather: \u201cI fired him!\u201d\n\nHours earlier, Trump bluntly told reporters in the Oval Office: \u201cI want him out.\u201d The president claimed he soured on Siebert because Virginia\u2019s two Democratic senators had endorsed his nomination, but also claimed that James \u201cis very guilty of something\u201d. ABC News reported earlier on Friday that Trump decided to fire Siebert after he failed to obtain an indictment against James.\n\nIn 2024, James filed a civil lawsuit against Trump and his company that resulted in a significant financial penalty. That penalty was thrown out in August by an appeals court that upheld a judge\u2019s finding that Trump had engaged in fraud by exaggerating his wealth for decades.\n\nAfter a five-month investigation, officials did not find enough clear evidence to charge James with a crime, ABC News reported earlier this week. Trump nominated Siebert, who worked since 2010 as an assistant US attorney in that office, for the position in May.\n\nThe investigation centered on the allegation that James falsely said she was going to use a home she purchased in Virginia as her primary residence. While one document indicated James intended to use the home as her primary residence, others in the transaction show James clearly indicating she intended to use it as a second home.\n\nEd Martin, a former January 6 defendant lawyer who is leading the justice department effort to target Trump\u2019s political rivals, pressured prosecutors to seek an indictment, according to ABC News. Bill Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and a staunch Trump ally, who criminally referred James, had urged Trump to fire Siebert, according to ABC.\n\nPulte also referred California senator Adam Schiff, another political rival of Trump, and the Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook for mortgage fraud. The allegations in both of those cases appear similarly thin.\n\nThe justice department has long held a level of independence from the White House, an arms length seen as necessary to give Americans confidence its prosecutors and other attorneys are making enforcement decisions based on facts and not politics. Trump has upended that norm, firing career attorneys and FBI agents who worked on January 6 cases."

Their son Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was \"ecstatic and massively grateful\" to those who were involved in securing their release.\n\nThe Taliban, who detained the couple on 1 February, said the pair had broken Afghan laws and were released after judicial proceedings - but the Islamist group has never disclosed a reason for their detention.\n\nPeter and Barbie Reynolds married in Kabul in 1970 and spent the past 18 years running a charitable training programme that had been approved by local Taliban officials when the armed group reclaimed power in 2021.\n\nThere were emotional scenes on Friday as the couple's daughter, Sarah Entwistle, met her parents as they stepped off the plane in Doha.\n\n\"We are looking forward to returning to Afghanistan if we can. We are Afghan citizens,\" Barbie told Agence France-Presse at Kabul airport after Qatar-brokered negotiations for their release.\n\nTheir son Jonathan echoed those hopes, saying \"their desire would be to carry on living there and to do the work they were doing\".\n\n\"They have not just a heart for the people of Afghanistan, but they have strategy as well, and the work they've been doing has been very fruitful and has a massively positive impact,\" Jonathan told the BBC.\n\nHe said a few weeks ago he had managed to share the results of \"really encouraging\" reports about their programmes with his parents over the phone.\n\nHe said Barbie's initial reaction had been that they had \"more work to do\".\n\n\"But how do you do that in a country where you're not welcome,\" Jonathan added.\n\nSince 2009 the couple have been running training projects in Kabul and Bamiyan.\n\nOne of their education projects involved training women and children, and had apparently been approved by local authorities, despite a Taliban ban on women working and education for girls over 12-years-old.\n\nTheir affection for Afghanistan was demonstrated by their decision to remain in Bamiyan province after the authoritarian regime seized control in August 2021, while many other Westerners left - including most of their staff.\n\nThe couple's release follows months of public lobbying by their family, who have described the harrowing conditions of their detention.\n\nJonathan said in July that his father had been suffering serious convulsions and his mother was \"numb\" from anaemia and malnutrition.\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer praised the \"vital role\" played by Qatar in securing their release.\n\nA Qatari official told the BBC the couple were moved from Kabul's central prison to a larger facility with better conditions during the final stage of negotiations over their release.\n\nThe couple received medical checks in Doha before leaving for London.\n\nTaliban officials maintained they received adequate medical care during their detention and that their human rights were respected.\n\nThe UK does not recognise the Taliban government and closed its embassy in Kabul when the group returned to power.\n\nThe Foreign Office says support for British nationals in Afghanistan is therefore \"severely limited\" and advises against all travel to the country."

                "text": "Now Trump gets to nominate Dodaro\u2019s replacement, and key lawmakers are only just starting to take stock of a paradox: A president who continually tests the bounds of Congress\u2019 spending powers gets to pick the legislative branch\u2019s chief watchdog.\n\n\u201cIt sets up a very bad situation,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, the next Senate Democratic whip and a senior appropriator, said in an interview. \u201cAmong the things to be alarmed about, this is a new one.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are high: Whoever ends up running GAO once Dodaro\u2019s term ends will be able to bolster, or undermine, Congress\u2019 defenses against Trump in the separation-of-powers battle the president is stoking by terminating, freezing and reallocating hundreds of billions of dollars Congress previously approved.\n\n\u201cWhen one party controls the Senate, the House and the White House, there\u2019s a tendency to rally around the president and to do what the president wants,\u201d said David Walker, Dodaro\u2019s predecessor and the only living former GAO director. \u201cBut somebody\u2019s got to be able to be the independent referee, and to try to do what they think is in the interest of the institution, the Congress and the country. And that\u2019s what the comptroller general is.\u201d\n\nAll of this is taking place as Trump administration officials and some congressional Republicans have been trying to downsize and discredit the watchdog. That has included publicly questioning the GAO\u2019s authority and accusing the agency of siding with Democrats in its multiple determinations that the White House unlawfully flouted Congress\u2019 \u201cpower of the purse.\u201d\n\nWhite House budget director Russ Vought said this month that GAO is \u201ca quasi-legislative independent entity \u2026 something that shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nThere have been other slights, too. In the Senate, the GAO told Republicans they could not skirt the filibuster in voting to override California\u2019s pollution standards; Republicans did so anyway. In the House, GOP lawmakers endorsed cutting the agency\u2019s roughly $800 million budget in half for the upcoming fiscal year. And Elon Musk, prior to leaving the Trump administration, attempted to send in a Department of Government Efficiency team to assess the GAO for mass staff reductions.\n\nMeanwhile, the legislative branch writ large has become more broadly vulnerable to the White House\u2019s whims, seen most starkly in Trump\u2019s abrupt firing of the librarian of Congress and the registrar of copyrights.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear what the Dodaro succession plan will look like; a White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA 10-member panel of lawmakers is supposed to recommend at least three replacement candidates for Trump to consider. By law, that group is composed of the top leaders in each chamber, the chairs and ranking members of the key House and Senate oversight committees and the Senate president pro tempore.\n\nHowever, most congressional leaders have yet to start hunting for qualified contenders, and furthermore seem largely unaware they have any role to play in filling the slot.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know the process,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in a brief interview. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while. This hasn\u2019t happened on my watch.\u201d\n\nTwo of the would-be commission members had kind words for Dodaro, including Sen. Rand Paul, chair of the Senate Homeland and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always appreciated him, and I think he\u2019s a straight shooter,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said in an interview.\n\nSen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), the panel\u2019s ranking member, said he \u201cwould want somebody like Gene, who has been a really solid member.\u201d\n\nOn the House side, Oversight Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) said in an interview he\u2019s looking for the next GAO director to be \u201can aggressive person that looks for waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d\n\nComer added, \u201cWe want someone that communicates regularly with Congress, so we can kind of have an idea of what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nBut Trump could instead ask Republican senators to confirm a new watchdog of his own choosing \u2014 or forgo making a nomination altogether.\n\nIt would leave a leadership vacuum at the top of the agency that not only monitors whether Congress\u2019 spending directives are followed but is also empowered to examine the effectiveness of federal agencies on behalf of lawmakers.\n\nFurther raising the stakes in confirming a new director, lawsuits are pending around the country challenging Trump\u2019s withholding of congressionally approved funding, and a federal appeals court ruled this summer that only the GAO director can sue the administration for violating the decades-old impoundment law \u2014 not the groups that were set to receive the funding.\n\nDodaro has so far chosen not to sue the Trump administration for withholding funding. But when he steps down, he\u2019ll be able to pick an acting GAO director who also would have the power to file a lawsuit if they so choose.\n\nStill, said Molly Reynolds, head of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, \u201cif you get a comptroller general in place who is Trump-friendly, that is going to foreclose that option\u201d of GAO suing the administration.\n\nAn acting director also wouldn\u2019t be \u201cin a position to make major transformational changes,\u201d warned Walker, the former GAO director.\n\nWhen Walker resigned in 2008, he appointed Dodaro acting director, a title that stuck for more than two years because Congress and the president weren\u2019t quick to work through the nomination process. Before that, it also took two years to formally install Walker in the post in 1998.\n\nWalker is now urging congressional leaders to recommend candidates who are willing to challenge executive branch officials regardless of who is president, as he did during his own tenure. A political independent who \u201cleans Republican\u201d and was confirmed by a GOP-led Senate, Walker sued the Republican vice president, Dick Cheney, for failure to provide GAO access to records.\n\nHe is also agitating for lawmakers to quickly start the search for potential replacements: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason that they shouldn\u2019t be planning now so that they can end up trying to make a timely decision.\u201d"

A proposed U.S. peace plan faltered following deadly attacks in Jerusalem and Israel's controversial targeting of Hamas leaders in Qatar, leading to a full-scale invasion of Gaza. The situation remains dire for civilians caught in the conflict, with local journalists documenting the extensive human suffering, while hopes for a resolution seem increasingly distant.",

                "text": "I\u2019ve been reporting from the Mideast for some 25 years now. And that hackneyed cliche still works \u2026 \"The more things change \u2026 The more they stay the same\".\n\nWhich is not to say the three weeks we\u2019ve stayed here this time have been dull. There have been more ups and downs than a run-down roller coaster at an old Luna Park.\n\nOur first field shoot was appropriately enough to visit released hostages and families of captives of Hamas. Because, for the majority of Israelis, this is one of the most important topics. 48 people held by terrorists, 20 still alive. Their time of imprisonment, the nearly 2 years of this Gaza war.\n\nSPAIN'S PRIME MINISTER SPARKS OUTRAGE OVER ALLEGED NUCLEAR THREAT AGAINST ISRAEL\n\nWe met the families on Day 700 of the hostages\u2019 captivity. Lishay Lava-Mira begged for her husband Omri to come home. Liron Berman was sure his twin brothers would make it (\"They\u2019re strong\"). And Keith Siegel, a hostage, himself, for close to 500 days, articulate and healthy, looked beyond the Israeli government for help. \"I call upon Trump to continue his efforts.\"\n\nEarly in our stay there was hope a new peace plan from the U.S. might gain traction. All 48 hostages would be released in exchange for 3,000 Palestinian prisoners, and a cease-fire to assess the next steps.\n\nThat seemingly reasonable plan took hits left, right and center.\n\nCRUZ SLAMS UN'S ISRAEL \u2018GENOCIDE\u2019 CHARGE, PUSHES FOR CONSEQUENCES\n\nFirst a horror we learned about as we\u2019d finished a quick breakfast at our hotel. Two gunmen shooting up a busy commuter bus and bus stop in Jerusalem, leaving six dead and many more injured. The scenes were horrific and the actions to eliminate the terrorists brave.\n\nThen the next morning, as cameraman Ben and I were doing a routine round-up of the news on the hotel balcony we call home, I noticed in the corner of my eye longtime and dedicated producer Yael inside our studio room jumping up and down.\n\nIsrael had done the unthinkable, targeting Hamas leadership in what should have been the neutral zone of Doha, Qatar. The militants claimed they were discussing the peace plan at the time. That U.S. proposal became as dead as any victims the Israelis managed to hit (apparently no leadership).\n\nAnd then to put the final \"paid\" to peace talks. The much-touted full-scale ground invasion of Gaza City by Israel was launched. To finish off some 3,000 remaining Hamas fighters and their infrastructure. As Netanyahu put it \"What starts in Gaza (the ugly Hamas massacre and hostage-taking of Oct. 7.) ends in Gaza.\"\n\nAnd this is when the frustration sets in for grizzled combat reporters like me, and our top-notch war team of camera Ben, Producer Yael, and Security Rob. As they have throughout the war, Israel limiting access to the Gaza action.\n\nSo we depend on local journalists to show us the horror. The destroyed urban scene. And most importantly, the vast and ugly images of human suffering. Hundreds of thousands of civilians, many not Hamas supporters, having to deal with the living hell that the terrorists and the fighting have imposed on them.\n\nRemember that line, \"I wouldn\u2019t wish this on my worst enemy\"? Well, maybe I\u2019d go with it regarding Hamas, but not these poor Palestinian children who know nothing of the geopolitics of the situation.\n\nTo their credit, IDF officials tell us they are moving slowly through the lunar landscape that is now Gaza. Careful not to endanger civilians and /or hostages. Somehow, with Hamas-backed local health officials indicating 65,000 have already been killed after 2 years of war, it seems somewhat after the fact.\n\nBut that means, again, according to the officials we\u2019ve spoken to, this whole Gaza City process could take as long as four months to complete. Too long for the morale-sapped reservists fighting the war. Too long for the inhabitants enduring it all. Too long for the desperate hostages.\n\nUnless there\u2019s a breakthrough.\n\nNo wonder the locals here look to President Donald Trump and/or a range of countries, bodies, figures (yes, Pope Leo) to try to intercede beyond the local leaders, Israel\u2019s past duels with foes like Hezbollah and Iran seemed like well-tuned 21st century war-making. The fighting in Gaza is more like early 20th century ugly World War I trench warfare.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn between our live shots and reporting in Tel Aviv, we occasionally nip out to a few of the bars and restaurants that dot this seaside metropolis\u2014despite all, running full tilt. And wonder what this country would be like, as well, of course, what it would be like for the diverse Palestinian population without the yoke of war around their shoulders.\n\nNo answers this trip."

                "text": "A global agreement designed to protect the world's oceans and reverse damage to marine life is set to become international law.\n\nThe High Seas Treaty received its 60th ratification by Morocco on Friday, meaning that it will now take effect from January.\n\nThe deal, which has been two decades in the making, will pave the way for international waters to be placed into marine protected areas.\n\nEnvironmentalists heralded the milestone as a \"monumental achievement\" and evidence that countries can work together for environmental protection.\n\n\"Covering more than two-thirds of the ocean, the agreement sets binding rules to conserve and sustainably use marine biodiversity,\" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.\n\nDecades of overfishing, pollution from shipping and warming oceans from climate change have damaged life below the surface.\n\nIn the latest assessment of marine species, nearly 10% were found to be at risk of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\nThree years ago, countries agreed that 30% of the world's national and international waters - the high seas - must be protected by 2030 to help depleted marine life recover.\n\nBut protecting the high seas is challenging. No one country controls these waters and all nations have a right to ship and fish there.\n\nCurrently just 1% of the high seas are protected, leaving marine life at risk of overexploitation.\n\nSo, in 2023, countries signed the High Seas Treaty, pledging to put 30% of these waters into Marine Protected Areas.\n\nBut it was only able to enter force if more than 60 nations ratified it - meaning they agreed to be legally bound by it.\n\nWith many nations requiring parliamentary approval, ratification can often take longer than five years, Elizabeth Wilson, senior director for environmental policy at The Pews Charitable Trust, told the BBC at the UN Oceans Conference earlier this year. She said this was \"record time\".\n\nThe UK introduced its bill for ratification to Parliament earlier this month.\n\nKirsten Schuijt, director-general of the World Wide Fund for Nature, hailed \"a monumental achievement for ocean conservation\" after the treaty threshold was reached.\n\nShe added: \"The High Seas Treaty will be a positive catalyst for collaboration across international waters and agreements and is a turning point for two-thirds of the world's ocean that lie beyond national jurisdiction.\"\n\nMads Christensen, executive director of Greenpeace International, called it \"a landmark moment\" and \"proof that countries can come together to protect our blue planet\".\n\n\"The era of exploitation and destruction must end. Our oceans can't wait and neither can we,\" he added.\n\nOnce the treaty comes into force, countries will propose areas to be protected, and these will then be voted on by the countries that sign up to the treaty.\n\nCritics point out that countries will conduct their own environmental impact assessments and make the final decision - although other countries can register concerns with monitoring bodies.\n\nThe ocean is crucial for the survival of all organisms on the planet. It is the largest ecosystem, is estimated to contribute $2.5tn (\u00a31.9tn) to world economies, and provides up to 80% of the oxygen we breathe."

Instead, it largely relies on individual countries to regulate their own ships and companies. If a ship flying a German flag violates the rules, for example, it\u2019s Germany\u2019s responsibility to act, said Torsten Thiele, founder of the Global Ocean Trust and an adviser on ocean governance and blue finance. That makes universal ratification essential, he said.\n\n\u201cIf somebody hasn\u2019t signed up, they\u2019ll argue they\u2019re not bound,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat are the High Seas?\n\nThe treaty covers international waters that fall outside any single country\u2019s exclusive economic zone and account for nearly two-thirds of the ocean and nearly half of Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nIt also covers what is known as \u201cthe Area\u201d, shorthand for seabed and subsoil beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. That comprises just more than half of the planet\u2019s seabed.\n\nNow that the treaty is law, a decision-making body, a Conference of the Parties (COP), will have to work with regional and global organisations that already oversee different aspects of the oceans, such as the International Seabed Authority.\n\nDeep-Sea mining risks\n\nOne aspect of the Marine Biodiversity Treaty is to ensure that countries can work towards more fair and equitable sharing of benefits from activities related to marine biodiversity beyond the borders of any one nation, as a handful of governments and companies push to rapidly expand deep-sea mining.\n\nEnvironmentalists say the potential consequences of dredging the ocean floor used to extract deep-sea minerals are difficult to calculate and range from endangering ancient lifeforms like dumbo octopuses and twilight zone corals to causing further distress to whales by distorting their sonar communication.\n\nAt least 38 countries are calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until more is known about its potential harm to marine ecosystems, including those which have yet to be explored.\n\nThey include island states like the Marshall Islands and Vanuatu, as well as bigger countries like Brazil and the United Kingdom, while other countries, including the US under Trump, and the small Pacific island nation of Nauru, want to press ahead.\n\nInternational efforts continue\n\nThe Marine Biodiversity Treaty is the latest example of continued efforts to combat environmental threats at the global level, despite pushback from some governments.\n\nEarlier this year, countries at the UN shipping agency struck a deal on a global fuel emissions standard for the maritime sector, which will impose an emissions fee on dirty fuels and reward vessels that reduce their emissions.\n\nThe deal was reached after the US pulled out of the climate talks at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London and threatened to impose \u201creciprocal measures\u201d against any fees charged to US ships.\n\nIn August, global talks to develop a landmark treaty to tackle plastic pollution failed to reach an agreement, amid deadlock at the sixth round of talks in under three years.\n\nBut in July, the UN\u2019s highest court found that countries must meet their climate obligations, and that failing to do so could violate international law, potentially opening the door for affected nations to seek reparations in future legal cases.\n\nVanuatu\u2019s minister for climate change, Ralph Regenvanu, who led the case at the International Court of Justice, reacted to the Marine Biodiversity Treaty entering into force, saying: \u201cEverything that affects the ocean affects us.\u201d"

The Chinese embassy emphasized that any agreement should not be exclusive or undermine Papua New Guinea's sovereignty, while local politicians and former military leaders expressed concerns that the proposed defense deal with Australia could compromise the country's independence and constitutional authority. They called for safeguards to ensure Papua New Guinea's ability to engage with multiple countries without restrictions.",

                "text": "China has urged Papua New Guinea not to sign a treaty that could restrict or prevent it from cooperating with another country, days after Australia failed to secure a defence pact with the Pacific nation.\n\nIn a statement on Facebook late on Thursday, the Chinese embassy in Papua New Guinea said it respected the country\u2019s \u201cright to conclude a bilateral treaty with other countries on a voluntary basis\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, such a treaty should not be exclusive in nature, nor should it restrict or prevents a sovereign country from cooperating with a third party for any reason. It should also refrain from targeting any third party or undermining its legitimate rights and interests.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the PNG side will continue to uphold independence and self-reliance, properly handle issues bearing on its sovereignty and long-term interests,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement comes after Australia and its former colony were expected this week to ratify the Pukpuk mutual defence treaty. But Australia\u2019s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, left Port Moresby on Wednesday without signing the deal with his counterpart, James Marape. Instead, Albanese sealed a communique that laid out the wording of the pact after Papua New Guniea\u2019s cabinet failed to agree to the deal.\n\nAlbanese said the text of the defence agreement had been confirmed but both governments had more work to do. If signed, the treaty is expected to lock the two countries into joint defence arrangements in the event of a military attack, and to allow citizens of both countries to serve in the defence forces of the other.\n\n\u201cWe will go through our respective cabinet processes and expect to finalise the signing of the treaty, the words of which have been agreed, in coming weeks,\u201d Albanese told a press conference in Port Moresby on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, politicians and several prominent ex-military figures in Papua New Guinea have expressed reservations about the defence deal, arguing that it could impinge on the country\u2019s independence.\n\nThe leader of the opposition, Douglas Tomuriesa, said Papua New Guinea \u201cneeds strong partnerships but not at the cost of our constitutional authority, legal protections for our citizens or independent decision-making\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, Tomuriesa said he welcomed cooperation to strengthen the defence force but any arrangement must contain safeguards and \u201creview mechanisms to keep sovereignty intact\u201d.\n\nRetired major general Jerry Singirok, commander of the Papua New Guinea defence force during the 1990s, described the treaty as a \u201cviolation\u201d of the constitution. He noted that Papua New Guinea had an \u201cimportant principle \u2026 of not being aligned to any countries in the face of threat\u201d.\n\n\u201cBecause our foreign policy says that we are friends to all and enemies to none,\u201d he said. \u201cChina is not a threat or enemy to Papua New Guinea. It\u2019s [as] simple as that. This is the superpower rivalry in the region against smaller Pacific states.\u201d\n\nFormer Papua New Guinea defence force (PNGDF) commander Maj Gen Gilbert Toropo agreed there were \u201ccompeting interests in the region\u201d. He said Papua New Guinea \u201cstands in the crossroads of the region \u2026 where Papua New Guinea is going to be the playground for our big players\u201d.\n\nToropo said Australia and Papua New Guinea should forge stronger ties, but not at the expense of his country\u2019s \u201cfreedom to engage with other countries\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs a sovereign nation, we should have the flexibility to reach out to the rest of the world for our prosperity,\u201d he said, adding that every Papua New Guinean should be consulted and made aware of the treaty\u2019s contents.\n\nPeter Ilau, PNGDF commander between 2001 and 2010, emphasised that Papua New Guinea could not compromise its sovereignty because of a \u201cnice looking decree\u201d that appeared to cover \u201call aspects of friendship, partnership, traditional friends\u201d.\n\nAnalysts have also joined the call for the deal not to be rushed through, as former commander Singirok urged Papua New Guinea to consider alternative ways to strengthen the alliance.\n\n\u201cWe have a very good close relationship with Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure there are other ways to develop our capabilities without absorbing our military into the Australian army.\u201d"

                "source": "BBC",
                "text": "Russia's answer to Eurovision is less kitsch, more Kremlin\n\n17 hours ago\n\nSteve RosenbergRussia editor in Moscow\n\nAt a Moscow concert hall, Shohruhmirzo Ganiev is crooning about love and his motherland, Uzbekistan.\n\n\"Put your legs together like a man,\" suggests his voice coach and choreographer. \"And spread your arms wider!\"\n\nIt's just a rehearsal, but Shohruhmirzo is singing his heart out. He's performing traditional Uzbek melodies to a modern beat and playing a doira, the ancient drum of Central Asia.\n\nUzbekistan is among 23 countries competing at the Intervision Song Contest.\n\nIt's Russia's answer to Eurovision. With less kitsch \u2013 and more Kremlin.\n\nIntervision 2025 is Vladimir Putin's brainchild. He signed a decree reviving the Soviet-era songfest with the aim of \"developing international cultural and humanitarian co-operation\".\n\nThe more obvious objective is creating an international song contest in which Moscow can actually take part. In 2022 Russia was banned from competing in Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA pattern's emerging.\n\nWhen Team Russia was banned from the Olympic Games, Moscow tried to create alternatives, like the Games of the Future and the World Friendship Games.\n\nNow the Kremlin's come up with its own version of Eurovision.\n\nBut what does it look like and who is taking part?\n\nFor Intervision, the Russians have cast their musical net far and wide, inviting allies from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. The starting line-up reflects the political and economic alliances of which Russia is part, like the Brics group of nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Commonwealth of Independent States.\n\nThe list of participating countries includes China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Vietnam, Venezuela, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Madagascar: a very different musical map from Eurovision, and an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that, despite its invasion of Ukraine, Russia still has friends.\n\nThe United States, too, is taking part: a sign of the thaw in US-Russian relations since Donald Trump's return to the White House.\n\nThaw doesn't mean problem-free. America's original Intervision entrant Brandon Howard pulled out on the eve of the contest.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I had some... family issues that happened here domestically, that I wasn't [going] to be able to go abroad and do that,\" the singer, who performs as B.Howard, tells me on a call from the US.\n\n\"However, I really believe that it's such a wonderful event.\"\n\n\"Were there some people who said to you 'Brandon, you shouldn't go, because of the war?'\" I asked.\n\n\"Some fans would mention some things like that and expressed slight concern. However, for the most part, everyone was very supportive of me going there, being sent to be a beacon of light.\"\n\nB.Howard has been replaced by Australian-Greek singer Vassy who lives in Los Angeles.\n\n\"4.3 billion people live in the 23 participating countries,\" boasted senior Kremlin official Sergei Kiriyenko. \"That's more than half the world's population.\"\n\nMr Kiriyenko, President Putin's deputy chief of staff, chairs the song contest's supervisory board. He made a brief appearance this week at an Intervision press conference alongside Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko.\n\n\"I know some people think there's an element of politics in Eurovision,\" I tell Mr Lavrov. \"But look who's represented here: the Kremlin, the foreign ministry and the Russian government. Isn't that proof that Intervision is a purely political or geopolitical project?\"\n\n\"If the governments of some countries make no effort to create mechanisms for supporting culture, that's their choice,\" Mr Lavrov replies. \"In our country the state is engaged in the promotion of the arts. Your question is rooted in the fear of competition.\"\n\nIn Ukraine they fear something quite different: that Moscow is using Intervision to divert global attention from the war.\n\n\"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine considers that the Intervision 2025 song contest organised by Russia is an instrument of hostile propaganda and a means of whitewashing the aggressive policy of the Russian Federation,\" the ministry stated back in May.\n\nThe war is on some people's minds at Intervision.\n\n\"The scary thing is with the war, with whatever's happening. These are the things we were thinking about,\" says Renee Kruger from South African group Mzansi Jikelele.\n\n\"But we were assured: 'Just come, guys, nothing's wrong'. Obviously, we are [nervous], but we're here and we've been treated very well.\"\n\nRepresenting Russia at Intervision 2025 is Yaroslav Dronov, better known by his stage name Shaman. Last year the European Union sanctioned him for \"supporting actions and policies that undermine the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.\"\n\nHis previous hits include I'm Russian, a patriotic pop song that declares:\n\n\"I'm Russian, I go to the end\u2026 I'm Russian, to spite the whole world.\"\n\nNot exactly Love Shine A Light or Save Your Kisses for Me.\n\nBut Russia is using Intervision to project a softer image than the one forged by three-and-a-half years of its war in Ukraine.\n\nAt the official song contest draw to decide the running order, international delegations are being treated to a Russian feast, including cottage cheese pancakes and gingerbread sporting the Intervision logo. As folk dancers put on a spectacular show, volunteers hand out giant necklaces of bread rings, a symbol of Russian hospitality.\n\nOne by one the participants approach a gigantic samovar, select a tea cup and fill it with hot water. The magic mugs reveal the performance slot number for each country.\n\nFrom the folk costumes to the blinis, the emphasis here is on tradition.\n\nIt's the same with the songs. The official goal of the contest is to \"get to know the unique cultural traditions and achievements of participating countries [and] promote universal, spiritual, family, cultural, ethical and religious traditions of different nations.\"\n\nThe international performers have read the rulebook.\n\n\"My song tells about culture from Vietnam,\" Vietnamese entrant Duc Phuc informs me. \"I need to share the culture of Vietnam with everyone.\"\n\n\"How were you chosen to represent your country?\" I ask.\n\n\"The Ministry of Culture chose me.\"\n\n\"Our song is about a woman called Maria,\" says Brazilian entrant Tais Nader. \"Maria is like any Brazilian woman. She works hard to live. But she's always smiling and her eyes are shining.\"\n\n\"Have you heard of Eurovision?\" I ask.\n\n\"Actually, we searched online about Intervision and discovered Eurovision! Before, we didn't know about Intervision or Eurovision. It's new for us.\"\n\nFor many Russians, too, Intervision is something new. In fact it is a ghost from communist times summoned from the grave of song contests past.\n\nThe original Intervision Song Contest was born behind the Iron Curtain at a time when East and West competed in everything. In the Cold War there was a space race, an arms race and culture wars, too.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s Eurovision quickly established itself as a big deal in Western Europe, while in the Eastern bloc song festivals in Czechoslovakia and Poland acquired the occasional tag of 'Intervision'.\n\nThere was, though, some crossover. Finland took part in both Eurovision and Intervision, and big names from the West made guest appearances in the East. Gloria Gaynor, Petula Clarke and Boney-M all performed at Intervision.\n\nAfter the fall of communism Russia and Eastern Europe embraced the political changes sweeping the continent and were eager to compete in Eurovision. I saw that first hand in 1996 when, by a quirk of fate, I co-presented Russian TV's Song for Europe competition to select a Eurovision entry.\n\nDuring a guided tour of Russian TV, I'd got chatting to the show's director. When I told him I was a huge Eurovision fan he'd asked me to come back that evening to help anchor the programme. I'll never forget how excited everyone in the studio was that night: not only about Eurovision, but about Russia being part of the European family.\n\nBut will people watch it? Will the Intervision singers and songs capture the public's imagination across so many continents? The considerable time differences between the participating countries will likely preclude the kind of shared viewing experience you get with Eurovision.\n\nAnd there'll be no public vote. Just a jury: one member per country. But how will the voting take place?\n\n\"The voting system is specially invented by a very famous scientist and mathematician,\" Russian TV's Intervision commentator Yana Churikova tells me. \"Specially for Intervision.\"\n\nBack in the rehearsal room, Uzbekistan's entrant Shohruhmirzo Ganiev admits he doesn't know the intricacies of the voting system. He's just excited to be here. So is his mother. She's looking on proudly as her son rehearses.\n\nEven though his country isn't in Eurovision, Shohruhmirzo tells me that contest is famous in Uzbekistan. Right now, though, he's focused on his performance here.\n\n\"I'm very happy to come to Intervision,\" he tells me. \"I'm leaving Eurovision in the past.\""

                "text": "How a man's affair with his mother-in-law became a viral film in Indonesia\n\n17 hours ago\n\nKoh EweSingapore and\n\nRiana IbrahimBBC Indonesian, Jakarta\n\nFor months, Indonesian movie audiences have been talking about one film: Norma, the story of a seemingly blissful marriage shattered by the husband's clandestine affair with his mother-in-law.\n\nIt's the kind of plot that was always going to attract melodrama fans. But what has made Norma a nationwide obsession is the fact that it's based on a viral true story.\n\nIn 2022, Norma Risma, a woman in Serang City on Indonesia's Java island, exposed her husband and mother's affair in a TikTok video.\n\nHer story quickly racked up millions of views, made headlines and ultimately brought her a movie deal that has taken South East Asia by storm.\n\nNorma, which hit Indonesian theatres in March and Netflix in August, soon became one of the most watched movies, not just in Indonesia but also Malaysia and Singapore, where there are large Malay-Muslim populations.\n\nIt also follows a winning formula that Indonesian filmmakers have discovered: adapting viral social media scandals.\n\nUntil this June, Indonesia's highest-grossing film of all time was KKN di Desa Penari, a 2022 horror story about the haunting of six university students, which came from a popular thread on X. In 2023 came Sewu Dino, another horror flick adapted from a story shared by the same X account.\n\nEqually popular are tales of a more salacious persuasion: Ipar Adalah Maut, a 2024 Indonesian movie about an affair between a man and his sister-in-law, was marketed as a true story adapted from a TikTok video. The 2022 drama series Layangan Putus, about a family torn apart by a cheating husband, also got its inspiration from TikTok.\n\nSuch themes are highly taboo in Indonesia, where adultery is punishable with jail time. The country's new criminal code, set to take effect nationwide next year, outlaws sex outside marriage - and in its most conservative province, couples are already publicly flogged for premarital sex.\n\nBut in this culture of religious conservatism, experts say, a voyeuristic interest in household scandals thrives.\n\nWith the help of social media, stories that had mostly been limited to neighbourhood gossip now make for viral \"pelakor\" content, a slang term for homewrecker and an oft-used keyword in videos of wives confronting their husbands' mistresses.\n\n\"With films about these scandals, people are given a space to peek into someone else's household problems,\" SM Gietty Tambunan, a member of the Jakarta Arts Council Film Committee, tells BBC Indonesian.\n\n\"Especially because of that conservative culture, people are becoming even more curious.\"\n\nA taste for scandal\n\nVero, a 42-year-old housewife in Jakarta, has been following Norma's story since it went viral on TikTok. It made her \"furious with the husband and mother\", she tells BBC Indonesian.\n\n\"When I knew this story was being made into a movie, I wanted to see how cruel these two people were to Norma,\" she says.\n\nIn the cinema she cried at the movie's climax, when Norma weaved through a crowd outside her house to find her half-dressed husband and mother in the room.\n\nThe tender scenes of Norma's husband and mother resisting and then realising their romance has both scandalised and captured viewers.\n\n\"Surely after filming this they will feel sick,\" a TikTok user commented on a scene where the pair kissed. In the film, a friend who discovers the pair's illicit relationship vomits when she catches them in the act.\n\nMs Gietty warns that these narratives have a dangerous tendency to put the blame mostly on women rather than the cheating men. In these feuds between the legitimate spouse and the illicit lover, \"the man tends not to receive any punishment,\" she says.\n\nBut what sets the film Norma apart is the involvement of the protagonist herself in the creative process, the film's screenwriter Oka Aurora tells BBC Indonesian. She is also behind the script for Ipar Adalah Maut and Layangan Putus, the two other TikTok-inspired productions.\n\nAfter intense discussions with Norma about her feelings and her mother's backstory, the film's \"core story remains broadly consistent\", says Oka, though she added that there were \"definitely certain parts that were dramatised to play with the audience's emotions\".\n\n\"This film is also a way for people to release emotions and have fun. So when they leave the cinema, there are things they feel and talk about.\"\n\nLife for Norma\n\nToday, the real Norma works as an outsourced worker in Serang, her hometown.\n\nHer mother, Rihanah, has returned home to live with the family after an eight-month prison stint for adultery. Rozy, Norma's ex-husband, was sentenced to nine months in jail.\n\nDuring a press appearance for the film in February, Norma said she was encouraged by the messages she had received from other victims of cheating spouses.\n\n\"When I experienced [the affair], I thought, 'Why am I being cheated on by the person closest to me? Am I the only one experiencing this?' It turns out that when I spoke up, many people had experienced the same thing,\" said Norma."

While the Norwegian Film Institute continues to support this growth, challenges in financing and the influence of streaming services pose potential hurdles for future projects.",

                "text": "When it comes to film-making, Norway has long been left watching on while its Nordic neighbours Sweden and Denmark put out hit after hit by luminaries such as Lars von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg and Ruben \u00d6stlund.\n\nBut after years in the shadows, the country has finally found its place in the international spotlight with a number of distinctive, relationship-centred and critically acclaimed films and television shows in what many are describing as a Norwegian \u201cgolden age\u201d.\n\nThe last few months alone have seen the release of Dreams, the third of Dag Johan Haugerud\u2019s Oslo Stories Trilogy, which won the biggest prize at this year\u2019s Berlin film festival; Joachim Trier\u2019s Sentimental Value, which was awarded the Grand Prix at Cannes and comes off the back of his Oscar-nominated The Worst Person in the World; Lilja Ingolfsdottir\u2019s Loveable; and Armand, the directorial debut feature from Halfdan Ullmann T\u00f8ndel.\n\nMeanwhile, Pernille (known as P\u00f8rni in Norway) has found dedicated audiences around the world since the Viaplay comedy drama series about the life of a single-parent family was recommissioned by Netflix.\n\n\u201cWe are in a golden age of Norwegian cinema,\u201d Ullmann T\u00f8ndel, who is working on the script for his next film, told the Guardian. \u201cEspecially in terms of recognition from the biggest festivals and how Norwegian cinema films are being perceived outside of Norway.\u201d\n\nAlthough there has been no shortage of talented Norwegian film-makers \u2013 including Trier and Haugerud \u2013 on the whole, Ullmann T\u00f8ndel said, films coming out of Norway had generally been \u201cquite safe\u201d. This was not the case, he said, among the younger generation, many of whom have formed a collective to encourage and inspire one another to take risks and have fun. Others to break through recently with their directorial debuts include Emilie Blichfeldt, with The Ugly Stepsister, and Thea Hvistendal, with Handling the Undead.\n\n\u201cWhat is so great is that all of us have a very different visuality. That\u2019s a really important thing in Norwegian cinema,\u201d said Ullmann T\u00f8ndel. \u201cBecause in Sweden for example, everybody tried to make Ruben \u00d6stlund films for a while and in Denmark everyone tried to make Lars von Trier films for a while. So we really try to nurture our own singularity.\u201d\n\nIf there is a face of this new wave, then it is almost certainly the unvarnished expressions of Renate Reinsve, who can be found collapsing into seven minutes of laughter in Armand and finding her way through the micro-details of romantic relationships in all their joy, pain, awkwardness and humour as she did in the 2021 hit The Worst Person in the World.\n\n\u201cShe is so intuitive and smart, and goes very deep into her roles, but she does it with a lightness,\u201d said Ullmann T\u00f8ndel, adding that she is also very funny. \u201cShe has a remarkable understanding, it seems, of what makes us human.\u201d\n\nNorway\u2019s newfound international stature in the film world has not gone unnoticed by its neighbours.\n\n\u201cIt hurts to admit it because of our countries\u2019 eternal rivalry, but Norway is light years ahead of Sweden in terms of cultivating original cinematic voices,\u201d said Kristoffer Viita, an author and film critic for the Swedish broadcaster SVT.\n\nWhile Viita takes some consolation from the fact that Ullman T\u00f8ndel\u2019s grandfather \u2013 the legendary director Ingmar Bergman \u2013 was Swedish, he is not sure that the young Norwegian director would have been able to follow his same path in Sweden, where the film industry is focused mainly on Swedish audiences.\n\nHenriette Steenstrup, who wrote and starred in Pernille, said that as a Norwegian she had not expected her series to be an international success \u2013 because of the specifically Norwegian society it showed. Unlike Nordic noir\u2019s focus on crime and detectives, her series focused on everyday subjects such as family and loss. \u201cThere is a lot of drama in everyday life,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile it is easier to make films in Norway than in many other countries, with consistent state funding and a steady flow of talent emerging from free-of-charge film schools, film-makers are coming up against growing difficulties in getting their projects financed.\n\n\u201cNorway is a big hub of talent,\u201d said Hege Hauff Hvattum, one of the producers of the Oslo Stories Trilogy. \u201cThe money from the Norwegian Film Institute (NFI) has been good in the sense that many projects have been realised with a mix of Nordic funding alone, but it\u2019s not been increased at the same speed as the costs, so we\u2019re starting to wonder how it will be in the future. Especially since the streamers are not doing as much drama and films and TV series as they did, that\u2019s an issue.\u201d\n\nThere was also the problem of streamers seeking to make films more appealing to wider audiences, which Hauff Hvattum said could result in making them generic. \u201cIf you want to tell a story that is honest and precise, I believe that is easier if you write out of a local perspective to capture the nuances \u2013 it\u2019s more interesting,\u201d she said.\n\nKjersti Mo, the CEO of the NFI, said Norway\u2019s success was the product of long-term state investment in film-making \u2013 about 670m NOK (\u00a350m) this year \u2013 and the professionalisation of its film industry in terms of working with international partners.\n\nThe NFI tries to help independent film-makers in the way it structures their financing, by making it dependent on theatrical release and owning their own rights. \u201cWe have to empower our creatives and producers so that they still have a choice,\u201d said Mo. \u201cIn the ecosystem the money from the streamers still matters but we will not let them design everything.\u201d The NFI\u2019s job, she said, was to \u201cempower the art side\u201d of film-making.\n\nContrary to an overall move towards dumbing down, Mo said that increasingly, films selected by the institute for their artistic merits were also the ones that were popular among audiences. \u201cThat makes me really happy. We are building awareness in the Norwegian population so they are proud of the films and proud of the film-makers.\u201d\n\nNorway, she said, had always been \u201cthe little brother or sister\u201d to Denmark and Sweden when it came to film. \u201cThey are mostly happy for us,\u201d Mo said. \u201cI think it is also an inspiration.\u201d\n\nBut Sarah Iben Almbjerg, the film editor at the Danish newspaper Berlingske, said it would not be long before Danish film was \u201cback in the international limelight\u201d. She added: \u201cUntil then, the Norwegians can enjoy their place in the sun.\u201d"

The brigade's flag is pinned up behind him.\n\nThe aspiring long-distance runner says he was tricked into joining the Russian army and is desperate to go home to see his 16-year-old daughter.\n\nIn a Facebook post accompanying the video, the 57th Separate Motorised Infantry Brigade said it was an example of how Russia treats foreign recruits but added that he had \"fought on the side of the enemy, so whether to believe the words and tears is up to your discretion\".\n\nThe brigade said the interview was filmed with Kibet's consent, but the BBC has not verified this. Though recruits from abroad in the Russian army are not unheard of, this is a rare case of a captive foreigner speaking on video.\n\nCitizens of Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba and Sri Lanka , among others, are currently held in Ukrainian prisoner-of-war camps, Petro Yatsenko, Ukraine's spokesperson on the treatment of prisoners of war, told the BBC.\n\n\"Most of these individuals come from poorer countries and end up on the Russian side in different ways. Some are deceived \u2013 promised jobs at factories \u2013 while others join the war voluntarily. It is important to understand that very few are captured alive; most are either killed or seriously injured,\" he added.\n\nBack in Kenya, Kibet's family and friends are in shock over what they have seen.\n\nAfter a heavy sigh and a long pause, his cousin Edith Chesoi told the BBC that she had been replaying the video over and over in her head.\n\n\"I am so traumatised. I didn't sleep at night. I don't even know what to say.\"\n\nKibet's younger brother, Isaac Kipyego, described him as \"humble guy and a man with a few words\" as well as a pillar and advisor to the rest of the family.\n\nThey know him as someone dedicated to his sport.\n\n\"I love running, I love running,\" Kibet says on the Ukrainian video. And it was this that may have led him to becoming an unwitting Russian recruit.\n\nKibet had built his life around athletics, a sport that has lifted many Kenyans like him from villages to global recognition.\n\nHe grew up in a farming family from the Mount Elgon area in western Kenya.\n\nKibet trained in Iten, the high-altitude town famed for producing Olympians and world champions, but in a competitive field he never reached that status. Instead, he competed in lesser-known 10km and half-marathon road races in Europe and Asia, according to family and friends.\n\n\"Kibet has been running since he was a child,\" his younger brother said. \"He's always been talented. Running was his life.\"\n\nBut while the sport defined his identity, it had not delivered the financial breakthrough he longed for.\n\nFriends say Kibet had been struggling financially.\n\nIn March, he asked a training partner, Elias Kiptum, to help him race in Poland, but the team that was going was already full.\n\n\"I guess that's how he ended up in Russia,\" Kiptum told the BBC.\n\nWhen, later in the year, a sports agent offered him a trip to Russia to take part in races, Kibet seized the opportunity. The BBC's calls to the agent to confirm this have not been picked up.\n\n\"He was very excited when he told me he was going to race in Russia,\" Kibet's brother said. \"Even I was happy for him. We had high expectations.\"\n\nHis cousin, Ms Chesoi, who escorted him to the bus park on the first leg of the journey at the end of July, said he carried just \"a small-sized suitcase\".\n\nKibet told his family he would only be gone for two weeks.\n\nOn the video filmed in Ukraine, Kibet says that he went to Russia as a visitor and not for a \"military job\".\n\nThen, after a fortnight, his host asked him if he would like to stay longer.\n\n\"I said: 'Yes, but the problem is that my visa is expired'. He said: 'No, I can do something for you.'\" And then he promised Kibet a job.\n\n\"In the evening, he came with some papers written in Russian. He told me: 'This is the job I want you to do.'\n\n\"I didn't know it was a military job.\"\n\nKibet says he then signed the papers and the man took his phone and passport.\n\n\"And that is how everything went wrong... that signing ruined my life.\"\n\n'Either you fight or we'll kill you'\n\nAccording to Kibet, some other people turned up and told him to get in a car. They then drove for around seven hours.\n\n\"I found myself in a military camp.\"\n\nKibet says he was informed that he had signed up to be in the army and that he had no choice.\n\n\"I was told: 'Either you go to fight or we'll kill you.'\"\n\nHe says a week of basic training followed, during which he was shown how to handle an automatic rifle. None of his commanders spoke English, so instructions came through shoves and gestures.\n\nKibet insists he never engaged in combat and then on the way to what would have been his first mission, he ditched his equipment and escaped, wandering for two days through a forest near Vovchansk in Ukraine's north-eastern Kharkiv region.\n\nHe then approached some Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n\"I went there with my hands up,\" he says repeating the gesture for the camera.\n\n\"I said: 'I am a Kenyan, please don't shoot me.'\n\n\"Everyone pointed their guns at me, but I told them to calm down. The commander came, they tied me. I told them: 'No, I am unarmed, I don't want anything. I'm here to save my life.\"\n\nDespite Kibet's family being in shock over the video, there is some relief that he is in the hands of the Ukrainians.\n\n\"We feel that he's a bit safe [with them] rather than being in Russia,\" his brother Mr Kipyego said.\n\nThe family is asking the Kenyan authorities to intervene. The ministry of foreign affairs has not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\n\"If the government of his country of origin expresses interest in his repatriation, Ukraine is open to negotiations about transferring him home,\" Ukrainian spokesperson Mr Yatsenko said.\n\nHowever, speaking about other prisoners-of-war, he added that \"most African states show little interest in the return of such citizens and do not wish to take them back\".\n\nFor Kibet's loved ones, their only priority is his safety.\n\n\"If he made a mistake, let them forgive him. We only want him back,\" his brother said.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica"

                "text": "A Kenyan court this week ordered the arrest and extradition of a British national suspected of murdering a 21-year-old woman in a town close to a United Kingdom army training camp in Kenya in 2012.\n\nThe ruling has brought renewed attention to the long-running case of the young woman, Agnes Wanjiru, whose murder in Nanyuki, central Kenya, shook her community and sparked nationwide outrage.\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nlist of 4 items\n\nlist 1 of 4Murdered Ugandan Olympian Cheptegei buried with full military honours\n\nlist 2 of 4\u2018Will I be next?\u2019: Fear haunts Kenyan women athletes after Cheptegei murder\n\nlist 3 of 4African manhood is broken \u2013 and it\u2019s costing women their lives\n\nlist 4 of 4Kenya seeks British national\u2019s arrest in septic tank murder\n\nend of list\n\nNanyuki community members have long accused British soldiers training in a garrison close to the town of gross misconduct; however, no suspects have been tried.\n\nIf the extradition goes ahead, it could mark the first time that a current or former British soldier will be extradited to face trial in another country for a civilian\u2019s murder, according to the UK\u2019s Guardian newspaper. In a statement, the UK government acknowledged the ruling and promised to cooperate with Kenyan authorities in the case.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Wanjiru\u2019s family said on Tuesday they had waited \u201ctoo long\u201d for justice but hoped that it would now arrive, according to reporting by The Associated Press (AP) news agency.\n\n\u201cWhile this is progress, it is not justice yet,\u201d family spokesperson Esther Muchiri said.\n\nWhat happened to Agnes Wanjiru?\n\nTwenty-one-year-old Wanjiru worked as a hairdresser and a sex worker in Nanyuki, her hometown.\n\nOn the night of March 31, Wanjiru disappeared. Witnesses said she was last seen in the company of British soldiers on a night out at the Lion\u2019s Court Lodge. The hotel is popular with British soldiers of the British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK), a permanent garrison in Nanyuki.\n\nTwo months later, on June 5, Wanjiru\u2019s body was found in a septic tank located close to the hotel.\n\nShe had been beaten, stabbed, and was most likely still alive when she was thrown into the septic tank, a Kenyan magistrate said in a 2019 inquest. Wanjiru\u2019s daughter, who was just a few months old, is now 13 and is being raised by her grandmother and an aunt.\n\nThe allegations against a British soldier came to light in 2021 when a Sunday Times investigation revealed that \u201cSoldier X\u201d, whom Wanjiru was last seen with, was believed to have stabbed her in the chest and abdomen. The soldier revealed his actions to colleagues and showed them where he dumped her body. At least one of them reported this to senior commanders at BATUK. It\u2019s unclear if any action was taken.\n\nThe Sunday Times\u2019 investigation revealed \u201cSoldier X\u201d and several others further poked fun at the murdered woman in Facebook posts.\n\nAttempts by her family to sue BATUK in Kenya were initially met with resistance because the British government, under the former ruling Conservative Party, claimed Kenyan courts did not have jurisdiction over UK troops. Following the Sunday Times expos\u00e9, however, the British government\u2019s stance changed.\n\nA UK parliament vote in April 2023 amended security agreements between the two countries to allow for British troops to be tried locally in Kenya. In August 2023, the Kenyan government officially launched an inquiry into Wanjiru\u2019s killing. Kenyan investigators are understood to have travelled several times to the UK since then to speak to witnesses.\n\nWhat did the court say?\n\nNairobi High Court Justice Alexander Muteti on Tuesday said there was \u201cprobable cause to order the arrest of the accused\u201d and issued a warrant for \u201cone citizen and resident of the United Kingdom\u201d.\n\nThe court did not name the suspect, a move that family members of the late woman questioned.\n\nKenya\u2019s office for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) said in a statement on X that \u201cextradition proceedings would now be initiated to ensure the suspect is brought before a Kenyan court\u201d.\n\n\u201cToday, the DPP informed the High Court that evidence gathered links the suspect, a United Kingdom citizen, to the murder,\u201d the statement read, adding that the extradition proceedings will be initiated.\n\nThe case will next be heard in court on October 21, 2025, the DPP said.\n\nWhat is BATUK?\n\nThe British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) is a permanent training support force based on the outskirts of Nanyuki that has been operating since Kenya gained independence in 1963. Thousands of British infantrymen have passed through the BATUK training camp for exercises in harsh terrain.\n\nThe unit has some 100 permanent staff and about 280 rotating short-term regiments from the UK. British troops train there as well as Kenyan troops who are part of antiterrorism squads focused on the armed group al-Shabab in neighbouring Somalia.\n\nWhile the British soldiers\u2019 presence has bolstered the local economy, there have been complaints about their conduct towards local people and the way they treat the local environment. Residents of Nanyuki complain of unexploded bombs that have detonated and maimed community members, and the presence of white phosphorus, a lethal chemical, left behind after training exercises. In one case in 2021, the chemical is believed to have started a large fire that damaged swaths of forest land.\n\nAllegations that the soldiers pay local women for sex are rife. In July 2022, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence banned soldiers from using sex workers abroad as part of efforts to curb sexual exploitation and abuse. In an August 2024 report conducted by the British army into activities at BATUK, however, officials found that soldiers there were still using sex workers at a \u201clow or moderate level\u201d.\n\nWhat has the UK government said?\n\nThe British High Commission in Kenya reiterated earlier commitments that it would cooperate with Kenyan authorities on the case, but did not confirm or deny that an extradition request for the suspect had been issued, according to the AP.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, a spokesperson for the UK government, reacting to the ruling, said: \u201cOur thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru and we remain absolutely committed to helping them secure justice.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson added: \u201cWe understand that the Kenyan director of public prosecutions has determined that a British national should face trial in relation to the murder of Ms Wanjiru in 2012.\n\n\u201cThis is subject to ongoing legal proceedings, and we will not comment further at this stage.\u201d\n\nIn April this year, UK Secretary of Defence John Healey met with Wanjiru\u2019s family and promised to help the family get \u201cthe justice they deserve\u201d."

                "text": "3 days ago\n\nGuy HedgecoeBusiness reporter, Porto de Sanabria, north-western Spain\n\nJos\u00e9 Antonio Bru\u00f1a, a honey producer, is standing on a hillside where he keeps his beehives near the small Spanish village of Porto de Sanabria.\n\nHe points to the exact spot, a few hundred metres away on the mountain opposite, where lightning struck a few weeks earlier, igniting a wildfire that had disastrous consequences.\n\n\"This August has been a nightmare for me personally, but also for the local farmers and everyone here in the village,\" he says. \"I'm 47 and I've never seen a fire that fierce.\"\n\nIt ended up burning more than 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres) of land and causing thousands of people to be evacuated from villages in this farming-heavy corner of north-western Spain, near the Portuguese border.\n\nBut it was just one of several vast blazes which have devastated Spain this summer, burning 0.8% of the country's surface area.\n\nThe most heavily affected zones were here in the north-west, including the regions of Castilla y Le\u00f3n and Galicia, plus the western region of Extremadura.\n\nHoney production, which is an important industry in rural north-west Spain, was one of the main casualties of the summer. Mr Bru\u00f1a knows people who have lost up to 400 beehives in the fires.\n\nFortunately, his own 1,500 hives are intact, because the fire stopped just metres away from the fields where he keeps them. But the damage caused to nearby flora will have serious repercussions for his business.\n\n\"I calculate that this year I'm going to lose 50% of my honey production, at the very least, because of the fires, and the following year the same, or even worse,\" Mr Bru\u00f1a says. This is because of the time it will take for the flowers that bees need to grow back again in surrounding fields.\n\n\"There are some types of flower that won't appear again for three years,\" he explains.\n\nThe lack of structural damage to his hives means he cannot claim insurance. He is considering moving many of them elsewhere, in the hope of improving the bees' chances of survival and reducing his future losses.\n\nMany livestock farmers have also been forced to move their animals in recent weeks, both to avoid fires and to ensure they can access unburned pasture.\n\n\"Things couldn't have been worse for farmers [this summer], it was one fire after another,\" says Fernando Garc\u00eda, a cow farmer from Castromil, a village on the border between Castilla y Le\u00f3n and Galicia.\n\nHe spoke after spending hours working with local volunteers and firefighters to bring under control yet another blaze, on the edge of the village.\n\nMr Garc\u00eda has lost around 30 cattle this summer, most recently having to put down 11 animals which had suffered severe burns. At times, he has even kept his cows enclosed instead of letting them roam, because of fears about the fires.\n\n\"All of this has had a big economic impact, but the biggest impact of all is that we can't sleep at night,\" he says. \"It's a constant tension.\"\n\nAlthough farmers like Mr Garc\u00eda expect to receive insurance payments, he believes there will be a knock-on cost.\n\n\"They may pay us, but next year, instead of costing us, for example, \u20ac5,000 [$5,858; \u00a34,328], insurance premiums will cost \u20ac10,000 or \u20ac15,000,\" he says. \"Because insurance companies don't want to lose money.\"\n\nThe COAG national farmers' association estimated in August, when several large fires were still burning, that the industry had suffered damages worth at least \u20ac600m.\n\nThe biggest costs have been burned fields and properties and deaths of animals. However, there are other substantial damages, such as to beehives, and antennae used by farmers to locate their animals.\n\nFarmers' representatives are currently locked in negotiations with regional governments over how much public money should be paid out to help the sector recover.\n\nThe other main economic victim of this summer's fires has been tourism, which represents 13% of Spanish GDP and has been a motor of the country's strong recent growth.\n\nAlthough most of the coastal areas which are associated with tourism avoided fires this summer, the southern province of C\u00e1diz was an exception as hotels, holiday homes and camping sites were evacuated because of blazes.\n\nAnd this summer's main wildfire hotspots, in the west and north-west, have developed rural tourism in recent years as an alternative to the beach holidays for which Spain used to be known.\n\nHiking is popular here, for example along the Camino de Santiago trail or in the area's mountain ranges, as is wine and food related tourism.\n\nSanabria Lake, the largest glacial body of water in the Iberian peninsula, is a major local attraction, surrounded by a natural park. But the spread of the fire that began in Porto de Sanabria in mid-August caused it to be shut down. And many tourists left the area, as smoke filled the air in nearby towns.\n\n\"In August, this area was at full capacity in terms of tourism and people who have second homes here,\" says Miguel \u00c1ngel Martos, the mayor of Galende, which is a few minutes' drive from the lake.\n\n\"And then, on 18 August, it dropped down to 10% of capacity.\"\n\nFor tourists this was inconvenient. But for many locals it spelled financial disaster. Among them was \u00d3scar David Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez, who has a contract to hire two bar-restaurants on the shores of the lake.\n\nHe estimates that during the second half of August, when the local authorities closed down the lake, he lost \u20ac80,000, because of the rental of the bars, the wages and social security payments of his 14 employees, and the food which he had bought but which could not be sold.\n\n\"The regional government has said it will pay me \u20ac5,500,\" he says, laughing bitterly at the thought. \"They are going to have to come up with some other kind of compensation because I didn't want to close, they forced me to.\"\n\nThe Hosteltur, a news platform that reports on the tourism industry, warned that the damage caused by the wildfires in such areas \"is not limited to the material impact, but also the impact on the image\u2026 of these destinations\".\n\nThis summer has underlined the now-infamous schism between urban and rural Spain. Decades of migration from rural areas, such as those hardest hit by this summer's fires, to urban hubs means that 90% of the Spanish population now inhabits just 30% of its territory.\n\nThe rest has become known as la Espa\u00f1a vac\u00eda, or \"empty Spain\", where a sparse population has often complained about a lack of infrastructure, transport links, and schools, as well as the imposition of EU environmental and sanitary regulations for farmers.\n\nThe fires, which have been particularly uncontainable this year, only compound that discontent.\n\nIn Castromil, local man Miguel \u00c1ngel Garc\u00eda Di\u00e9guez summed up the feelings of many people in rural areas who have watched the wildfires in horror this summer.\n\n\"It's hard enough as it is to survive because of the price of animal feed and fuel \u2013 every day it's more difficult for farmers to get by,\" he says. \"And then on top that, this happens.\""

                "text": "Indonesia will ban the construction of new hotels and restaurants built atop cleared rice fields and agricultural land on the popular resort island of Bali, after recent flash flooding killed at least 18 people.\n\nA state of emergency was declared on Bali on 10 September after the island experienced the most severe flooding in more than a decade.\n\nTriggered by heavy rainfall, the flooding caused extensive damage to homes, public facilities and infrastructure and affected thousands across Denpasar and its surrounding areas.\n\nEnvironmental activists have long sounded the alarm about the impacts of mass tourism on the island, saying stricter controls to prevent land conversion would reduce the risks from flooding and other natural disasters.\n\nIn the wake of the floods the Bali governor, Wayan Koster, said this week that new rules had been issued.\n\n\u201cStarting this year, yes, there is already an instruction to all heads of districts and mayors across Bali,\u201d he said on 14 September.\n\n\u201cAfter handling the floods, we will meet again to ensure no more permits are issued for hotels, restaurants or other facilities on productive land, especially rice fields,\u201d he said, as quoted by Indonesia\u2019s state news agency, Antara.\n\n\u201cStarting this year, the land conversion ban will align with Bali\u2019s 100-year plan. From 2025 onward, no productive land can be converted into commercial facilities.\u201d\n\nFamous for its lush, green rice paddies and stunning beaches, the \u201cisland of the Gods\u201d has undergone rapid change over the past half-century with locals and tourists complaining about the traffic, pollution and badly behaved foreigners that have come with the hotels and resorts that now swamp the island.\n\nIndonesia said last year that it would place a moratorium on new hotels amid fears of overdevelopment, but the plan failed to eventuate. The new bylaws are expected to be brought into effect by the end of 2025.\n\nThe move follows a warning from Indonesia\u2019s meteorology and climate agency about the potential for an extreme rainy season this year, and a worsening waste crisis that has aggravated flooding in several regions, including Bali.\n\nFlooding is common in Indonesia during the wet season, which typically runs from September to March.\n\nHowever, scientists say the climate crisis is intensifying the rainy season, bringing heavier rainfall and more frequent flash floods. Overdevelopment and widespread deforestation are believed to be worsening the impact of flooding.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s environmental minister, Hanif Faisal Nurofiq, said after the floods that the new bylaws were an important step for the island.\n\n\u201cThis is also crucial for Bali\u2019s tourism as the recent flooding has drawn serious attention,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI actually told the governor last week that I really hope he will immediately stop the land conversions in Bali. This is extremely important.\u201d\n\nExtreme rainfall is more common and more intense because of human-caused climate breakdown across most of the world, particularly in Europe, most of Asia, central and eastern North America, and parts of South America, Africa and Australia.\n\nThis is because warmer air can hold more water vapour. Flooding has most likely become more frequent and severe in these locations as a result, but is also affected by human factors, such as the existence of flood defences and land use."

                "text": "2 days ago\n\nSarah SmithNorth America editor\n\nThere is little doubt that Donald Trump was more enthused about the day he spent at Windsor Castle than his talks with Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers.\n\nAnd that is no slight on the UK prime minister's hospitality during this state visit, which Trump and his team have been eager to praise.\n\nStarmer's country residence is undoubtedly an impressive meeting place, and there was even an aerial display by the British Army's Red Devils who flew enormous British and American flags to welcome the US leader to the Buckinghamshire countryside.\n\nBut as much as Trump appears to genuinely like Starmer, with their warm relationship on display at a joint news conference on Thursday, the president was totally beguiled by being hosted by the King and Queen on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, his definitive highlight of the trip was the elaborate evening banquet for 160 guests in Windsor Castle's St George's Hall that evening.\n\nFor Trump, who has a deep and longstanding admiration for the Royals, it is hard to compete with being toasted by the King. No matter how many jets are laid on for you in the skies above Chequers.\n\nState visits like these allow presidents and prime ministers to connect with one other on a more personal level, and offer a chance for their respective staff to build working relationships. They are also an opportunity to demonstrate the closeness of relations on a big stage.\n\nIn this sense, it was smooth sailing for both sides.\n\nKey takeaways from Trump-Starmer news conference\n\nTrump suggests Starmer could use military to control UK borders\n\nIn pictures: Trump and Melania meet royals at Windsor\n\nThere was no real awkwardness during the joint news conference, which had the potential to expose areas of disagreements.\n\nWhen the two men were asked about one of those issues, the UK's plan to recognise Palestinian statehood, Trump said he disagreed but also gave Starmer a big smile and a warm slap on the back as the prime minister condemned Hamas.\n\nAnd on another potentially tricky topic, the sacking of Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to the US over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, Trump was unusually taciturn. He said very little and immediately deferred to Starmer.\n\nThe two leaders did discuss Gaza and Ukraine when they spent almost an hour talking alone without any of their staff in the room. And while they were very amicable during the news conference, it also quickly became clear that neither had changed their positions on the key issues where they disagree.\n\nThere are limits to how much influence any leader can have on Trump, regardless of the success of a trip such as this.\n\nInside Chequers, I asked Wiles, the president's chief-of-staff, how much difference the visit will make to Britain's ability to influence US policy on trade, tariffs and international affairs. Her response was frank \u2013 none at all.\n\nHowever much Trump enjoyed this state visit, he is not going to alter his positions on important global matters because of a memorable night spent at Windsor Castle.\n\nBut after all the pomp and pageantry, Starmer appears to have at least earned the right to respectfully disagree with Trump without paying a diplomatic penalty.\n\nIt can be costly to get on the wrong side of the US president, but by carefully navigating the relationship the UK has managed to avoid the punishingly high trade tariffs that have been imposed on other nations. Starmer, meanwhile, has not been subjected to a humiliating dressing down or given a derogatory nickname.\n\nWhile this was never going to descend into the kind of awkward clash we've seen at times in the Oval Office this year - not just with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky but with other leaders too - it is notable that a more relaxed Trump approached the questions during the concluding news conference in a far less combative way than he often does back in Washington.\n\nDid the UK prime minister play his \"trump\" card by arranging this lavish state visit? It was choreographed flawlessly and clearly delighted Trump and the first lady.\n\nAnd while Starmer may not have won the ability to change the president's mind, a falling out now feels further away than ever before."

An armed group called The Resistance Front (TRF), which demands independence for Kashmir, claimed responsibility for the attack, but India had alleged Pakistani involvement.\n\nPakistan denied any role in the attacks and asked for an independent investigation to be carried out.\n\nTwo days later, Pakistan responded to the missile strikes by attacking military installations across its frontier with India and Indian-administered Kashmir, striking at least four facilities.\n\nThe conflict ended four days later, thanks to an internationally-brokered ceasefire.\n\nWhile the exchange of aerial fire came to a halt, the diplomatic ties between the neighbours remained suspended, and the political tension spilled over into cricket as India\u2019s players walked off the field without shaking hands with their opposition.\n\nA few moments later, Pakistan\u2019s players trudged off in a group and waited for the Indian squad and support staff to come out and shake hands, as is the norm at the end of cricket matches.\n\nHowever, the Indian contingent only shook hands with each other before walking into their dressing room and shutting the door as the waiting Pakistan players looked on.\n\nShortly after the events unfolded, Pakistan\u2019s manager Naveed Akram Cheema lodged a protest against the Indian cricket team\u2019s actions with Andy Pycroft, who is an International Cricket Council (ICC) accredited match referee.\n\nPakistan alleged that Pycroft did not clearly communicate the Indian team\u2019s decision to not partake in the handshake, an act they termed in contravention of the spirit of cricket.\n\nPakistan demanded Pycroft\u2019s removal as match referee for their remaining fixtures in the tournament, but later reached an agreement with the ICC and Pycroft went on to officiate Pakistan\u2019s last group game against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Wednesday.\n\nThe Pakistan-UAE match was delayed by an hour as officials from the ICC and Pakistan\u2019s team management held a meeting at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium before the match.\n\n\u201cThe ICC\u2019s match referee, Andy Pycroft, has apologised to the manager and captain of the Pakistan cricket team,\u201d the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAndy Pycroft termed the September 14 incident a result of miscommunication.\u201d\n\nThe PCB also said that the ICC \u201cexpressed its willingness to conduct an inquiry into the code of conduct violation that occurred during the September 14 match\u201d, referring to Pycroft\u2019s request to Pakistan and India captains to avoid the customary handshake at the toss, which the PCB alleges contravened the laws of the game.\n\nHowever, a source within the ICC told Al Jazeera that Pycroft did not apologise to Pakistan and only clarified his position.\n\nThe source also said that the ICC had investigated the issue and concluded that it did not warrant action against the Zimbabwean match referee.\n\nThe Zimbabwean match official will be in charge of Sunday\u2019s India-Pakistan fixture as well."

                "text": "As nationalistic rivalries go, few run as deep as India and Pakistan. But even as the neighbours fought wars against each other, carried out rival nuclear tests and conducted nightly shows of strength along their heavily militarised border, there was always one thing that brought them together: cricket.\n\nBut as the two sides came together on Sunday for a match in the Asia Cup tournament, the camaraderie that was once celebrated as cricket diplomacy had vanished.\n\nAt the end of the game \u2013 after India had won a crushing triumph \u2013 instead of the usual respectful handshake between the two sides, the Indian team simply walked off the field.\n\nThe match was the first meeting of the Indian and Pakistani teams since Delhi accused Islamabad of masterminding a terrorist attack in the disputed Indian region of Kashmir in April, which killed 26 people. Pakistan denied any involvement.\n\nIndia launched an armed response and fired missiles into Pakistan, leading to four days of tit-for-tat hostilities and exchanges of fire in May that pushed the two nuclear-armed countries closer to all-out war than they had been in decades.\n\nSpeaking after the match, India\u2019s captain, Suryakumar Yadav, said the decision not to shake hands had been a \u201cteam call\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe had come only to play,\u201d Yadav told Indian media. \u201cSome things are beyond sportsmanship. We dedicate this victory to our armed forces who took part in Operation Sindoor and stand with families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.\u201d\n\nIn response, Pakistan\u2019s captain, Salman Ali Agha, did not attend the post-match ceremony. Pakistan\u2019s coach, the New Zealander Mike Hesson, said their side had been \u201cready to shake hands at the end of the game. We were disappointed that our opposition didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nIndia\u2019s actions were met with outrage in Pakistan. The team lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council, calling for the referee to be removed \u2013 a demand the ICC refused. In a statement afterwards, the chair of the Pakistan Cricket Board, Mohsin Naqvi, said it was \u201cutterly disappointing to witness the lack of sportsmanship today\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have always advocated for sports and politics to be kept apart,\u201d Naqvi said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cCricket is a global sport that should unite rather than divide. Our concern has never been about individuals or governments, but about ensuring clarity, fairness in match protocols, and upholding the spirit of the game.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday night, amid threats by the Pakistan team to boycott the rest of the Asia Cup tournament, the match referee, Andy Pycroft, apologised to Agha, describing the handshake incident as a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d.\n\nAfter both sides qualified for the second group stage of the tournament, they will meet again on Sunday.\n\nObservers said last week\u2019s incident signalled the clear demise of cricket diplomacy \u2013 which until recently had helped keep politics off the field even at the lowest moments \u2013 and was evidence of just how much Indo-Pakistan relations had soured.\n\nIn 1987, Pakistan\u2019s president, the army general Zia-ul-Haq, made a surprise visit to India to watch a Test match \u2013 part of what he called a \u201ccricket for peace\u201d initiative \u2013 as tensions were rising between the two countries.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2007, the two countries played four successful Test series on each other\u2019s turf. In 2004, as the Indian team travelled to Pakistan, the Indian prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told them: \u201cWhether you win or lose doesn\u2019t matter to me, but while you are there, you must win the hearts of the Pakistani people.\u201d\n\nHowever, since the Mumbai attacks of 2008, which were orchestrated by terrorist groups operating from Pakistan, such cross-border sportsmanship has been increasingly rare, with cricket and politics becoming visibly intertwined in both countries.\n\nUnder India\u2019s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, who was elected in 2014, cricket has become increasingly utilised as a political tool. The country\u2019s largest cricket stadium was named after the prime minister, while the ICC, the sport\u2019s powerful global governing body, is run by Jay Shah, the son of India\u2019s home minister and Modi\u2019s closest ally, Amit Shah.\n\nIn Pakistan, where the heavily jingoistic and anti-India military governs behind the scenes, the cricket board chair, Naqvi, is also the minister of the interior.\n\nSushant Singh, an Indian defence analyst who previously served in the Indian army, said that \u201cinstead of building fraternal ties and people-to-people contact\u201d, the cricket field had now become \u201cthe site of playing out nationalist fantasies\u201d.\n\nThe former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi, who travelled to India several times for matches and described himself as a \u201cstaunch supporter of cricket diplomacy\u201d lamented its loss. He said every time he had played over the border he \u201creceived a lot of love and support from Indians\u201d and that in his two decades of playing, had \u201cnever witnessed such off-the-field behaviour from Indian players\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the past, the wars and conflict between both countries did not stop cricket matches,\u201d said Afridi. \u201cWe greeted each other with respect on the field and we did not see hatred among players. Even during tough times such as the Kargil conflict, we remained welcoming to each other and enjoyed meeting off the field as sportsmen.\u201d\n\nOsman Samiuddin, a senior editor at ESPNCricinfo and author of The Unquiet Ones: A History of Pakistan Cricket, said the two countries were now in an era where \u201cthe opposite of cricket diplomacy is happening\u201d.\n\nCiting other recent examples, such when India refused to travel to Pakistan for this year\u2019s Champions Trophy, he said: \u201cThey are actually now taking out their hostility through cricket \u2013 it\u2019s become both a vehicle and a proxy for the tense relations between the two countries.\u201d\n\nHe warned that India\u2019s actions at Sunday\u2019s match, and the refusal by the ICC to censure the captain for it, could set a \u201ca dangerous precedent for other players in the future\u201d when it came to keeping politics out of the game.\n\nSamiuddin said that given the regimes in both countries, he did not see a return of the old sporting camaraderie, on or off the field, anytime soon. \u201cI just don\u2019t think the political conditions in either country are encouraging enough for it.\u201d"

Last week, the Daily Record revealed that Watt had been convicted of abusing two former girlfriends in 2018.\n\nThere was a significant police presence and febrile atmosphere with the \u2018unity\u2019 protesters blocked in at the top of Buchanan Street, while the larger group of counter-protesters amassed further down the pedestrian thoroughfare. Those making speeches to the anti-immigration protest struggled to make themselves heard above chants of \u201cshame on you\u201d and heavy beats from the anti-racists\u2019 superior sound system, which blasted out sing-a-long hits by Abba and Chappell Roan.\n\nStanding by the steps leading up to the concert hall, three women held aloft a banner bearing a colourful portrait of the far-right Christian activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated two weeks ago in Utah. They praised Kirk, saying \u201che wasn\u2019t scared to say what other people are afraid to say\u201d and bemoaned lack of Christian teaching in modern Scottish schools while \u201ctoo many other religions are being brought in\u201d.\n\nOne of the women, Laura Dunsmore, a nurse, said it was important to emphasise that the protest wasn\u2019t only about illegal immigration. \u201cIt\u2019s about the state of the country, the state of the world. You can\u2019t access healthcare, our streets are crumbling. We can\u2019t vote our way out of this. We need change at a higher level.\u201d\n\nFurther down the wide street, holding a handmade placard reading \u201cThis mum welcomes refugees\u201d, Cat, a software technician from Glasgow\u2019s southside, was jigging to pop hits along with her partner and baby. \u201cI felt I should lean in to the \u2018mum\u2019 bit especially because they are saying they want to protect women and children, and as a woman and a mum I\u2019m not worried about asylum seekers.

Fetching water can involve journeys of many hours each day across hot terrain devoid of vegetation.\n\nAbout 70% to 80% of the community\u2019s diet comes from animal sources, mostly milk, blood and meat, reflecting resourcefulness and adaptation to scarcity, which is common among pastoralist societies around the world living in environments where crops cannot grow and where markets are too far away to be accessed on foot.\n\nYet, after years of documenting the Turkana people\u2019s lifestyle and studying blood and urine samples to assess their health, researchers found that, although the community consumes too much purine, which should lead to gout, the condition rarely appears among the Turkana.\n\n\u201cAbout 90% of the people assessed were dehydrated but generally healthy,\u201d said Prof Julien Ayroles, from the University of California, Berkeley, one of the project\u2019s co-principal investigators. \u201cThe Turkana have maintained their traditional way of life for thousands of years, providing us with an extraordinary window into human adaptation.\u201d\n\nGenetic adaptations are believed to have emerged about 5,000 years ago, coinciding with the aridification of northern Africa, the study suggesting that as the region became drier, natural selection favoured variants that enhanced survival under arid conditions.\n\n\u201cThis research demonstrates how our ancestors adapted to dramatic climate shifts through genetic evolution,\u201d said Dr Epem Esekon, responsible for Turkana county\u2019s health and sanitation sector.\n\nHowever, as more members of the Turkana community move to towns and cities, the same adaptations that once protected them may now increase risks of chronic lifestyle diseases, a phenomenon known as \u201cevolutionary mismatch\u201d. This occurs when adaptations shaped by one environment become liabilities in another, highlighting how rapid lifestyle changes interact with deep evolutionary history.\n\nWhen the researchers compared biomarkers and gene expression \u2013 the process by which information encoded in a gene is turned into a function \u2013 in the genomes of city-dwelling Turkana people with their kin still living in the villages, they found an imbalance of gene expression that may predispose them to chronic diseases such as hypertension or obesity, which are more common in urban settings where diets, water availability and activity patterns are radically different.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding these adaptations will guide health programmes for the Turkana, especially as some shift from traditional pastoralism to city life,\u201d said Miano.\n\nAs the world faces rapid environmental change, the Turkana people\u2019s story offers inspiration and practical insights. For generations, the researchers said, this community has developed and maintained sophisticated strategies for surviving in a challenging and variable environment, knowledge that becomes increasingly valuable as the climate crisis creates new survival challenges.\n\nFor close to a decade, the project centred on co-production of knowledge, combining genomic science with ecological and anthropological expertise. The agenda emerged from dialogue with Turkana elders, scientists, chiefs and community members, conversations about health, diet and change, often in the evening around a campfire.\n\n\u201cWorking with the Turkana has been transformative for this study,\u201d said Dr Sospeter Ngoci Njeru, a co-principal investigator and deputy director at Kemri\u2019s Centre for Community Driven Research. \u201cTheir insights into their environment, lifestyle and health have been essential to connecting our genetic findings to real-world biology and survival strategies.\u201d\n\nDr Dino Martins, director of the TBI, says the deep ecological connection and the adaptation to one of the Earth\u2019s hottest and most arid environments provides lessons for how climate continues to shape human biology and health. \u201cThe discovery adds another important piece of knowledge to our wider understanding of human evolution,\u201d he said.\n\nResearchers say other pastoralist communities in similar environments in east Africa, including the Rendille, Samburu, Borana, Merille, Karamojong and Toposa, are likely to share this adaptation.\n\nThe research team will create a podcast in the Turkana language to share the study\u2019s findings and also plan to offer the community practical health considerations that arise from rapidly changing lifestyles."

He is among more than four million people who have returned from Iran and Pakistan since September 2023, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\n\nThe August 31 earthquake killed about 2,200 people and destroyed more than 5,000 homes, compounding a widespread economic crisis.\n\n\u201cWe lost everything we have worked for in Pakistan, and now we lost everything here,\u201d Din adds.\n\nUntil four months ago, he had been living in Daska, a city in Pakistan\u2019s Sialkot District, for eight years after fleeing his village in Afghanistan when ISIL (ISIS) fighters told him to join them or leave.\n\n\u201cI refused to join ISIL and I was forced to migrate to Pakistan,\u201d he explains.\n\nHis exile ended abruptly this year as the Pakistani government continues its nationwide crackdown on undocumented foreign nationals.\n\nHe describes how Pakistani police raided his house, taking him and his family to a camp to be processed for deportation. \u201cI returned from Pakistan as we were told our time there was finished and we had to leave,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe had to spend two nights at Torkham border crossing until we were registered by Afghan authorities, before we could return to our village.\u201d\n\nThis struggle is echoed across Kunar. Some 12km from Noorgal, in the village of Barabat, 58-year-old Sadat Khan sits next to the rubble of the home he had been renting until the earthquake struck.\n\nKhan returned from Pakistan willingly as his health was failing and he could no longer find work to support his wife and seven children. Now, the earthquake has taken what little he had left.\n\n\u201cI was poor in Pakistan as well. I was the only one working and my entire family was depending on me,\u201d he tells Al Jazeera. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the next meal will come from. There is no work here. And I have problems with my lungs. I have trouble breathing if I do more effort.\u201d\n\nHe says his request to local authorities for a tent for his family has so far gone unanswered.\n\n\u201cI went to the authorities to request a tent to install here,\u201d he says. \u201cWe haven\u2019t received anything, so I asked someone to give me a room for a while, for my children. My uncle had mercy on me and let me stay in one room in his house, now that the winter is coming.\u201d\n\nOne crisis out of many\n\nThe earthquake is only the most visible of the crises that returnees from Iran and Pakistan are facing.\n\n\u201cOur land is barren, and we have no stream or river close to the village,\u201d says Din. \u201cOur farming and our life depend entirely on rainfall, and we haven\u2019t seen much of it lately. Other people wonder how can we live there with such severe water shortage.\u201d\n\nDr Farida Safi, a nutritionist working at a field hospital set up by Islamic Relief in Diwa Gul valley after the quake, says malnutrition is becoming a major problem.\n\n\u201cMost of the people affected by the quake that come to us have food deficiency, mostly due to the poor diet and the lack of proper nutrition they had access to in their village,\u201d she explains. \u201cWe have to treat many malnourished children.\u201d\n\nKunar\u2019s Governor, Mawlawi Qudratullah, told Al Jazeera that the Kunar authorities have started building a new town that will include 382 residential plots, according to the plan.\n\nThis initiative in Khas Kunar district is part of the national programmes directed by the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing, with an objective of providing permanent housing for Afghan returnees. However, it is unclear how long it will take to build these new homes or if farmland will also be given to returnees.\n\n\u201cIt will be for those people who don\u2019t have any land or house in this province,\u201d Qudratullah said. \u201cAnd this project has already started, separate from the crisis response to the earthquake.\u201d\n\nBut for those living in or next to the ruins of their old homes, such promises feel distant. Back in Noorgal, Nawab Din is consumed by the immediate fear of aftershocks from the earthquake and the uncertainty of what comes next.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the government will relocate us down in the plains or if they will help us rebuild,\u201d he says, his voice heavy with exhaustion. \u201cBut I fear we might be forced to continue to live in a camp, even as aftershocks continue to hit, sometimes so powerful that the tents shake.\u201d"

There is little place for them in Petra as it is transformed by a major development programme that aims to build new facilities, regulate an anarchic tourist trade and provide a better experience for the hundreds of thousands of visitors drawn to the ancient site.\n\nFeras\u2019s home, which he shares with his wife and nine children, comprises four connected 2,400-year-old caves and an adjoining tent. Just a 10-minute walk away are the remains of Petra\u2019s grand temple and its colonnaded main street. It is also just a short hike from the monument known as the Treasury, made more famous by the 1989 blockbuster Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\n\nThe caves occupied by the Bdoul were originally an integral part of a wealthy trading city \u2013 the thriving capital of the Nabateans for 500 years before it was annexed by the Romans in around AD100 and eventually abandoned three centuries later.\n\nInternational human rights campaigners have called on Jordanian authorities to halt looming evictions. \u201cJordan\u2019s displacement of the Bdoul from their historic homes in Petra puts their culture at risk,\u201d said Adam Coogle, a Middle East and north Africa deputy director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe Jordanian government should halt the relocations and respect the rights of Petra\u2019s Bedouin community.\u201d\n\nOfficials charged with the management and development of Petra say the Bdoul who still live on the site are there illegally. They contend that many have alternative accommodation and that their use of the caves as homes, animal shelters, shops and storerooms risks causing irreparable harm.\n\n\u201cIf we want to preserve the integrity of the site for future generations then we have to stop the use of the caves for damaging activities,\u201d said Dr Fares Braizat, the chief commissioner of the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority. \u201cEveryone in the site, whoever they are, has to abide by the law, and it is illegal for anyone to live in or use the archaeological monuments within the [site of Petra] for whatever purposes.\u201d\n\nHistorians say the Bdoul have lived in Petra\u2019s caves for about 200 years. Efforts to remove the community from the site began shortly after its classification by the United Nations as a world heritage site in 1985. Then, in a deal negotiated with community leaders, thousands of people were moved to a purpose-built village nearby. Some evaded the relocation or have since moved back to their cave homes.\n\nIn recent years, with tourism a major contributor to Jordan\u2019s flagging economy, big investments have been made at Petra. There is a new museum, cultural village and network of walking trails. Hundreds of stalls that choked the site have been cleared away, as have guides who harassed visitors. An effort has been made to cut down on overnight stays in caves being offered to tourists on social media or popular booking sites.\n\nThe new campaign to clear the caves began in late 2024 and targeted a dozen or so extended families now living around the Sutuh al-Nabi Harun mountain. The Jordanian authorities have been accused by campaigners of using \u201ccoercive tactics\u201d.\n\nFeras, who earns a thin living from farming goats and sheep and occasionally acting as an guide, has rejected an offer from authorities of a house in the village where other Bdoul from Petra are now living. He said he was sent to prison earlier this year for failing to pay a heavy fine for destroying a heritage site. He was released after two weeks but now faces a new court hearing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to accuse us of damaging the caves,\u201d Feras said. \u201cWe are their guardians. We are not destroying anything. We just live the way we have lived for hundreds of years.\u201d\n\nYasin Ahmed , one of Feras\u2019s neighbours, said he had also received a court summons, as well as fines totalling tens of thousands of dollars, which he too could not pay.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t have that kind of money. I am not wealthy,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up here and I don\u2019t know anything else. I can\u2019t survive in a house in a village \u2026 They are offering only a very small house but I have 10 children.\u201d\n\nThe tourist trade in Jordan has been badly hit by the war in Gaza, with the number of visitors to Petra falling dramatically. The Bdoul who made a living from guiding tourists or selling souvenirs or soft drinks have lost much of their income.\n\nRayya Hussein, 85, has sworn never to leave her cave home, where she has lived all her life. Her parents are buried in the mountains close by. \u201cIf they want to force me to move out, I will go up on the mountain and jump,\u201d she said.\n\nDr Olivia Mason, a political geographer at Newcastle University who has researched Petra and its development, said authorities saw the Bdoul as a nuisance, despite the UN making clear that their cultural heritage was an integral part of the site\u2019s significance.\n\n\u201cAt the moment it\u2019s the Jordanian authorities against the Bdoul, and no one acknowledges that they can work together,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThere has to be some level of development, but that shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of the local community.\u201d\n\nBraizat said authorities had already promised some very elderly inhabitants that they could stay in their caves if they wanted to, and that the government-built houses offered to the Bdoul were adequately sized, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.\n\nHe admitted there was limited funding available for new housing in or near the existing and overcrowded village established for the community, but said there was a project to offer the Bdoul alternative livelihoods.\n\n\u201cWe are shouldering our responsibilities to give these people a better life, with access to schools, roads, hospitals and everything that they need,\u201d Braizat said.\n\nBut to many of the Bdoul such words mean little. \u201cWe have lived here all our lives. Our freedom is being outside,\u201d Feras said. \u201cHere the children have freedom to go out with the sheep and run over the mountain. This is our soil.\u201d\n\nSome names have been changed to protect identities"

It was the first time the Justice Department said it was bringing a capital case after President Donald Trump returned to office Jan. 20 with a pledge to revive federal executions, which his predecessor Biden had put on hold.\n\nMangione\u2019s lawyers argue that Bondi\u2019s announcement \u2014 which she followed with Instagram posts and a TV appearance \u2014 showed the decision was \u201cbased on politics, not merit\u201d and, they said, her remarks tainted the grand jury process that resulted in his indictment a few weeks later.\n\nTrump, who oversaw an unprecedented run of 13 executions at the end of his first term, offered his own opinions about Mangione on Thursday \u2014 despite court rules that prohibit any pretrial publicity that could interfere with a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\n\n\u201cThink about Mangione. He shot someone in the back, as clear as you\u2019re looking at me or I\u2019m looking at you. He shot \u2014 he looked like a pure assassin,\u201d Trump told Fox News.\n\n\u201cThere is a high bar to dismissing an indictment due to pretrial publicity,\u201d Mangione\u2019s lawyers wrote in their 114-page filing. \u201cHowever, there has never been a situation remotely like this one where prejudice has been so great against a death-eligible defendant.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors have until Oct. 31 to respond. Mangione is due back in court in the federal case Dec. 5, days after the start of pretrial hearings in his state case. No trial date has been set for either case.\n\nMangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges.\n\nDueling prosecutions, dismissed charges and a devoted following\n\nSurveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson, 50, from behind on Dec. 4, 2024, as he arrived to a Manhattan hotel for his company\u2019s annual investor conference. Police say \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.\n\nMangione, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan. Authorities say he had a 9 mm handgun and a notebook describing his intent to \u201cwack\u201d an insurance executive.\n\nMangione\u2019s lawyers contend the simultaneous prosecutions amount to double jeopardy.\n\nIn the federal case, Mangione is charged with murder through use of a firearm, which carries the possibility of the death penalty, as well as stalking and gun offenses.\n\nOn Tuesday, the judge in his state case threw out terrorism charges that carried the possibility of a mandatory life sentence without parole. But Judge Gregory Carro rejected the defense\u2019s request to dismiss the state prosecution entirely, saying the double jeopardy argument is premature because neither case has gone to trial or resulted in a guilty plea.\n\nThe state case will proceed with other charges, including an intentional murder count that carries a potential punishment of 15 years to life in prison, with the possibility of parole. Unlike the federal system, New York does not have the death penalty.\n\nMangione has attracted a cult following as a stand-in for frustrations with the health insurance industry.\n\nA few dozen supporters \u2014 mostly women \u2014 packed three rows in the rear of the courtroom gallery at his hearing Tuesday in state court. Some wore green, the color of the Mario Bros. video game character Luigi, and one woman sported a \u201cFREE LUIGI\u201d T-shirt."

Two deaths occurred in South Australia and two in WA.\n\nRue said that WA police advised Optus that they believed the \u201cindividual likely attempted to contact triple zero for assistance\u201d, adding that the company would work with authorities to \u201cunderstand more of what has occurred\u201d.\n\nThe CEO earlier confirmed that two customers had called Optus during the outage on Thursday to warn the telco that triple zero calls were not working, but the complaints were not escalated.\n\nRue told reporters on Saturday afternoon: \u201cWe now know we were informed by two individuals that they could not connect into triple zero, and this information was not surfaced with the relevant escalation at that time.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarly review suggests that we had not handled these calls as would be expected,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, said triple zero calls were out of action for 10 hours \u2013 eight hours longer than Optus initially claimed \u2013 but Rue confirmed on Saturday afternoon the timeframe was more than 13 hours.\n\nThe CEO confirmed the planned technical upgrade began at 12.30am on Thursday but was cut short at 1.50pm after the telco was notified by SA police that there was an problem.\n\n\u201cOnce notified, we stopped the upgrade, restoring triple zero, and began to confirm with relevant stakeholders, such as police and other regulatory and government agencies and departments that we had experienced an outage impacting triple zero,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nRue said Optus commenced welfare checks, and during which it learned three people had died during the outage.\n\n\u201cOnce we had this information and were confident of its accuracy, we shared this with our board, with the ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority), the federal government and other bodies,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday, the federal government confirmed the ACMA would conduct an investigation.\n\nSA police, which had also worked through Friday night conducting welfare checks on 150 people whose triple zero calls failed, confirmed an eight-week-old boy from Gawler, on Adelaide\u2019s northern fringe, and a 68-year-old woman from Queenstown, a suburb in the city\u2019s north-west, had died during the outage.\n\nThe third death linked to the outage, which involved up to 600 attempted triple zero calls, was a 74-year-old Western Australian man, the state government confirmed on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking and it is completely unacceptable that people\u2019s lives have been put at risk, and of course, with deep sadness, I can confirm that one 74-year-old man has passed away,\u201d Labor minister John Carey said at a press conference.\n\n\u201cWA police are now making safety checks on the calls that did not get through, and they\u2019re working through that.\u201d\n\nMalinauskas said he was not informed about the outage until Optus had commenced a press conference announcing it to the public. He told reporters he had never witnessed \u201csuch incompetence\u201d from an Australian communications company.\n\nThe premier said that only after its press conference on Friday did Optus give SA police the details, including the names of the deceased.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to make sure they\u2019re letting our emergency services know \u2026 all the information the moment they have it, before they think about crafting a media statement,\u201d Malinauskas said.\n\n\u201cIt is somewhat extraordinary we had a situation (on Friday) after everything that had unfolded, that we were still struggling to get information from Optus to allow police to do their work.\u201d\n\nCarey echoed the premier\u2019s words on Saturday. \u201cIt is unbelievable, and the way that Optus has even just released the news, I think, is appalling.\u201d\n\nRue said on Saturday afternoon that he had asked his team to make a plan for establishing a formal notification process between the telco and authorities during such incidents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that the lack of this process led to the late notification of the premiers and chief ministers,\u201d he said, confirming they were contacted at the same time as Friday\u2019s press conference was held.\n\n\u201cOptus will be appointing an independent person to lead a review into this entire incident, from every aspect. I hope to confirm that person in coming days.\n\n\u201cThe loss of the lives of three people, two in South Australia and one in Western Australia, is absolutely tragic. I would again like to extend my deepest condolences to their families and friends.\u201d\n\nThe SA police commissioner, Grant Stevens, told the premier on Friday night that Optus had only supplied the suburbs where the deaths had occurred.\n\n\u201cI then called the CEO of Optus and thankfully, it was rectified following that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut the lack of information flow from Optus to the South Australian government\u2019s appropriate authorities is somewhat bewildering, and it raises a lot of questions.\u201d\n\nThe federal communications minister, Anika Wells, said the incident was \u201cincredibly serious and completely unacceptable\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe impact of this failure has had tragic consequences, and my personal thoughts are with those who have lost a loved one,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nIn a press conference on Saturday, Wells said Australians had \u201cevery right to be livid that Optus cannot get these basics right\u201d.\n\n\u201cOptus have let Australians down when they needed them most.\u201d\n\nAll telecommunications providers were obliged to ensure they carried emergency service calls, and the outage would be thoroughly investigated, Wells said, adding that the government would wait until state authorities and communications regulatory bodies had completed their investigations before considering possible consequences for Optus.\n\nThe federal opposition\u2019s communications spokesperson, Melissa McIntosh, expressed deep concern the triple zero camp-on arrangements to divert calls to other carriers like Telstra or Vodafone had also failed.\n\nThe outage occurred almost two years after more than 10 million Optus customers and businesses were disconnected for more than 16 hours in November 2023.\n\nPeople could not call triple zero on landlines, although it was still possible on a mobile.\n\nThe telco was fined more than $12m for breaching emergency call rules during the nationwide outage.\n\nRue took over as the company\u2019s chief executive in 2024 from Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, who resigned over the 2023 outage."

He died on Friday in Glasgow\u2019s Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice, his DJ partner Jonnie Wilkes (AKA JG Wilkes) announced.\n\n\u201cIn a 28 year partnership he changed my life immeasurably and together we took our work in directions and to places few people are lucky enough to explore,\u201d Wilkes said. \u201cI am forever grateful for everything he bestowed on me, both as a partner in music and as a friend.\u201d\n\nMcIvor grew up in Edinburgh in a family who \u201chad the most middle of the road, blandest music taste imaginable\u201d, he later said, but after moving to Glasgow to go to university in 1986 he became involved in club culture across both cities.\n\nHe began DJing electro and EBM (electronic body music) at a club night in Edinburgh, graduating to house and techno as those styles reached the UK and the acid house era began. The night was shut down by police after a brawl between football hooligans, but McIvor began a new night called Pure with the blessing of the authorities by making it a members only event. \u201cIt gave us the chance to start again from scratch and do a club 100% on our own terms,\u201d he said. \u201cOut went anything to do with all the awful Madchester-related music and in came a completely different crowd.\u201d\n\nPure became a core event in the Scottish house and techno scene, but McIvor \u2013 who grew to find DJ culture \u201call pretty boring\u201d \u2013 began another event in 1997 that gave voice to the breadth of his catholic taste. Taking its name from the track Optimo by New York punk-funk band Liquid Liquid \u2013 which McIvor would go on to remix \u2013 the Sunday night event at Glasgow\u2019s Sub Club alongside DJ partner JG Wilkes (Jonnie Wilkes) ran every week until 2010.\n\nMcIvor said the pair were not \u201caligned to any one particular musical movement\u201d \u2013 championing electroclash, punk, new wave, soft rock and a range of other styles alongside dance tracks, and hosting bands such as LCD Soundsystem and TV On the Radio as well as guest DJs. Optimo pre-empted the open-mindedness of the internet age, and became lauded as one of the most significant events in global dance culture. Thereafter McIvor and Wilkes continued to DJ internationally under the Optimo name.\n\nMcIvor was also a producer, and as Optimo\u2019s star rose he was sought after as a remixer for the likes of Franz Ferdinand, R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy, Manic Street Preachers, Florence + the Machine and more (\u201cDiscogs tells me I did 108 remixes, though it\u2019s probably a few more,\u201d he said in 2023). McIvor also founded the label Optimo Music (plus spin-offs such as the Brazil-focused Selva Discos), and Optimo created acclaimed compilation albums such as How to Kill the DJ (Part Two). McIvor also curated the soundtrack to Beats, a 2019 film set in the 90s rave scene in Scotland, and put out music under the alias Tomorrow the Rain Will Fall Upwards.\n\nMcIvor announced his illness in July 2025, saying: \u201cMy symptoms weren\u2019t immediately diagnosed, and my health declined very rapidly over just a few weeks \u2026 I am currently trying to process this news and prioritising spending precious time with the people I love.\u201d\n\nWilkes added in his tribute to McIvor: \u201cI am forever grateful for everything he bestowed on me, both as a partner in music and as a friend. Keith\u2019s intensity and passion for life, for music, for creativity and for positive change simply never let up. He was formidable. His belief in people and the idea that standing together, that our collective strength is powerful was unwavering. I loved him for that.\u201d\n\nAfter thanking hospice staff and others, he added: \u201cKeith left us far too soon. He will go now to travel those space-ways but I know his energy remains in every one of us who had the privilege of knowing him. I love you forever Keith."

It was in response to a bubbling discussion in Australia about whether a different major conservative party could emerge outside the established Liberal or National ones.\n\nReferencing Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform party in the UK, leading in polls over the traditional conservatives, Abbott said: \u201cI don\u2019t say that something like that should never, ever happen here in Australia. But what we need right now in Australia is not a reform party, but a reformed party. A reformed Liberal party.\u201d\n\nAudience members at several points interjected during Abbott\u2019s speech, yelling support for Pauline Hanson and One Nation. Hanson will speak at the conference on Sunday, while conservative politicians Alex Antic, Matt Canavan and former British prime minister Liz Truss were among Saturday\u2019s speakers.\n\nCoalition sources remained concerned about losing support on their left and right to more moderate \u201cteal\u201d or independent MPs as well as to more right-wing parties like One Nation. A recent Newspoll showed the Coalition\u2019s primary vote at its lowest-ever ebb, just 27%, while One Nation had risen to 10%.\n\nChanges to the Coalition were a common theme for speakers. Price asked attendees to help in \u201cshaping\u201d the Liberal party, which she said must be \u201csmarter\u201d and \u201csharper\u201d. She branded May\u2019s election defeat as \u201ca Coalition failure\u201d, having \u201clost our nerve to prosecute policies of difference from Labor\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need to return to being a strong centre-right party \u2013 in conviction, in policy, and in practice,\u201d she said.\n\nPrice again urged Liberal colleagues to dump the net zero by 2050 target agreed by former PM Scott Morrison. She branded the climate target \u201ccommunism\u201d, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s time the Liberals pushed back against this freedom-eroding nonsense.\u201d\n\nAbbott also urged Liberals to strongly oppose Labor\u2019s climate action, claiming this week\u2019s announcement of a 62-70% by 2035 reduction target \u201ccould be this government\u2019s political death warrant\u201d.\n\nThe opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said she doesn\u2019t support setting climate targets in opposition, but that the Coalition was still reviewing its net zero position, and remained committed it.\n\nWarren Mundine, the chair of Cpac who has run for Liberal pre-selection after serving as Labor party president, said conservative voters needed to cooperate to win future elections.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a battle; we get the conservative side of politics back together, and this is the beginning of it. We need to bring all the conservative groups together. One thing in the lesson that we\u2019ve learned from the left is: how do we do preferences and support each other?\u201d he said.\n\nMundine asked Cpac attendees to listen to the \u201cbrave Liberal and National party people\u201d who would speak at the conference, saying \u201cthey\u2019re going to be our champions\u201d.\n\nDeputy Liberal leader Ted O\u2019Brien, who along with Ley was supported by the party\u2019s moderate wing to win a leadership ballot after Peter Dutton\u2019s election defeat, was heckled by some attendees during his address. As he called Albanese\u2019s government \u201cthe worst since Whitlam\u201d, several audience members loudly interjected with \u201cwhat are you going to do about it?\u201d and \u201cit starts with you\u201d.\n\nO\u2019Brien also admitted the need \u201cto rebuild the Liberal party\u201d.\n\nNationals senator Bridget McKenzie, the shadow transport minister, said the \u201ccentre-right of politics \u2026 has to stop fighting amongst ourselves\u201d.\n\n\u201cBecause how the enemy has done this to us; [they are] highly disciplined, very well-financed, and relentless, militant in their intent over time. We tend to just bag each other out.\u201d"

And in a way, I can focus more about what I'm passionate on, and be a voice for that, rather than being bogged down with a lot of other stuff.\"\n\nHe's worked on a lot of those issues that he cares about over his 20-plus years in Congress, as well.\n\n\"It's been an honor of a lifetime \u2013 chairing Homeland Security during one of the most dangerous times with the rise of the ISIS caliphate and all the external operations that we want to stop, establishing the cybersecurity agency. I did TSA PreCheck and Global Entry \u2013 those were fun things to work on. But then, as the chairman of Foreign Affairs, working on very big foreign policy issues like the fall of Afghanistan,\" McCaul said.\n\n\"Everything I've done with Ukraine after [Russian President Vladimir Putin] invaded \u2013 that emergency wartime supplemental bill was probably the highlight, because had we not passed that, I think Russia would be occupying Ukraine today, and they'd be in Moldova and Georgia and maybe threatening the Baltic States and Poland.\"\n\nThe senior lawmaker has been a leading voice on foreign policy in a Republican Party that's seen a growing isolationist streak \u2013 something McCaul said concerned him.\n\n\"I think it's a very dangerous mentality. It didn't work in 1939, and there are a lot of parallels to 1939 today. Now, I think burden sharing, that's real. I think, you know, having NATO standing up \u2013 I think [President Donald Trump] is right about that. I think he wants other NATO countries to do secondary sanctions, and it should be a team effort,\" he said.\n\n\"But I think there are certain people in the administration that are very much \u2013 the America First I agree with, but it's not at the expense of abdicating our responsibility to lead the world. And I think that's dangerous if that's what they think America First is all about.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAsked if he had any regrets over his time in Congress, McCaul said he was proud of his work on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"There was a time when, you know, there was a Senate possibility, but I wouldn't trade what I have done for anything,\" he said. \"I feel very at peace with this, because I feel like I'm going out on top. I've chaired two major committees. I\u2019ve been effective. There's a good expression \u2013 I\u2019ll miss the clowns, but I won't miss the circus.\""

If she fails to do so at the budget she will have serious questions to answer over whether events like this one influenced her at all.\n\n\u201cTo show she cares about taxpayers more than big gambling firms the chancellor should commit to raising taxes on online gambling giants ahead of the budget.\u201d\n\nBrunswick said Dugher\u2019s role in the gambling industry was \u201ccompletely separate\u201d from his work for the public relations firm.\n\nThe debate over whether to raise taxes on gambling puts Dugher at the centre of a tug of war between leading Labour figures with whom he has longstanding ties.\n\nDugher was formerly a special adviser to Brown, who has called for taxes on online gambling to rise by as much as \u00a33bn to help fund an end to the two-child benefit cap.\n\nBut Dugher also has a longstanding relationship with Reeves, with whom he claimed to have been \u201cin touch\u201d earlier this year during the BGC\u2019s tax campaign, which included hosting a darts-themed event with the Paddy Power owner, Flutter.\n\nReeves said at the time that she had no formal meeting with the BGC and would not ever have discussed the tax changes.\n\nThe pair\u2019s friendship stretches back to their teenage years, while they also once shared a parliamentary office in Westminster.\n\nThey will reunite for the Brunswick event on 28 September, weeks before Reeves announces her second budget as chancellor, at which any new taxes on online casinos could be revealed.\n\n\u201cVery strange timing for such an event,\u201d said Tom Brake, a former Liberal Democrat MP and director of Unlock Democracy, a campaign group that advocates for improved parliamentary standards.\n\nHe said Reeves \u201cshould have politely declined\u201d the invitation, adding that her acceptance was the sort of thing that could be considered by a new standards body, the ethics and integrity commission, due to be established next month.\n\nA spokesperson for Brunswick said: \u201cFor many years Brunswick has hosted a reception at the Labour party conference which enables senior business leaders to engage with a number of ministers and MPs.\n\n\u201cMichael is a part-time senior adviser to Brunswick, and his work with us is completely separate from his other roles. He will be hosting the event jointly alongside partners from Brunswick\u2019s public affairs team.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian approached the chancellor for comment."

                "text": "Australia\u2019s big miners are not averse to a political fight.\n\nConsider the biggest miner of them all: BHP.\n\nIn 2010, it fought fiercely against the super profits tax and helped bring down a prime minister. In 2017, a state party leader who championed an increase in mine lease fees in Western Australia lost his seat after a campaign by BHP.\n\nAnd since 2022, the big miner has railed against Queensland\u2019s revamped royalty scheme, brought in by Labor and now supported by the Liberal National government.\n\nOn Wednesday, BHP escalated its campaign by blaming \u201cunsustainable\u201d royalties and market conditions for its decision with its joint venture partner, Mitsubishi, to suspend operations at its Saraji South coalmine in the Bowen Basin, and slash 750 roles across the state.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nThe big miner said it will also conduct a strategic review of the BHP FutureFit Academy in Mackay \u2013 an educational facility that trains new miners \u2013 because of the royalty scheme\u2019s \u201cunsustainable impact on our business returns\u201d.\n\nShortly after the announcement, two other miners operating in Queensland, Anglo American and QCoal, revealed job cuts.\n\nRoyalties alone don\u2019t explain the decisions.\n\nDig deeper\n\nThe BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) operates five coking coalmines in Queensland\u2019s Bowen Basin, most of which are open-cut operations. Coking coal, also known as metallurgical or met coal, differs from thermal coal used in heating \u2013 a business that BHP has been exiting.\n\nThere\u2019s some pretty obvious reasons coalmines across Queensland aren\u2019t as profitable as they used to be, most of which have nothing to do with the state\u2019s tiered royalty rates.\n\nProduction costs have been rising as miners dig deeper into the earth. This takes more fuel, and causes expensive wear and tear on equipment, to get at it.\n\nAt the same time, worker wages and associated labour costs have risen in a sector that regularly experiences skills shortages.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a cost problem \u2013 and royalties are one of those elements \u2013 but they\u2019re certainly not the main element,\u201d says Andrew Gorringe, energy financial analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve also been focused on getting volume at any cost. When the prices were good and they wanted to sell as much coal as they could, they expanded with little thought to costs.\u201d\n\nCoalminers recently emerged from a windfall period, marked by huge price rises after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Coking coal prices soared above $US600 a tonne in 2022, but have since normalised at under $US200.\n\nIn 2022, as prices were soaring, the then Labor government introduced three new royalty tiers to capture a greater share of wealth generated during commodity price spikes. The base rates, when prices are lower, remain the same.\n\nThe scheme agitates miners because it reduces, but in no way eliminates, the excesses they can earn during boom times, setting up an ideological clash between the resources sector and those who believe mineral wealth should be apportioned more evenly.\n\nGorringe says unit cash costs, which are a key profitability metric, for Queensland\u2019s coking coal producers have risen 50% since 2018.\n\nRoyalties actually represent a lower percentage of their cost base in 2025 than they did before the pandemic, according to his analysis.\n\nCoal \u2018tax\u2019\n\nThe ideological divide is evident in BHP\u2019s description of royalties as the Queensland government\u2019s \u201ccoal tax\u201d, a politically charged term designed to stir up support for the resources sector in the community.\n\nIn Australia, state governments own the minerals in the ground. Miners pay a royalty to access them; they are not a tax.\n\nIt would be the ultimate mark of a successful lobbying campaign if the resources sector convinces the general public miners should pay a lower rate for a publicly owned resource.\n\nThe idea that the state purse might receive a higher rate when prices surge is particularly sensitive for coalminers because they are in a sector that may not have many booms left.\n\n\u201cStructural decline in one of Australia\u2019s largest fossil fuel export commodities coupled with rising unit costs are the factors driving these investment and operating decisions, not Queensland\u2019s nation-leading royalty scheme,\u201d says Matt Pollard, an analyst at clean energy consultancy Climate Energy Finance.\n\nWhile the role of coking coal in steelmaking will eventually be supplanted by cleaner alternatives, BHP argues that it is \u201cconsidered indispensable for the foreseeable future\u201d.\n\nAfter commodity price booms subside, miners typically shed some jobs and re-focus on bringing down production costs, which is evident in the series of recent announcements from coalminers of workforce changes.\n\nSome projects may simply not be viable outside boom times.\n\nTo be sure, Queensland\u2019s royalty regime is a cost that miners must factor in to their anticipated workforce needs, but it is not the primary trigger for job cuts in a sector that appears to be in decline.\n\nBHP\u2019s decision to link the royalty scheme to its \u201cstrategic review\u201d of its Mackay training facility has a particular sting to it, given it looks like an ultimatum to bring the state government to the negotiating table.\n\nBHP has, once again, shown it\u2019s not averse to a political fight."

                "text": "The average reading and math scores of American high school seniors fell to their lowest levels in two decades in 2024, according to new national data released last week.\n\nThe results, from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), found that, on average, reading scores for 12th graders were 10 points lower in 2024 than they were in 1992, when the test was first administered, and that math scores fell to their lowest levels since 2005, when the math assessment began.\n\nThe test, administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which is part of the US Department of Education, assessed roughly 19,300 12th-graders in math, 24,300 in reading and 23,000 eighth-graders in science between January and March of last year.\n\nThe report found that 35% of seniors \u201cperformed at or above\u201d the NAEP\u2019s \u201cproficient\u201d level in reading, and 22% were at or above that level in math.\n\nIt also stated that 45% of 12th graders scored below the NAEP\u2019s \u201cbasic\u201d level in math, marking a five percentage-point increase from 2019. In reading, 32% of students scored below the basic level, which was a two-point increase from 2019.\n\n\u201cThese results are sobering,\u201d said NCES acting commissioner Matthew Soldner. \u201cThe drop in overall scores coincides with significant declines in achievement among our lowest-performing students, continuing a downward trend that began before the Covid pandemic.\n\n\u201cAmong our nation\u2019s high-school seniors, we\u2019re now seeing a larger percentage of students scoring below the NAEP basic achievement level in mathematics and reading than in any previous assessment.\u201d\n\nOne lingering effect of the pandemic present in the report was chronic absenteeism. The report found that about a third of 12th-graders reported missing three or more days of school in the month before the test, up from 25% in 2019.\n\n\u201cStudents are spending less time learning,\u201d said Thomas Kane, an education economist at Harvard. \u201cAnd when they are present, instruction is less efficient because teachers are constantly reteaching material.\u201d\n\nRobert Balfanz, a professor at John Hopkins University School of Education, said easy access to information online and the use of online assignments may also be leading some students to treat in-person school attendance as optional.\n\n\u201cIn their minds, they tell their parents, \u2018Look, all my assignments are online, I can do them even if I\u2019m not at school,\u2019\u201d Balfanz said.\n\nBut while the Covid pandemic and school closures had major effects on learning, experts say the academic decline began before 2020.\n\n\u201cThe uncomfortable truth is that American students have been significantly losing ground for more than a decade,\u201d Eric Hanushek, an education economist, wrote in an opinion piece last week. \u201cThe pandemic didn\u2019t break American education \u2013 it was already broken.\u201d\n\nKane said the decline among lower-achieving students began some time around 2015 and has continued.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly not just the pandemic,\u201d Kane said. \u201cIt should be troubling to everyone, and we need to find a solution.\u201d\n\nExperts point to a range of potential factors beyond absenteeism that could be contributing to the decline, including increased screen time and smartphone use, declining student engagement, and the rollback of test-based accountability since the expiration of the No Child Left Behind Act in 2015.\n\nCarol Jago, a longtime English teacher and literacy expert at UCLA, told the Associated Press last week that students today read fewer books and spend less time with longer texts.\n\n\u201cTo be a good reader, you have to have the stamina to stay on the page, even when the going gets tough,\u201d Jago said. \u201cYou have to build those muscles, and we\u2019re not building those muscles in kids.\u201d\n\nBalfanz added that the constant exposure to short-form and visual media in students\u2019 daily lives may be making academic focus more difficult.\n\nOne potential solution, he said, could be to add more dedicated reading time into school days \u2013 and restricting smartphones in classrooms.\n\nKane noted that academic declines are appearing in other countries as well, which suggests a broader global trend that could be linked to increased screen use.\n\nSome US states have already passed laws restricting phone use in schools. Kane believes that there needs to be a national effort to assess the impact and effectiveness of those policies to see whether they work and ought to be implemented in more areas.\n\nThe role of smart phones and social media in academic performance came up this week during a Senate hearing on the NAEP results.\n\nMartin West, the vice-chair of the National Assessment Governing Board, which oversees policy for the NAEP, told lawmakers that the rise of \u201csmartphones and social media platforms targeting youth\u201d is one area they should investigate.\n\n\u201cWe lack direct evidence of a causal link between smartphones and learning, but I\u2019m convinced that this technology is a key driver of youth mental health challenges, a distraction from learning, both inside and outside of schools, and a deterrent to reading,\u201d West said.\n\nRebecca Winthrop, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, testified that student disengagement was exacerbated by the pandemic and is being amplified by social media. She endorsed actions such as smart phone bans, higher academic expectations, and adopting more engaging teaching styles.\n\nThe NAEP results also reignited the debate around the federal government\u2019s role in education, with US education secretary Linda McMahon saying last week that the lesson from the results \u201cis clear\u201d.\n\n\u201cSuccess isn\u2019t about how much money we spend, but who controls the money and where that money is invested,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why President Trump and I are committed to returning control of education to the states so they can innovate and meet each school and students\u2019 unique needs.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Tim Walberg, a Republican who chairs the House education committee, agreed and said that \u201cby returning education to the states, we can empower parents and local communities and ensure every child gains the skills necessary to succeed\u201d.\n\nBut Democratic representative Bobby Scott pushed back, writing that the NAEP results \u201creinforce the urgent need for sustained federal investment in academic recovery and educational equity\u201d.\n\n\u201cNow is not the time to retreat from our responsibility to provide every child, regardless of zip code, with the opportunity to succeed,\u201d he added.\n\nBalfanz believes that \u201csome collective effort at the national level\u201d is needed to support states and districts in implementing proven solutions. He emphasized the need to \u201cset targets and goals and strategies\u201d and help build the capacity at the local level to be able to achieve them.\n\nKane said that he agrees that states need to take a \u201cmore aggressive role in helping to reverse these trends\u201d but that the federal government also needs to prioritize partnering with states \u201cin a concerted, coordinated effort to answer two questions: finding effective ways to lower absenteeism and measuring the impact of the cellphone bans\u201d.\n\n\u201cSomething fundamental in US schools is broken,\u201d Kane warned. \u201cAnd we need to fix it.\u201d"

The boy\u2019s father was separated from his son as they were both swept away by the water, and the father was later rescued, according to officials. The boy\u2019s body was found Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, near the San Bernardino national forest, authorities rescued 10 people traveling in at least six vehicles who were stranded on state route 38 in the area of Jenks Lake, the local fire district said. The route is narrow and winds through towering trees, curving back and forth up the mountainside and linking cities east of Los Angeles with the resort town of Big Bear Lake.\n\nChristopher Prater, a public information officer for the San Bernardino county fire protection district, said no one was hurt in the area of Jenks Lake, and no one is reported missing.\n\nThe mudslides affected the tiny mountain communities of Forest Falls, Oak Glen and Potato Canyon, the county\u2019s fire protection district said in a statement. One home in Forest Falls had giant tree trunks flung in its yard and piled so high they reached the roof.\n\nForest Falls was walloped by mudslides three years ago. That was just two years after wildfires ripped through the area, leaving burn scars, or areas where there is little vegetation to hold the soil.\n\nIntense rains pounded the area for more than an hour Thursday afternoon as remnants of Tropical Storm Mario reached the mountainous region, the US\u2019s National Weather Service (NWS) said.\n\nKael Steel told KNBC-TV he was driving down the mountain from Big Bear to head to an amusement park when the rain started pounding.\n\n\u201cSuddenly we started seeing rocks and stuff coming down the side of the mountain,\u201d he said.\n\nSteel said cars were turning around telling him the road was blocked.

By Friday evening, the evacuation warning had been lifted, the San Bernardino county sheriff\u2019s office said in a post on X.\n\nForest Falls saw 1.5in (3.8cm) of rainfall in an hour, and another half inch (1.3cm) after that \u2013 far more than the arid southern California region usually sees, said Kyle Wheeler, a meteorologist for the NWS in San Diego.\n\nThe rain also fell much faster, Wheeler said, adding that the rainfall rates for summer thunderstorms in the region are more typically about a half inch (1.3cm) per hour.\n\n\u201cThey got almost two inches of rain in a two-hour time period,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThe fact that it happened in such a flood-prone location is just an unfortunate event.\u201d"

In both venues, Patel advocated for the agency\u2019s priorities.\n\nBut his 10 total hours of testimony were also marked by intense and hostile exchanges with Democrats, often related to the Epstein investigation. And his appearance Wednesday was interrupted by Democrats moving to subpoena four major banks in an effort to obtain Epstein\u2019s financial records \u2014 a motion that failed by a single vote.\n\nOver the two days, Patel openly feuded with Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Adam Schiff, as well as Rep. Eric Swalwell; he appeared to relish the verbal sparring, which the White House\u2019s rapid response feed quickly amplified. In one heated exchange with Swalwell, Patel said he would not recuse himself from any investigations into 60 people he once labeled \u201cgovernment gangsters\u201d \u2014 including Swalwell.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what they say about me,\u201d Patel said when Rep. Russell Fry (R-S.C.) asked him to respond to a Democratic fusillade.\n\nOn Epstein, Patel insisted the FBI is releasing as many files as possible but is hamstrung by court orders and a nearly 20-year-old deal struck between the Justice Department and Epstein that have impeded crucial avenues of investigation. He repeatedly noted that the Trump administration had released more Epstein-related files than its predecessors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to break the law to satisfy your curiosity,\u201d Patel told Democrats, who in turn countered that the FBI director is misrepresenting his own power to publicly produce new materials judges have said is in the purview of the FBI and Justice Department.\n\nPatel heard from Republicans on the Epstein issue, too. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) joined Democrats in pressing Patel to release witness interview summaries during the House Judiciary hearing Wednesday. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Tuesday the FBI needs to move to release Epstein-related records.\n\n\u201cThe issue\u2019s not gonna go away,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cI think you\u2019re gonna have to do more to satisfy the American people\u2019s understandable curiosity in that regard.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats proved that point Wednesday, when they forced votes on issuing subpoenas for four banks that did business with Epstein and subsequently told regulators about $1.5 billion in suspicious transactions, as well as for the purposes of obtaining testimony from FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and records from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Bureau of Prisons Director William Marshall.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the only Republican to support Democrats in their attempts, which were squelched by Republicans. But failure Wednesday was not a foregone conclusion: In a House Oversight subcommittee in July, some Republicans helped push through Democratic subpoena efforts related to the Epstein files, which has resulted in the release of materials in the Justice Department\u2019s possession.\n\nMassie is also not giving up on a separate attempt to force a House floor vote on the more comprehensive release of the Epstein files, and only needs one more signatory to proceed.\n\nThe issue has put all of Trump\u2019s allies in an uncomfortable position, caught between their promises of transparency and realities of operating the country\u2019s sprawling law enforcement agencies. Patel is no exception.\n\n\u201cIs it your assertion that these victims aren\u2019t credible?\u201d Massie asked Patel Wednesday. \u201cHow can you sit here and in front of the Senate and say there are no names?\u201d\n\nDemocrats also pressed Patel over and over again to explain his own personal reversal on the issue, as well as the bureau\u2019s ongoing efforts to both disclose Epstein-related documents and continue to investigate his sex trafficking ring.\n\nPressed by Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-N.Y.), Patel said he would consider opening an investigation into the Epstein estate over Trump\u2019s claim that a suggestive letter in Epstein\u2019s 50th-birthday book was forged.\n\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Patel said."

In a new A&E docuseries, he reflects on the changing landscape of adult content, stating that the business model for sex tapes is effectively over, as celebrities can now directly share their content without fear of leaks. Blatt also emphasizes his current role in helping individuals remove non-consensual content from the internet, contrasting his past with a desire to support others in safeguarding their privacy.",

                "text": "OnlyFans has killed Kevin Blatt\u2019s career.\n\nThe celebrity sex tape broker, who infamously promoted the intimate recordings of Paris Hilton in the early 2000s, believes the subscription-based platform makes it easier for celebrities to sleep at night without fear of leaks.\n\n\"There just isn\u2019t that potential to make any money, not the way that we used to,\" Blatt told Fox News Digital. \"It\u2019s a different day and age now. The technology\u2019s changed it all. With sites like OnlyFans, you could put up your own content. \u2026 Now you put out a sex tape just to become a blip on the radar for TMZ or the national news to talk about.\"\n\nCHARLIE SHEEN OPENS UP ABOUT SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS WITH MEN FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nBlatt is speaking out in a new A&E docuseries, \"Secrets of Celebrity Sex Tapes.\" The show offers an in-depth look at how racy footage ignited public obsession, sparked outrage and impacted the lives of those involved. It features the stories of celebrities like Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, as well as Kim Kardashian, Colin Farrell and Farrah Abraham, among others.\n\nBlatt admitted he hesitated to come forward about his adult entertainment past.\n\n\"I\u2019m very cautious of the media because you never know how they\u2019re going to portray you,\" said Blatt.\n\n\"But look, sex tapes, as we know them, are over. The business model\u2019s over. There\u2019s no way of profiting from them anymore unless people contact me to take them off the market. That\u2019s what I do a lot these days \u2014 help people take down videos and information off the internet. But the bottom line is you can\u2019t make money because of the privacy laws that are in place and the platforms that are readily accessible.\"\n\n\"I think the public is smart enough to know that a lot of these celebrities are promoting themselves or using platforms like OnlyFans to attract more attention,\" he added.\n\nOver the years, OnlyFans has become known as a place where sex workers can get paid more safely and stars can directly interact with fans on their terms.\n\nWATCH: DONNA D\u2019ERRICO CLEARS UP BIGGEST ONLYFANS MISCONCEPTION\n\nMany sex workers joined OnlyFans during the pandemic when in-person venues shut down or became more dangerous because of COVID-19, the Associated Press reported. According to the outlet, the site has been tremendously lucrative for some people, allowing them to earn thousands of dollars each month.\n\nAs of late 2024, OnlyFans reported having about 377.5 million user and subscriber accounts, according to Business Insider. The outlet also reported that creators of the platform earned $6.63 billion in 2023.\n\n\"Sex tapes? Those days are over,\" Blatt stressed. \"\u2026 Some people don\u2019t realize you can\u2019t really profit from them. \u2026 Many folks benefit from putting themselves up on a site like OnlyFans instead of having to market through an adult company.\"\n\n\"\u2026 The future of the business is really you being able to be your own network and syndicate your own stuff via any platform where you can submit user-generated content,\" he added.\n\nIn 2021, OnlyFans announced it had suspended a plan to ban sexually explicit content following an outcry from its creators.\n\nAdvocates for sex workers had criticized the planned ban, arguing that it would push people into more dangerous street-based work. They said taking away a safer virtual space and cutting people\u2019s income makes them more vulnerable to the risk of being trafficked, the Associated Press reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nBlatt claimed that celebrities now shouldn\u2019t worry about a sex tape being sold.\n\n\"As you\u2019ll see in the docuseries, I talk about the legalities of it \u2026 But honestly, should they be worried? No.\"\n\nBut the damage from past leaks has been lasting. In her 2023 memoir, Hilton shed new light on her 2003 tape with then-boyfriend Rick Salomon.\n\n\"I don't remember that much about the night he wanted to make a videotape while we made love,\" wrote the hotel heiress, as quoted by The Times of London. \"He had often said it was something he did with other women, but I felt weird and uncomfortable about it. I always told him, \u2018I can\u2019t. It\u2019s too embarrassing.\u2019 He kept pushing. I kept making excuses.\"\n\n\"He told me if I wouldn't do it, he could easily find someone who would,\" the mom of two wrote. \"That was the worst thing I could think of \u2014 to be dumped by this grown man because I was a stupid kid who didn't know how to play grown-up games.\"\n\n\"\u2026 I had to drink myself silly. Quaaludes helped. But I did it. I have to own that. I knew what he wanted, and I went with it.\"\n\nWhat should have been a private moment between two people was released to the public. As Hilton struggled with her sexuality, the footage spread quickly. Looking back, the now-44-year-old believed that her life \"was over\" and the career she envisioned for herself wasn\u2019t possible. She felt violated.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\n\"The world thinks of me as a sex symbol, and I'm here for that, because symbol literally means icon,\" she wrote. \"But when people saw that sex tape, they didn't say 'icon,' they said 'slut.' They said 'whore.'\"\n\nWhen asked if there was ever a point in his career where he felt that he had gone too far, Blatt responded that since then, \"I've turned my skillset from putting things out to taking things off the market.\"\n\n\"I had an epiphany at one point,\" he said. \"Not only were a lot of these people thrown into a situation they didn\u2019t ask for, but [now], I like to help people out. There was never a point where I thought what I was doing was horrible or going to ruin somebody\u2019s life.\n\n\"And to be honest with you \u2026 I don\u2019t believe that any of these sex tapes have really harmed anybody\u2019s career. They\u2019ve only enhanced people\u2019s careers and put them back in the zeitgeist. There have been a lot of people who got shows, cameos and movies as a result of becoming popular on TMZ because of the sex tape. \u2026 Some people think I\u2019m an extortionist. But people don\u2019t realize that some of these celebrities were willing participants in the marketing of their sex tapes.\"\n\n\"\u2026 There\u2019s a general misconception that I\u2019m this bad guy,\" he continued. \"I\u2019m really anything but a bad guy. \u2026 I\u2019m just a nice Jewish boy from Cleveland.\"\n\nLife for Blatt these days is scandal-free, just as he prefers it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I\u2019m not stressing out,\" he said. \"I\u2019m not looking over my shoulder to see who\u2019s going to be suing me or if someone is going to come after me \u2026 I know the laws. I know how it all works. Back in the day, when I used to get sued every other week by some A-list celebrity power lawyer, I was running and hiding. I thought I was going to go to jail. \u2026 Now, my life is good. \u2026 I\u2019ve become a different person.\""

(See the video at the top of the article.)\n\nFITNESS EXPERT REVEALS 6 PILLARS OF STRENGTH TRAINING THAT OLDER ADULTS SHOULD MASTER\n\n\"Most people train what they see in the mirror \u2014 chest, arms, quads and maybe abs if they\u2019re feeling ambitious,\" Suazo told Fox News Digital. \"That\u2019s what I call \u2018mirror training.\u2019\"\n\nThe problem with focusing only on \"mirror training,\" he said, is that you\u2019ll end up out of balance, with rounded shoulders, a tight chest and eventually a sore back or knees.\n\n\"If you want to age strong, pain-free and confident, you need to flip the script,\" Suazo said. \"You need non-mirror training \u2014 training the muscles you can\u2019t see but feel every single day. These are the muscles that keep you standing tall, moving with power and living without pain.\"\n\nSuazo learned firsthand about the benefits of this training when he was swimming competitively and training in martial arts.\n\nWANT BETTER HEART HEALTH? START BY TACKLING YOUR WEAKEST LINK, CARDIAC SURGEON SAYS\n\n\"I learned that the muscles behind me were what made me faster in the pool, quicker on my feet and harder to knock off balance,\" he said. \"Strengthening the back side of your body changes everything.\"\n\nBelow are some of the most critical muscles for older adults to focus on, according to the trainer.\n\nPower zone: Glutes and hamstrings\n\nThese muscles are the foundation of non-mirror training, according to Suazo.\n\n\"Your glutes and hamstrings give you the power to sit, stand, climb and protect your back from pain,\" he said.\n\nTo target these areas, Suazo recommends doing deadlifts, hip thrusts and single leg bridges. \"Take your time, control the movement and squeeze at the top,\" he advised. \"This is where the real work happens.\"\n\nPosture zone: Upper- and mid-back\n\nStrengthening these muscles will keep you from looking hunched or slouched as you age, according to Suazo.\n\nVIRAL 12-3-30 TREADMILL TREND MAY BURN MORE FAT THAN RUNNING, RESEARCHERS SAY\n\n\"A strong back pulls your shoulders into alignment and lets you breathe better,\" he said.\n\nBent-over rows, cable rows and bodyweight rows are some of the trainer\u2019s favorite moves for this zone. \"Pull through the elbows and picture yourself standing taller with every rep,\" he suggested.\n\nStability zone: Core and obliques\n\n\"Your core is more than what you see in the mirror,\" Suazo said. \"True core training is about stability and spine protection.\"\n\nHis favorite move for stability is the Paloff press. \"Anchor a band, press it straight out and resist rotation,\" he instructed. \"Do it standing or kneeling. This is how you teach your body to brace and protect your back during everyday life.\"\n\nTWO KEY HEART HEALTH METRICS COULD DETERMINE HOW LONG YOU'LL LIVE\n\nMobility zone: Shoulders and rotator cuff\n\n\"Healthy shoulders are a must if you want to keep training for decades,\" Suazo said. \"They\u2019re involved in almost every movement, so you need them strong and mobile.\"\n\nFor this area, the trainer recommends face pulls, rear delt flies, light band rotations and controlled overhead presses. \"This combination keeps your shoulders feeling good and moving well,\" he said.\n\nGrip zone: Hands and forearms\n\n\"Grip strength is one of the first things people lose with age, and it\u2019s one of the most important \u2014 a strong grip keeps you independent,\" Suazo said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFarmer\u2019s carries are his go-to for improving grip strength. Suazo recommends aiming to carry 70% of your body weight in each hand.\n\n\"Pick up weights, stand tall and walk with intention,\" he suggested. \"Hanging from a pull-up bar works, too. Build that grip and you\u2019ll notice a difference in every other lift.\"\n\n\"When you train the back side of your body, the front side looks and performs better.\"\n\nBuilding these five muscle groups complements the six core pillars of strength \u2014 push, pull, carry, hinge, overhead press and squat, according to the trainer.\n\n\"Your hinge and carry get more powerful with strong glutes and hamstrings,\" Suazo said. \"Your pulls and presses feel stronger with a stable back and core.

Another woman on Instagram said the loaf is rolled around in melted butter to get the coating to stick.\n\n\"That Butter Cinnamon Sugar Loaf has me drooling!\"\n\nOne serving of the loaf packs 410 calories and 33 grams of sugar, according to Costco's website, but that hasn't stopped fans from raving about it.\n\nOn Reddit, shoppers called it the \"best loaf cake ever to grace my taste buds\" and compared it to \"a Sara Lee pound cake with churro dusting.\"\n\nVIRAL COSTCO COOKIE BLENDS CHILDHOOD FAVORITES INTO ONE: 'OUT OF THIS WORLD'\n\n\"I saw these the other day and intentionally turned away,\" another Reddit user said, adding, \"Kryptonite.\"\n\nCustomers shared similar praise on Instagram and TikTok. \"That Butter Cinnamon Sugar Loaf has me drooling!\" one woman commented on a post from the popular social media account Discovering Costco.\n\n\"That would be gone in no time at my house,\" the woman added.\n\nAnother described it as \"addictive, dangerous and so darn good.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nIn a comment on an Instagram video posted by Costco Hot Finds, someone said the dessert is like a cinnamon cake doughnut.\n\nSome people shared creative hacks for the loaf.\n\n\"These are amazing, and they freeze really well to save one for later,\" one Instagram user said.\n\nLaura Lamb, creator of Costco Hot Finds, suggested making French toast with it. \"It's absolutely incredible,\" Lamb said in the video. \"I've made French toast with this several times, and it's a huge win.\"\n\nMORE FROM FOX NEWS LIFESTYLE\n\nSomeone else recommended putting it in the air fryer for a minute or two.\n\n\"Make it permanent!\" another person urged the big-box retailer.\n\nWhile the loaf's price has fluctuated in the past, it has recently held steady at $9.99, roughly the same price by weight as the three-loaf pack in which it previously came.\n\nCostco loyalists claim it ranks up there with other seasonal cult favorites, including the nearly 4-pound pumpkin cheesecake and the summertime peaches and cream bar cake.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLike those fleeting hits, the Butter Cinnamon Sugar Loaf is inspiring fans to stock up before it disappears again.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Costco for comment."

                "text": "The Army is expanding its use of artificial intelligence beyond drones \u2014 from wearable smart glasses that train mechanics in the field to automated defenses against swarms of cheap enemy aircraft \u2014 as leaders warn the counter-drone fight is now \"problem 1A\" for the nation.\n\nSpeaking to reporters this week, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll described a pilot program in which soldiers wearAI-enabled Ray-Ban glasses that record repair jobs and then use generative models to walk less-experienced troops through infantry squad vehicle maintenance. He said it reflects a new push to bring consumer technology into the force \"a lot more quickly\" than in the past. While Meta may have spent billions developing the glasses, the Army is testing them for about $400 a pair.\n\nGen. Randy George, the Army\u2019s chief of staff, said the same approach applies to the Pentagon\u2019s top emerging challenge: defending against drones.\n\n\"This is problem 1A that we\u2019re facing as a country,\" Driscoll said, stressing that counter-drone technology must be cheap, fast and automated. \"If you think of a drone swarm \u2026 it is a nearly impossible idea for even human beings [to handle].\"\n\nAI ARMS RACE: US AND CHINA WEAPONIZE DRONES, CODE AND BIOTECH FOR THE NEXT GREAT WAR\n\nThat challenge has been underscored overseas, where advanced aircraft have been used to intercept relatively inexpensive drones. \"If you\u2019ve got a $5,000 drone, you want a $2,000 or $3,000 or $4,000 interceptor, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on,\" George said.\n\nLast week, Dutch F-35s and Polish F-16s deployed to take out dozens of Russian drones flying into Russian territory.\n\nGeorge added that the Army is testing proximity rounds and high-energy lasers, while the bigger hurdle is defending against drones in crowded civilian airspace.\n\nAs part of the Army\u2019s \"continuous transformation\" initiative, George said 25 brigades will be overhauled in the next two years to make them more lethal, mobile and survivable in high-threat environments. The first armored brigade combat teams are set to rotate through the National Training Center in California this November, followed by a large-scale exercise in Hawaii.\n\nGeorge also pointed to armor modernization, saying the Army\u2019s next-generation M1E3 tank \u2014 envisioned as a lighter, faster replacement for the Abrams \u2014 could reach units as early as next year. That would mark a major acceleration, since earlier projections suggested the vehicle would not field until the 2030s.\n\nTo pay for its modernization drive, Driscoll said the Army plans to cut $48 billion over five years from programs it no longer needs, reinvesting in drones, air defenses and long-range fires.\n\nPENTAGON UNVEILS $961B BUDGET REQUEST: FUND FOR GOLDEN DOME, MISSILES AND DRONES, FEWER F-35 JETS\n\nThe service also launched a $750 million \"Fuse\" fund to support small and mid-sized businesses and previewed new acquisition reforms to be detailed at next month\u2019s AUSA conference. Modeled partly on the rapid iteration practices of commercial companies, the changes will co-locate soldiers, engineers and contractors to speed up design and fielding.\n\nOfficials also highlighted in-house efforts. George said the Army is now building its own drones at depots with all-American parts \u2014 including models already flying in Ukraine \u2014 to help replenish stockpiles. Driscoll said 3D printing is being tested as a way to overcome the \"tyranny of distance\" in the Indo-Pacific, allowing soldiers to fabricate parts in theater instead of waiting on long supply lines.\n\nGeorge pointed to battlefield command as another area of change. The 4th Infantry Division is now testing command-and-control apps on ruggedized tablets \u2014 replacing the trucks and racks of radios that have long anchored Army command posts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe move is designed to make headquarters smaller and harder to target, though outside experts have warned that relying on commercial-style devices could introduce new cyber vulnerabilities and durability issues in combat.\n\nDriscoll also credited President Trump with backing the Army\u2019s overhaul. \"They\u2019ve held the line every single time when we have made a hard decision,\" he said. Still, he acknowledged that each of the $48 billion in cuts has defenders in Congress and industry."

                "text": "NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nWe're all in desperate need of a feel-good escape, especially after the horrific past couple of weeks our country has endured. Going to the movies used to serve that purpose. They still do, but perhaps the \"feel-good\" part to a lesser extent.\n\nAnd if you want to leapfrog over Halloween, Thanksgiving and everything pumpkin spice and go right into the holiday season, then look no further than IFC's Christmas rom-com, \"The Baltimorons.\"\n\nIt begins on Christmas Eve with lovable loser Cliff Cashen (Michael Strassner), a failed sketch comic and a recovering alcoholic trying to pursue a so-called \"normal\" life. That means finding work as a mortgage broker (if he passes the exam) and settling down with his fianc\u00e9e, Brittany (Olivia Luccardi). Brittany does her very best keeping Cliff on the straight and narrow as he is urged by an old comedy buddy of his to perform at a Christmas Eve show, something Brittany absolutely forbids since comedy and alcohol are completely intertwined for him.\n\nA freak accident involving a loose brick at Brittany's parents' house, however, results in a dental emergency for calamity-prone Cliff. Out of desperation, he drives to the only dentist in Baltimore who answers his call. Coming to the rescue is Didi (Liz Larsen), a no-nonsense workaholic divorcee who's a bit rough around the edges.\n\n\u2018THE CONJURING: LAST RITES\u2019 REVIEW: LAST RODEO, LAST FUMES\n\nCliff slowly chisels away Didi's tough exterior while in the chair between his goofy one-liners and his over-the-top fear of needles. He also showers her with compliments, but she thinks the nitrous oxide is doing the talking.\n\nDespite being an odd pairing, life seems to draw them together. Cliff gets told by Brittany that there's no more food at the dinner table, so he should pick something up (he asks himself why they couldn't just make him a plate \u2014 a good question indeed). And on top of that, his car gets towed. Meanwhile, Didi's Christmas Eve plans are scrapped after her daughter calls to say that dad (Didi's ex) and his much younger girlfriend had tied the knot earlier in the day and were throwing an impromptu reception at their house. So that means Didi will have to wait to see her daughter and granddaughter until Christmas Day. Out of kindness, Didi offers to drive Cliff to the impound lot. And knowing she doesn't have plans because he eavesdropped on her conversation, Cliff insists they get something to eat. Deep down, they both know no one should be alone on Christmas Eve.\n\nAt first, Didi is skeptical. Why does a youngish, bubbly guy like Cliff want to spend time with crotchety grandma like herself? Cliff's good nature ultimately calms her nerves. And over the course of the night, which takes them all over Baltimore, they encourage each other to face their personal obstacles \u2014 from Didi crashing her ex\u2019s party to Cliff giving comedy another shot.\n\n\u2018SPLITSVILLE\u2019 REVIEW: MAKING COMEDIES GREAT AGAIN\n\nAlthough the age dynamic between Cliff and Didi is no Harold and Maude, it may be something the average viewer could struggle to wrap their mind around. Still, Strassner and Larsen's performances and the chemistry between the two make it work.\n\nLarsen starts off as a tiny pit bull with plenty of sass to go around, but eventually her vulnerabilities slip through the cracks. She gives a moving performance, though the film truly belongs to her co-star.\n\nStrassner, who co-wrote the film, shines as the semi-autobiographical Cliff, a teddy bear of a man who balances the battle of his personal demons with his cheesy jokes that finally make Didi smile. He's really as sweet as his candied sweet potatoes he insists Didi try in the car. Strassner's vibrant, innocent sense of humor is something we haven't seen since John Candy.\n\nMACAULAY CULKIN SAYS JOHN CANDY WAS RARE HOLLYWOOD ALLY DURING TROUBLED CHILDHOOD WITH \u2018MONSTER\u2019 FATHER\n\nIt's been more than a decade since writer/director Jay Duplass made anything for the big screen, spending most of that time on various TV projects. \"The Baltimorons\" is like a homecoming of sorts for him. After all, indie comedies are how he and his brother/creative partner Mark Duplass (credited as an executive producer) have made names for themselves. Unlike their earlier films like \"Cyrus\" and \"Jeff, Who Lives at Home,\" \"The Baltimorons\" doesn't feature big-name actors. It benefits from that. Cliff and Didi feel like real people, something that might not have translated if the leads were Seth Rogen and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.\n\nCliff and Didi, total strangers at the start, embark on an emotional adventure that follows the golden rule of improv comedy: \"Yes, and.\" As Cliff explains to Didi during the show, it means going with the moment regardless of where it leads. And sometimes you land exactly where you\u2019re supposed to be \u2014 even if you didn\u2019t plan it.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS\n\nThe Verdict:\n\n\"The Baltimorons\" is a charming, crowd-pleasing rom-com that can spice up your roster of go-to Christmas movies. Strassner and Larsen have you rooting for Cliff and Didi from start to finish, making this film worth checking out. And if you miss it in theaters, it can be a solid streamer at home under a cozy blanket later.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2014 SEE IT\n\n\"The Baltimorons\" is rated R for language. Running time: 1 hour, 39 minutes. In select theaters now."

                "text": "There\u2019s a new iPhone. Again. Improbably, we are on the 17th iteration (give or take) of the product that single-handedly ruins our lives every day with incessant vibrations alerting us to some horrifying calamity, plus every song in the Bruce Springsteen back catalog. Coming up with new features for the never-ending information machines we all keep in our pockets isn\u2019t easy, but this time, Apple managed to develop a big (or should I say small) one. There\u2019s now a thinner iPhone Air, which is being marketed as the thinnest iPhone ever. These gadgets have never exactly been gargantuan, so it\u2019s kind of like identifying the tiniest grain of sand in the desert. Still, people around the world are fascinated by the sheer lack of phone here.\n\nTechnology, design, and art are all trending toward a certain scarcity model, prepping us for a lack of bells and whistles, as though both your parents are unemployed and they want you to expect fewer trips to Disneyland. Life on Earth feels more and more like the experience of entering a Sweetgreen \u2013 beige, spartan and unobtrusive. Sure, iPhones haven\u2019t gotten cheaper, but they have certainly gotten \u2026 lesser. The iPhone Air is so small, I feel like I\u2019ll sit on it and it will slide seamlessly up my rectum, never to be seen again. For some, I\u2019m sure losing your device inside your bowels might be a feature, but I think it\u2019s a rather uncomfortable bug.\n\nTechnology used to be clunky and even a bit embarrassing, the domain of the lonely nerd. My family had a \u201ccomputer room\u201d for most of the 90s \u2013 the place we hid the gray, awkward Compaq PC that allowed me to access pornography, instant messaging apps, and Star Trek promo photos. Whatever dirty business needed to take place on that glowing screen was meant to be done in private. Computers were ugly, industrial machines for hard work or antisocial digital wandering. Then, Steve Jobs asked: \u201cWhat if that dumb gray box was beautiful, simple and cruelly trapped you in a never-ending cycle of desire and self-hatred? Plus, the entire back catalog of Bruce Springsteen.\u201d The first iPod and iPhone were descendants of the miraculous Macintosh computer, which revolutionized personal computing. But, for me, the height of Apple\u2019s design success was the colorful, translucent iMac desktop. Back in 1998, the iMac offered a computer that wasn\u2019t drab, but candy-coated, maximalist and something you\u2019d actually be able to stow in a place of honor in your home. It was true design and had more in common with the bold work of the Memphis Group design tradition than the stuffed shirts at IBM. The iMac looked like it should have been in Pee-wee\u2019s Playhouse rather than some dimly lit vestibule at my parents\u2019.\n\niPhones, on the other hand, value minimalism above all else. Yes, you can get them in various muted, metallic colors, or customize yours with a case that celebrates your favorite sports team or boldly declares that you \u201cCan\u2019t Be Arsed\u201d. But for the most part, Apple offers a clean brand of futurism where nothing about the object offends (except the content you can access with it). This is the way of everything now \u2013 minimalist wardrobes, bland farmhouse living rooms, restaurants so pared down that they barely register as more than a kitchen and some tables.\n\nWhile in London this summer, I saw the latest revival of the musical Evita at the Palladium, directed by the king of minimalist theater, Jamie Lloyd. Lloyd is known for sparse set design, barely there staging, and bold technological innovations in productions like the Tony Award-winning Sunset Boulevard. Evita is a period piece about the Argentine celebrity and political figure Eva Per\u00f3n. It takes place in the 1950s and was created in the 1970s. Historical context matters. It\u2019s usually staged with sumptuous sets and period-appropriate costuming. What Lloyd chose to do is strip all of that down, place its characters on a dark, nearly empty stage, and offer next to no sense of place or time. Evita, then, is presented to the audience inside a black void, with scantily clad dancers flailing about in front of a large, lit-up sign that says, simply: \u201cEVITA\u201d, in case you forgot what you wandered into. The dystopian phantom zone where Evita takes place is a manifestation of how it feels to live in the perpetually wired digital age of 2025. Lloyd is also responsible for a new production of Waiting for Godot in New York, which similarly has almost nothing on the stage for the actors to interact with. At least there, it\u2019s kind of warranted.\n\nI was one of the only people who walked out of Evita with a sour look on my face. The orgasmic rapture of the surrounding crowd made me feel like an old fool, desperate for ball gowns and flimsy plywood buildings. But what troubled me was the realization that this aesthetic isn\u2019t an outlier, it\u2019s the unquestioned norm. Less is considered more. Being \u201ctacky\u201d is seen as the greatest imaginable sin. Odd, considering who\u2019s the president of the United States and what he\u2019s done to the White House, but maybe that\u2019s the origin of all this cold minimalism. To be spare and quiet is to be the opposite of all that golden grotesquerie. Minimalism is the new status symbol of the upwardly mobile. Interior design is overrun with cold, Scandinavian influences. The art direction of HBO\u2019s Succession was a window into the tactile expression of iciness that defines the modern-day uber-rich. It leaves me feeling hollow, and as alone as I was in my parents\u2019 computer room.\n\nMinimalism is a means of control, a way to assert dominance over the physical space \u2013 rooms unsullied by thought, risk or humor. Minimalism\u2019s iron grip on reality is not honest or articulate. It\u2019s a manifestation of a world that is actually out of control. The iPhone screams chaos at us, but it looks clean and perfect. It\u2019s the ideal delivery device for madness, because it seems so restrained on the outside.\n\nEvita is a bloody tale of revolution and propaganda and authoritarianism. Staging it like Elvis\u2019s Las Vegas residency in the 1970s wipes all of that out. Without the culturally specific or historically significant aesthetic touches, it robs the story of anything that truly makes it a story at all. It\u2019s like being trapped in an empty room with a flashmob or a roving band of Santacon drunks. Minimalism sells us the notion that we can be masters of our environment, but the truth is, we have never had less control over our destiny."

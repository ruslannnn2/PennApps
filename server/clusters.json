            "Poland scrambles jets as Russia launches massive aerial assault on Ukraine": {
                "text of article": "Polish and allied military aircraft were scrambled early Saturday after Russia launched a massive aerial assault on Ukraine including strikes that targeted near its western border with Poland.\n\nIt came hours after NATO intercepted three Russian jets over Estonia’s airspace and with Europe on heightened alert following a series of Russian airspace violations in eastern countries.\n\n“Due to the activity of the Russian Federation’s long-range aviation, which is carrying out strikes on the territory of Ukraine, Polish and allied aviation has begun operating in our airspace,” the Polish military posted on X.\n\n“Duty fighter pairs have been scrambled, and ground-based air defense systems as well as radiolocation reconnaissance have reached a state of maximum readiness,” it said.\n\nRussia launched 579 attack drones and various types of dummy drones at Ukraine overnight into Saturday, Kyiv’s Air Force said. Moscow also launched eight ballistic missiles and 32 cruise missiles in the attack, it said.\n\n“All night, Ukraine was under a massive attack by Russia,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. He added that three people have been killed in the shelling and dozens more injured.\n\n“Every such strike is not a military necessity but a deliberate strategy by Russia to terrorize civilians and destroy our infrastructure,” he said. “That is why a strong international response is needed.”\n\nOverall, eight people were killed, and at least 32 injured, in Russian attacks over the last 24 hours, according to regional authorities.\n\nOn Friday, NATO intercepted three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets that violated Estonia’s airspace in what Estonia called an “unprecedentedly brazen” incident.\n\nThe country’s foreign ministry said the jets entered Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland without permission and remained there for a total of 12 minutes.\n\nItalian F-35 fighters that were stationed in Estonia as part of NATO’s Eastern Sentry operation, in addition to Swedish and Finnish aircraft, responded to the intrusion, NATO said.\n\nRussia denied its jets had entered Estonian airspace, insisting the flight was carried out “in strict accordance with international rules” and “without violating the borders of other countries.”\n\nEstonia has requested NATO Article 4 consultations following the violation, the mechanism which allows any member to formally bring an issue to the attention to NATO’s principle political decision-making body. A meeting is due to take place early next week.\n\nRussian drones violated both Polish and Romanian airspace earlier this month – prompting NATO allies to pledge to beef up defenses on the bloc’s eastern flank.\n\nAlso earlier this month, NATO fighter jets shot down multiple Russian drones that violated Polish airspace during an attack on Ukraine.\n\nThe operation marked the first time shots were fired by NATO since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which began in February 2022. The military alliance denounced Moscow’s “absolutely dangerous” behavior.",

            "Overtourism is leading to more car crashes in Scotland. T-plates might be the answer": {
                "text of article": "Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get news about destinations, plus the latest in aviation, food and drink, and where to stay.\n\nIn our travel roundup this week, a Scottish hotel owner has invented “tourist plates” to combat the rise in dangerous crashes on his nation’s roads. Plus, why Google Maps doesn’t work in one of Asia’s most developed countries – and how a government decision in October might change that.\n\nTourists and road safety\n\nIt was a white-knuckle drive through Tenerife that inspired Scottish man Robert Marshall to come up with Tourist Plate, an adhesive sticker travelers can put on their cars to alert other road users that they’re newbies to the area.\n\n“I was completely stressed, I was driving on the opposite side of the road from what I’m used to,” he says. “I couldn’t read the signs, but everybody was tailgating me. I shouted at my partner, ‘I wish these people knew I was a tourist, because they would just stay away from my car.’”\n\nIn the Scottish Highlands, where Marshall owns a hotel, there has been a rise in the number of serious road traffic accidents involving tourists. There have been close to 50 deaths in the past decade on the A9, Scotland’s longest road, which has gained notoriety for its regular changes from single to multiple-lane highway.\n\nLast year, the BBC reported local police were working with US Embassy officials to deliver safety advice to American visitors in particular. In May 2025, Transport Scotland reported that the number of crashes involving overseas drivers on the wrong side of the road had increased by 46% in a year.\n\n“We are suffering from overtourism,” says Laùra Hänsler, a safety campaigner for the A9, who has been working with Marshall on promoting his T-plates. “The infrastructure is practically on its knees because we’re straining to cope with it.”\n\nThe plates have yet to be officially endorsed by any authorities. When contacted by CNN, Transport Scotland said national driving standards, including the requirements for displaying vehicle plates, were a matter for the Department of Transport. But “as we understand it — as long as it’s not offensive, you can put what you like on your car.”\n\nThe plates have been generating buzz online and have been a particular hit on TikTok. Marshall says he’s received orders for the £9.99 plates (around $13.50, of which 10% goes to road-safety charities) from as far afield as the United States, Pakistan and India.\n\nIn a Facebook video demonstrating other road users’ reactions to the T-plate, Hänsler says that she tested the plates by going on the A9 and keeping to a steady 50 miles per hour (on a 60 mph road).\n\n“I let the vehicles gain on me, and you had that couple of seconds and then the comprehension, ‘Oh that’s different, that means something,’” she says.\n\nThe cars would then routinely pull back to give her space, for her safety and theirs.\n\n“That’s what it’s for,” she says. “On the A9, you don’t get the chance to have the split-second of a mistake. And that can cost you your life.”\n\nGetting around\n\nSo why do 70% of the world’s countries drive on the right-hand side of the road, but another 30% drive on the left?\n\nIn mainland Europe, the standardization of driving on the right began with the sweeping away of class distinctions in revolutionary France — the left had previously been the preserve of the carriage-riding wealthy.\n\nIn America, it goes back to pioneers and their wagons, and an adjustment that gave drivers more control over the vehicle.\n\nBut fast forward to 2025, and we’re still solving navigation problems. Google Maps, for example, is a ubiquitous tool used by tourists to get around new destinations, as well as their own cities.\n\nHowever, the popular map application doesn’t fully work in South Korea, despite it being, by other measures, a tech-savvy and tourist-friendly country.\n\nIt’s down to a decades-long struggle over a set of map data owned by the South Korean government, and geopolitical tensions have expanded to bigger questions of “digital sovereignty” and market dominance. A government decision is due this October.\n\nIn parts of Europe, tourist information booths are becoming a thing of the past — Scotland has announced that all of its centers will shut by the end of 2025 — but in Asian countries including South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, they’re enjoying a boom. South Korea had about 300 tourist information centers in 2015. Now, the number has more than doubled.\n\n“Asian tourists generally value structured guidance and interpersonal explanations,” Xiang Li, a Hong Kong hospitality expert, told CNN. “In contrast, European tourists are more accustomed to self-guided experiences.”\n\n‘To Nice’ or Tunis\n\nTwo American friends traveling across Europe went viral after one posted videos of the pair accidentally boarding a plane to Tunis, Tunisia, instead of “to Nice,” France. They say their month-long trip has been full of mishaps, but they’ve enjoyed every second.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nA couple was fined and banned from Venice after swimming in the Grand Canal.\n\nThey were sent back to the UK on the same day they arrived.\n\nThese are the North American airports that travelers find the most satisfying.\n\nOverall, passengers are a little happier than last year.\n\nSome Americans are “flag-jacking” when traveling abroad.\n\nCanadians are livid.\n\nA Chinese airline has launched a 29-hour “direct flight.”",

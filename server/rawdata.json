Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, pushed back on that timeline in an interview last week.\u201cThat can\u2019t happen,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cWe\u2019re up against a real deadline.

Another section of GOP hardliners want to completely axe the subsidies, providing another wrinkle for GOP leaders to work through as centrists raise concerns about the fallout in their districts.\n\nFitzpatrick \u2014 a member of the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over the subsidies \u2014 confirmed that the income cap and other reforms have come up in private talks with centrist House lawmakers over an extension.House Democrats, meanwhile, generally want a longer extension with fewer limitations on enrollees. Even Democrats in the Problem Solvers Caucus caution they haven\u2019t agreed to anything or seriously discussed the details of an income cap. Any final agreement, they note, will have to be negotiated and blessed by top congressional leaders.\n\nIf an extension deal can\u2019t be struck quickly around the shutdown standoff, Fitzpatrick and other worried Republicans are planning to push for passage of a standalone bill in October before insurers start to lock in pricing for 2026.\n\n\u201cA lot of our folks back home are talking about this,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big deal.\u201d"

                "text": "President Donald Trump scrapped a White House meeting with top congressional Democrats later this week, as the threat of a government shutdown looms over Washington.\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Tuesday morning.\n\nThe president also rattled off a list of demands he claimed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries want in exchange for their party\u2019s votes to keep the government funded and avert a shutdown on October 1. The pair had confirmed just shortly before that they were scheduled to meet with the president this week in the Oval Office.\n\nWhile a single meeting between Trump and the Democrats was unlikely to result in a swift deal to avert a shutdown altogether, it had been the most tangible indication yet that party leaders would come to the table to negotiate on funding. Now, with each party publicly trading barbs and refusing to cave, the prospect of a shutdown seems more serious than ever.\n\nLawmakers left Washington on Friday for a week in their home districts without a path forward, after the Senate rejected both a House-passed seven-week government funding measure and a Democratic alternative.\n\nRepublicans have argued their bill to fund the government through November 20 is a \u201cclean\u201d continuing resolution, or CR, with only $30 million in extra security money for members of Congress, $58 million for security for the executive and judicial branch and a funding \u201cfix\u201d for DC to adjust a mistake in an earlier bill.\n\nThe Democratic bill, meanwhile, included expensive health care changes, such as extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans have argued it\u2019s inappropriate to add such provisions to a stopgap funding bill and that they should be negotiated as part of a year-end funding bill.\n\nMeeting pulled after call with top Republicans\n\nTrump\u2019s move to cancel the Thursday meeting came after a conversation with GOP leaders Monday night, where they cautioned against dealmaking with Democrats, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n\nTrump spoke by phone with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune about the upcoming funding deadline, shortly after reports surfaced that the president was planning to meet with Schumer and Jeffries.\n\nOn the call, the GOP leaders told the president that Schumer was seeking a shutdown brawl with him, and they panned Democrats\u2019 demand to make enhanced Obamacare subsidies permanent as essentially giving free health care to illegal migrants, that person said.\n\n\u201cThune has been abundantly clear about what he thinks on this issue, and the president is aware of his position,\u201d one source familiar with the discussions told CNN.\n\nJohnson made a similar case against the Affordable Care Act enhanced premium subsidies inside the Capitol last week before lawmakers left town, telling reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to pay for health care for illegal aliens, that\u2019s against the law, we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters shortly before Trump\u2019s post that he and Senate Majority Leader John Thune would attend any meeting that took place with Democratic leaders, but he questioned whether a meeting was necessary.\n\n\u201cChuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries have made just wild partisan demands that they\u2019re trying to attach to a very simple, short term, very clean CR. We just want to keep the government open so our appropriators can continue to do their work,\u201d he told reporters, accusing his Democratic colleagues of \u201ctrying to make a mockery of it.\u201d\n\nDemocrats accuse Trump of \u2018running away\u2019\n\nAhead of the cancellation, Schumer and Jeffries sought to center their funding demands around health care, much as they have in recent weeks.\n\nThey were planning in the meeting, they said, to \u201cemphasize the importance of addressing rising costs, including the Republican healthcare crisis\u201d and argued it was \u201cpast time to meet and work to avoid a Republican-caused shutdown.\u201d\n\nBut after after it became clear they would not have their anticipated audience with the president, the party leaders struck a much sharper tone.\n\nJeffries invoked a phrase on X that has been known to irk the president: \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out,\u201d while Schumer \u2013 who would have to deliver Republicans seven votes to pass the GOP stopgap measure in the Senate \u2013 accused Trump of throwing a tantrum and \u201crunning away from the negotiating table before he even gets there.\u201d\n\nJeffries also told his House members they should return to Washington Monday, even though GOP leaders canceled votes on the eve of the funding deadline.\n\n\u201cDemocrats will be in town and prepared to get the job done,\u201d he wrote.\n\nJohnson appeared unlikely to bring members back to Washington early, maintaining that the current plan was to keep lawmakers in their home districts.\n\n\u201cWe got our work done in the House. We got it done early with regard to the funding,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. \u201cPeople had a lot to do back in their districts, and so we\u2019re on the ready at any time but the plan would be to come back when it\u2019s necessary, but the current plan is to not have session days on September 29 and 30.\u201d\n\nTrump left the door open Tuesday to meeting in the future, provided Democrats \u201cbecome realistic about the things our Country stands for.\u201d Those talks would be necessary, Jeffries said, if Republicans wanted Democratic votes.\n\n\u201cWe have to have a conversation with Donald Trump, or Republican leaders in the Congress, in order to try to find common ground in ways that can prevent a government shutdown if Republicans expect Democratic votes,\u201d Jeffries said during a press conference in Brooklyn.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

The situation is complicated by the need for bipartisan support in the Senate to overcome the filibuster, with both parties positioning themselves ahead of the midterm elections.",
                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "The US government is drawing nearer to a potential shutdown after Donald Trump told Republicans on Friday \u201cdon\u2019t even bother dealing with\u201d the Democrats, whose congressional leaders are refusing to support spending bills that do not include their healthcare priorities.\n\nCongress is up against an end-of-the-month deadline to approve legislation funding the federal government, otherwise many departments will stop work and employees will be told to stay home. While the Senate and House of Representatives have made some progress on passing the 12 appropriations bills that make up the budget, it seems certain that Congress will need to pass a short-term measure to keep the government open beyond 30 September.\n\nOn Thursday, the top House and Senate Democrats said they would not support any legislation that does not meet their demands on healthcare.\n\n\u201cWe will not support a partisan spending agreement that continues to rip away healthcare from the American people, period, full stop,\u201d said Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News on Friday morning, Trump insisted that Republicans should go it alone on spending \u2013 a tall ask because Democrats can use the Senate\u2019s filibuster to block legislation in the upper chamber.\n\n\u201cThey want to give away money to this and then that, destroy the country. If you gave them every dream, they would not vote for it,\u201d Trump said of the Democrats. He said he had told Republicans: \u201cDon\u2019t even bother dealing with them.\u201d\n\nThe squabble is developing as Democrats face pressure from their base to use whatever leverage they have in Congress to stand up to Trump, with an eye towards retaking control of at least one chamber in next year\u2019s midterm elections. While Jeffries and other top Democrats have been vague about what exactly they are demanding in exchange for keeping the government open, they appear to want to undo changes to Medicaid and other federal health insurance programs imposed by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act Republicans passed in July.\n\nThey have also pushed for an extension of subsidies for the premiums charged by Affordable Care Act plans, warning that millions of Americans will be forced to pay more for health coverage if they are not renewed.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re already feeling it,\u201d said Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader. \u201cIn several states, notices have gone out already how your healthcare premiums and your insurance is going to go way up, hundreds of dollars.\u201d\n\nMany unanswered questions remain in the appropriations process, including how long a short-term funding bill would last, and if it would encompass any spending bills that the parties have found agreement on. With Republicans able to pass most legislation through the House with a simple majority, the spending battle is likely to center on the Senate, where the GOP will need to win the support of at least seven Democrats to overcome the filibuster.\n\nIn an interview with Punchbowl News on Friday, the Senate majority leader, John Thune, said he expected the House to pass, with Trump\u2019s support, a short-term bill to stretch government funding for seven weeks to the Thanksgiving holiday, the goal being to give appropriators more time to finish their work. He accused Democrats of seeking confrontation for political reasons.\n\n\u201cI think that they see it as politically advantageous to have a shutdown. I think that their base is clamoring for that,\u201d Thune said.\n\n\u201cThey want to fight with the Trump administration. They don\u2019t have a good reason to do it, and I don\u2019t intend to give them a good reason to do it.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are wary of a repeat of the funding squabble that occurred earlier this year, when Schumer and a handful of Democratic senators reluctantly supported legislation to keep the government funded, arguing that letting spending lapse so early in Trump\u2019s term would undermine their ability to resist his attempts to remake the federal government.\n\nThey are now facing pressure from activist groups such as MoveOn, which said in a memo sent to Democratic leadership earlier this week that the party should \u201crefuse support for any funding bill that doesn\u2019t reverse Republicans\u2019 massive healthcare cuts\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no denying that Democrats are left with little legislative power as Republicans control all three branches of government. But that is exactly why Democrats have to use every ounce of leverage we have surrounding the September 30 funding deadline to prove the Democratic party\u2019s commitment to fighting like hell for the American people,\u201d read the memo, which was first reported by Politico.\n\nDemocrats hope to win back the House next year, which the GOP controls by a majority that is no larger than three seats. In an interview with NBC News, the congresswoman Suzan DelBene, who leads House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, said Republicans should be blamed for any shutdown.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re heading for a shutdown, it\u2019s because that\u2019s where they\u2019re leading us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to be at the table. Republicans don\u2019t even know what they want to do. They\u2019re in charge. They have all the levers.\u201d"

At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.\n\nBut the findings of the report have been challenged by aviation safety group Safety Matters Foundation, which is calling for an independent investigation into the crash.\n\nIn a court hearing overseeing the aviation safety group's petition, one of India's Supreme Court judges said that suggestions that the pilots deliberately shut off fuel supply were \"very unfortunate and irresponsible\".\n\nThe crash has left many questioning the safety of India's airspace.\n\nThe chief of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has defended the safety record of the country, telling the BBC in July that \"India's skies have always been safe\".\n\nThat same month, the DGCA uncovered 51 safety violations at Air India in the preceding year, as part of its annual audit of the country's airlines.\n\nThe families of four passengers who died on the plane filed a lawsuit in the US against planemaker Boeing and aircraft parts maker Honeywell, accusing the companies of negligence.\n\nThe lawsuit accused the companies of doing \"nothing\" despite being aware of the risks of the aircraft's design."

Many pointed to the FCC chair\u2019s podcast interview where he suggested the commission could take action if Disney didn\u2019t. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was among the voices on the right who were critical of the FCC, comparing it to a mob shakedown.\n\nWhen Sinclair refused to return Kimmel to its airwaves, Wiener appeared to threaten the company with government action.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t wait to break Sinclair up.

On Monday evening, Disney announced that the show would return following discussions with Kimmel\u2019s team and network representatives. However, two of the major affiliate operators have not reversed course.\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nlist of 4 items\n\nlist 1 of 4US pledges to do \u2018what is needed\u2019 to support Argentina\u2019s economy\n\nlist 2 of 4Only 1.2% of over one billion Africans have access to 5G networks: Report\n\nlist 3 of 4Trump\u2019s H-1B visa fee hike: Which countries could benefit?\n\nlist 4 of 4Trump proposes new H-1B visa process prioritising highly skilled workers\n\nend of list\n\nKeeping the show off those affiliate TV stations significantly cuts into Kimmel\u2019s reach. Nexstar and Sinclair together own and operate 70 of the 250 ABC stations across the United States, putting them at odds with the network.\n\nNexstar\u2019s vested interest\n\nABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s show after the comedian made remarks about the killing of conservative figure Charlie Kirk. The suspension came just hours after Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chair Brendan Carr warned that stations carrying the show could face fines, or even lose their broadcast licences, urging them to \u201cstep up\u201d.\n\nCarr\u2019s comments drew pushback across the political spectrum, including from US President Donald Trump\u2019s allies. Texas Senator Ted Cruz called Carr\u2019s remarks \u201cdangerous as hell\u201d, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Cruz \u201cgot it right\u201d.\n\nNexstar owns 23 ABC affiliates and is currently pursuing a $6.2bn merger with competitor Tegna, a deal requiring FCC approval. If completed, the combined company would reach 80 percent of US households, far above the current 39 percent cap, and would require a policy change. Carr has long supported removing that cap.\n\n\u201cNexstar\u2019s capitulation in hopes of gaining approval for its merger with Tegna is actually Exhibit A in why it should not be allowed to merge with Tegna. Large conglomerates have enormous leverage to facilitate the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on free speech, both by censoring themselves and by bullying the networks,\u201d Seth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told Al Jazeera.\n\nCarr praised Nexstar last week for dropping Kimmel from its affiliates in markets such as Salt Lake City, Nashville and New Orleans.\n\nMargot Susca, professor of journalism, accountability,and democracy at the American University in Washington, DC, said the FCC\u2019s pressure on Kimmel sets a troubling precedent.\n\n\u201cI think what is concerning is that it\u2019s Jimmy Kimmel now, but it could be Meet The Press [which airs on NBC] next year if another corporate media owner needs to make a deal and the Trump administration or Brendan Carr\u2026 say they don\u2019t like a segment that comes on a news programme. These are dark days for the content that appears on broadcast television,\u201d Susca said.\n\nOther media experts argue the issue is rooted in the leverage affiliate owners hold.\n\nIn the US, affiliate operators license programming from networks and pay carriage fees to do so. Affiliation typically brings more viewers, and thus, more advertising revenue, which is shared between networks and affiliates. Affiliates can preempt network programming, often for local news during severe weather events or political debates, for instance.\n\n\u201cThey [TV station operators] can simply not run those programmes because they don\u2019t really need the networks as much as they did at one time,\u201d Tom Letizia, media consultant and head of political communications firm the Letizia Agency, told Al Jazeera, referring to the global trend of viewers finding their content on social media or streaming platforms.\n\n\u201cThis is more about making a profit, and that\u2019s really what this business is about. Let\u2019s not forget that. I mean, ratings are the lifeblood of a TV station. If you don\u2019t have ratings, you can\u2019t charge your advertisers a premium cost for that spot.\u201d\n\nA lot of the advertising spend in smaller markets comes from local political parties, and if the politics do not align, those advertising dollars could be cut.\n\nNexstar said it stands by its decision to preempt Kimmel indefinitely and will \u201cmonitor the show as it returns to ABC\u201d. The company denied political involvement or pressure from the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThe decision to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! was made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision,\u201d a Nexstar spokesman told Al Jazeera.\n\nSinclair\u2019s stance\n\nSinclair Broadcasting said on Monday that it does not plan to resume airing Kimmel\u2019s show on its 38 ABC affiliates, opting instead for news programming.\n\nThe company, the second-largest US station operator after Nexstar, pushed Kimmel to apologise and \u201cmake a meaningful personal donation to the Kirk Family and Turning Point USA\u201d, Kirk\u2019s conservative activist organisation.\n\nSinclair has long faced criticism for its conservative leanings. David Smith, the company\u2019s executive chairman, donated $250,000 in 2024 to Kirk\u2019s Turning Point USA through the David D Smith Family Foundation, whose listed address matches Sinclair\u2019s headquarters.\n\nIn 2018, Sinclair required local anchors to read a script criticising \u201cone-sided media coverage\u201d, which Trump, then in his first term in office, praised. This came as the company pursued a $3.9bn merger with Tribune Media at the time, a deal that ultimately collapsed after Tribune pulled out.\n\n\u201cAs the owners of the stations, they can make the choices over what their content is. Sinclair is a pretty right-wing organisation,\u201d Susca said.\n\n\u201cWhen they buy a station in a local market, it tacks coverage to the right. They focus more on national politics.\u201d\n\nA 2019 study in the American Political Science Review found that Sinclair stations leaned more conservative than their competitors in the same markets.\n\n\u201cDiscussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show\u2019s potential return,\u201d Sinclair said in a statement. The company did not respond to Al Jazeera\u2019s request for further comment.\n\nDisney\u2019s decision\n\nDisney\u2019s move to reinstate Kimmel comes amid widespread public pressure. Celebrities and elected officials called for boycotts of Disney-owned platforms, including Disney+, ESPN and Hulu, in the wake of his suspension.\n\nGoogle Trends data showed that searches to cancel those platforms spiked to their highest-ever levels following the suspension.\n\nABC directly owns only eight stations, including in New York and Houston. WABC in New York faced political backlash when leading mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani pulled out of a debate it was set to host, citing ABC\u2019s suspension of Kimmel.\n\n\u201cBroadcast media is a business. Make no mistake that Kimmel being taken off the air was a business decision. Kimmel being put back on the air is a business decision,\u201d Susca said.\n\nDisney\u2019s stock has fallen 2.78 percent over the past five days.\n\nLaura Crompton, a media analyst and head of global communications agency Hopscotch\u2019s Los Angeles office, said that Tuesday\u2019s show could provide a ratings boost.\n\n\u201cFor now, it seems they\u2019ve chosen to put things right and show that they won\u2019t cower to overreach or threats. But something tells me this isn\u2019t over yet. If we want to find a silver lining, I suspect Kimmel\u2019s comeback show tonight will smash audience numbers, even without the 25 percent of audiences disenfranchised by the ongoing standoff regionally. And realistically, I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all relieved we don\u2019t have to take the moral high road and give up our Disney+ favorite shows now,\u201d Crompton told Al Jazeera.\n\nDisney did not respond to Al Jazeera\u2019s request for comment."

Carr wrote that \u201clocal TV stations \u2014 for the first time in years \u2014 stood up to a national programmer & chose to exercise their lawful right to preempt programming.\u201d\n\nTuesday night\u2019s guests of \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d will be actor Glen Powell, with musical guest Sarah McLachlan. The show will feature Ethan Hawke, Lisa Ann Walter and musical guest Yungblud on Wednesday, and Peyton Manning, Oscar Nu\u00f1ez and musical guest Alex G on Thursday.\n\nBoth Powell and MacLachlan are promoting Disney-owned projects: Powell for Hulu\u2019s upcoming sports comedy series \u201cChad Powers,\u201d and MacLachlan is behind the Hulu documentary \u201cLilith Fair: Building a Mystery,\u201d which follows the \u201990s-era female-focused music festival founded by MacLachlan.\n\nThis past weekend, while Kimmel\u2019s show was off air, MacLachlan refused to perform at the documentary\u2019s premiere, stating that she was taking a stand in support of free speech.\n\nHow we got here\n\nThe Kimmel controversy erupted last week after conservatives criticized a Kimmel monologue comment on Monday about the MAGA responses to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.\n\nBoth Nexstar and Sinclair condemned Kimmel and contributed to ABC parent Disney\u2019s decision to pull the show from the airwaves temporarily.\n\nKimmel said the MAGA movement was trying to score political points by trying to prove that the 22-year-old suspect accused of killing Kirk is not one of its own.\n\n\u201cThe MAGA Gang (is) desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cIn between the finger-pointing, there was grieving.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, two days after the monologue aired, Carr publicly suggested Kimmel should be suspended and invoked the FCC\u2019s oversight of local TV stations.\n\nWithin a matter of hours two big station groups, Sinclair and Nexstar, signaled that they would preempt Kimmel\u2019s show locally, and then ABC suspended the show altogether, a stunning move that started a national debate about government interference and freedom of speech.\n\nDisney tried to explain its decision-making in a Monday afternoon statement announcing Kimmel\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cLast Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\u201d the Disney statement said. \u201cIt is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nKimmel is planning to address the controversy in his monologue on Tuesday night, a source familiar with Kimmel\u2019s plans told CNN. His show airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET.\n\nMedia analysts have watched as Disney CEO Bob Iger and Disney Entertainment co-chairman Dana Walden have navigated competing pressures. Disney needs government approval for pending deals like ESPN\u2019s pact with the NFL, while many of ABC\u2019s station partners are in the same boat. Additionally, Kimmel\u2019s contract is expiring in May and late-night TV audiences and revenue have been in decline.\n\nKimmel\u2019s sudden suspension sent shock waves through the entertainment industry, where the comedian and long-time host is well-regarded, both inside and outside ABC.\n\nHis show employs between 200 and 250 people.\n\nThere were organized protests against Disney outside of the company\u2019s offices in New York and Burbank, California over the past week, as well as outside the theater where Kimmel\u2019s show is recorded in Hollywood.\n\nBefore news of Kimmel\u2019s pending return on Monday, more than 400 artists, including Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep and Jennifer Aniston, signed an open letter, organized by the ACLU, in support of Kimmel.\n\nLater, ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said ABC \u201cmade the right call\u201d in returning Kimmel to air.\n\n\u201cIt should never have suspended him to begin with and resisted the government\u2019s desire to control what people say,\u201d Romero said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHopefully, other media outlets will also find their spines and resist the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to cudgel them into obeisance,\u201d he added.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers also celebrated news of Kimmel\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cThank you to everyone but @BrendanCarrFCC,\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on X. \u201cThis is a win for free speech everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is big: Jimmy Kimmel is coming back!\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on X. \u201cThis is about fighting for free speech and against these abuses by Donald Trump and Brendan Carr.\u201d\n\nCarr did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nCarr\u2019s FCC colleague Anna M. Gomez, the lone Democrat on the commission, said in a statement, \u201cI am glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation. More importantly, I want to thank those Americans from across the ideological spectrum who spoke loudly and courageously against this blatant attempt to silence free speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will continue to be up to us as citizens to push back against this Administration\u2019s growing campaign of censorship and control,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nPEN America, one of the many free expression groups that criticized Disney for seemingly caving to the Trump administration, called Kimmel\u2019s return \u201ca vindication for free speech.\u201d\n\nThe ABC announcement is both \u201cremedying his unjustifiable suspension, and reminding us that when people speak out to hold the powerful to account \u2013 it matters,\u201d PEN America interim co-CEO Summer Lopez said. \u201cWe must all channel the same energy to fight the many assaults on free speech underway, including against those with less reach and resources.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s David Goldman, Lisa Respers France and Lex Harvey contributed to this story."

But it sparked condemnation from Hollywood talent, unions, media pundits, other talkshow hosts and even Republican politicians like Ted Cruz, who likened Carr\u2019s threats to that of a mob boss.\n\n\u201cThe right to speak our minds and to disagree with each other \u2013 to disturb, even \u2013 is at the very heart of what it means to be a free people,\u201d the Writers Guild of America wrote in a blistering statement. \u201cIt is not to be denied. Not by violence, not by the abuse of governmental power, nor by acts of corporate cowardice.\u201d\n\nEarlier Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) released an open letter condemning Disney\u2019s decision signed by more than 400 Hollywood stars including Jennifer Aniston, Ben Affleck, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro.\n\nThough production of Kimmel\u2019s show will resume as usual Tuesday, it remains unclear how available the broadcast will be. The show will, as ever, be available online after the ABC broadcast."

                "source": "nytimes",
                "text": "EAGAN, Minn. \u2014 NFL teams are like most businesses in that they have to manage short-term and long-term priorities. Wins are like dollars. You can only go so long before questions start being asked about the returns.\n\nThis is one of the things that makes developing young players so difficult. The pressure to perform each Sunday does not subside because a particular player is getting his feet wet.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true at quarterback.\n\nKevin O\u2019Connell, the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 head coach, has not shied away from this reality. He knows what J.J. McCarthy is: young, inexperienced and in the preliminary stages of his career. O\u2019Connell also knows the standard. The Vikings are not spending $346 million on their 2025 roster \u2014 the most of any NFL team \u2014 to go without a playoff win for the sixth straight season.\n\nMarrying the present and future was always going to be a delicate dance, one that only seemed doable because of O\u2019Connell\u2019s deftness. The offense\u2019s poor showing in the first two weeks highlighted the complexity of the balancing act. McCarthy\u2019s high ankle sprain threw a wrench in the roadmap.\n\nOn Monday, O\u2019Connell confirmed that McCarthy, 22, would be making the trip overseas to Dublin and London with the rest of the team. However, McCarthy\u2019s return-to-play timeline is murky. O\u2019Connell has already said McCarthy won\u2019t play on Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers. CBS analyst Tracy Wolfson reported this weekend that the plan was for McCarthy to return following the Week 6 bye, but O\u2019Connell said that was inaccurate.\n\n\u201cWhat is accurate is the idea that I believe J.J. would go out there and tough it out today or tomorrow if we asked him to,\u201d O\u2019Connell said Monday. \u201cTo me, at this point in a very young career, his mobility is one of his weapons that has clearly already shown to be something that\u2019s a positive for him. So, we want to make sure he\u2019s healthy.\u201d\n\nLater, responding to a question about his overall commitment to McCarthy once the ankle is fully healed, O\u2019Connell said that McCarthy needs to practice for a full week.\n\n\u201cWe saw, as phenomenal as he was getting prepared for the Atlanta game (after the birth of his son), he did miss practice that week,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re in the phase of building up the 10,000 reps and 10,000 hours it takes to play the position at a very high level, which we know J.J. McCarthy is going to do, you can\u2019t cut corners on that.\n\n\u201cAnd (the initial question) also doesn\u2019t require an answer today.\u201d\n\nThe question is relevant in the aftermath of Carson Wentz\u2019s successful debut Sunday. While not flawless, Wentz did what had not been done enough in seven of the team\u2019s first eight quarters. He effectively operated the offense.\n\nWentz completed 70 percent of his passes and, most critically, did not commit a turnover. The most stark difference between his and McCarthy\u2019s play may have been how quickly he got rid of the ball. The numbers back up the observation. Whereas McCarthy released his passes within 2.5 seconds only 17.1 percent of the time, Wentz did it on 60 percent of his attempts.\n\nChanges in the quarterback\u2019s surroundings mattered. Left tackle Christian Darrisaw, who didn\u2019t play the first two weeks, returned. Efficiency in the run game put the Vikings in optimal downs and distances. An early defensive touchdown eased some of the stress. The Cincinnati Bengals defense also seemed a tad less multiple than what McCarthy witnessed against the Chicago Bears and Atlanta Falcons.\n\nStill, Wentz consistently attacked the middle of the field, a staple of O\u2019Connell\u2019s offense since he arrived in 2022. Processing capacity is one of the reasons he was able to do it. O\u2019Connell also cited Wentz\u2019s \u201cfirm and repeatable fundamentals normally within the lower half of the quarterback\u2019s mechanics.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tie those things together,\u201d O\u2019Connell said, \u201cand then you have a system. Then you have rhythm. \u2026 Sometimes, it\u2019s the reactionary ability to still consistently play with the poise and decision-making. All of that becomes much easier when you\u2019re taking the right footwork and (are) balanced throughout the drop and reading with your feet. That can be an incredible weapon for a quarterback, whether they\u2019ve played 20 years or two games. I think there\u2019s value in J.J. seeing that.\u201d\n\nLast year, Sam Darnold used the phrase \u201cfeet and eyes\u201d constantly. It had a purpose. The Vikings offense is structured in a way where, as long as the quarterback scans fluidly, receivers should be galloping into their field of vision. Breakdowns happen when protection crumbles, or when the quarterback cannot maintain the correct timing (and requisite accuracy) to find those receivers in stride.\n\nThat\u2019s where McCarthy erred the first two weeks, even though he was not nearly the sole culprit in those struggles. The offensive line had issues. Quick-pass opportunities weren\u2019t prevalent. Even in Week 1, receiver detail did not match expectations. But McCarthy didn\u2019t help the matter with a 24.4 percent bad throw rate, according to Pro Football Reference. The metric is described as \u201cthrows that weren\u2019t catchable with normal effort.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s number is almost six percent higher than that of any other qualified quarterback.\n\nHow much of his inaccuracy was a result of the ankle injury he sustained against Atlanta? Was it fair to expect McCarthy\u2019s processing capability to adapt to the NFL game with a two-week sample size? And, perhaps most important, will the Vikings have the stomach to thrust McCarthy back into the fire if Wentz is still moving the offense?\n\nTo O\u2019Connell\u2019s earlier point, the last topic of conversation is getting ahead of things. But it\u2019s too relevant now not to consider. The answer will reveal a great deal about the team\u2019s priorities \u2014 both in the short and long term.\n\n(Photo: Michael Reaves / Getty Images)"

The petition, initiated by Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, has already garnered 217 signatures and may gain traction following the upcoming special election, with both Grijalva and her Republican opponent pledging their support. Meanwhile, in Atlanta, the tragic death of Cornelius Taylor during a police clearing of a homeless encampment has ignited public outrage and calls for reform in how the city handles homelessness, although many proposed changes have faced resistance and inadequate implementation. Advocates argue that despite some progress, the ongoing criminalization of homelessness continues to harm vulnerable populations.",

                "text": "Grijalva \u2014 who is heavily favored to succeed her late father, Ra\u00fal Grijalva, in a district Trump lost by 22 points \u2014 said she will be pleased to force the issue. She would be eligible to sign immediately after she is sworn in, likely early next month.\n\n\u201cThis is as much about fulfilling Congress\u2019 duty as a constitutional check on this administration as it is about demanding justice for survivors,\u201d she said. \u201cThe days of turning a blind eye to Trump must end.\u201d\n\nGrijalva\u2019s signature would complete a process launched by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) after the Epstein controversy exploded over the summer, cornering Republican leaders between Trump and GOP voters who have insisted on transparency in the government\u2019s handling of the abuser.\n\nThe discharge petition allows Massie and Khanna to sidestep Johnson, who has instead supported a House Oversight Committee probe into Epstein. It would force a floor vote requiring publication of all Justice Department records related to the sex offender, with limited exceptions to protect victims.\n\nJohnson has options, however. He can seek to block the discharge effort in the Rules Committee, which he nominally controls, but he has faced a string of mutinies there over Epstein in recent weeks. Or he can let the bipartisan Epstein bill proceed to the floor, where it\u2019s very likely to pass, extending the controversy and handing the hot potato to Senate GOP leaders.\n\nAsked last week about the dilemma, Johnson said he wasn\u2019t ready to make a call.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about any of that,\u201d he said in a brief interview before leaving the Capitol Friday, adding that the discharge vote was a \u201cmoot point.\u201d He referenced a House vote this month that directed the Oversight panel to continue its probe without explicitly requiring the Justice Department to release the files.\n\n\u201cThe Oversight Committee is working overtime on this,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey\u2019re releasing every single page of documents every time they receive one. I mean, it\u2019s all out in the open. It genuinely is a moot point.\u201d\n\nBehind closed doors, Johnson has told Republicans in recent weeks he wouldn\u2019t force the Rules Committee to short-circuit the discharge petition. Johnson and GOP leaders have also acknowledged in private that a floor vote is likely if the petition gets 218 signatures, as POLITICO reported earlier this month.\n\nHouse Rules Chair Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) also said in a brief interview earlier this month that her panel would not intervene in the discharge petition and block a floor vote on Massie-Khanna bill.\n\nWhite House operatives have been aware for weeks that the petition was on track to receive the necessary 218 signatures without any additional GOP support, according to two Trump officials granted anonymity to comment on internal dealings. Rep. James Walkinshaw (D-Va.) became the 217th supporter after winning a special election earlier this month. Grijalva\u2019s victory has not been in much doubt.\n\nTrump has stewed over the matter. Earlier this month, he argued on the Truth Social that DOJ \u201chas done its job\u201d and \u201cgiven everything requested of them,\u201d adding that it\u2019s \u201ctime to end the Democrat Epstein Hoax.\u201d\n\nDespite White House pressure, three Republican women \u2014 Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Nancy Mace (S.C.) and Lauren Boebert (Colo.) \u2014 have declined to remove their names from the discharge petition. They have cast their decisions to sign as a gesture of support for Epstein\u2019s victims and for transparency.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the most courageous women I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Greene said after meeting some of them earlier this month. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t have been a battle, and unfortunately, it has been one.\u201d\n\nIf the bipartisan bill goes to the floor, other House Republicans who didn\u2019t sign onto the discharge effort are expected to join the three women in supporting the measure \u2014 possibly many more.\n\nThat could ramp up pressure on Senate Republicans to take action, though Majority Leader John Thune has so far beaten back several Democratic efforts to surface the Epstein issue in that chamber. He has declined to say how the Senate might act on the Massie-Khanna measure.\n\nSome Republicans have recognized that burying the issue could be untenable for party leaders.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s too many options,\u201d Rep. Riley Moore (R-W.Va.) told reporters when asked about the House discharge petition in late August. \u201cI think you have to take it up, right?\u201d"

                "text": "A special election in Arizona on Tuesday is expected to deliver the decisive signature to the push for a vote to release the Jeffrey Epstein case files.\n\nThe race in Arizona\u2019s 7th Congressional District will determine who will fill the seat vacated by the late Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva, who died from cancer in March. Grijalva\u2019s daughter, Adelita Grijalva, is looking to follow in her father\u2019s footsteps. She is heavily favored against Republican Daniel Butierez, who ran for the seat against the elder Grijalva in 2024, losing the race by 26 points.\n\nA discharge petition circulated by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, needs 218 House members to sign on to force leadership to hold a vote to release the Epstein files. The pair notched their 217th signature earlier this month when Democratic Rep. James Walkinshaw, fresh off winning a special election in Virginia\u2019s 11th District, was sworn in and signed the petition.\n\nBoth Grijalva and Butierez told the Arizona Daily Star last week they were committed to signing the Epstein petition if elected. In a statement to CNN, Grijalva said the issue \u201chas definitely come up\u201d on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cWe are hearing from voters that they believe the survivors deserve justice, and Congress must fulfill its duty to check the executive branch and hold Trump accountable,\u201d she said in the statement.\n\nIt\u2019s a vote House GOP leaders have tried to avoid for months. Speaker Mike Johnson adjourned the House a day early in July before Congress\u2019 month-long summer recess to avoid votes related to the files.\n\nSpeaking to CNN at the Capitol last week, Massie said he thought the House could vote as soon as mid-October on his Epstein bill, citing the Arizona special election as the catalyst for the 218th signature.\n\nOnce securing the needed signatures, Massie has to wait at least seven legislative days before bringing the bill to the floor, and House leaders can also take up to two legislative days before they put it to a vote.\n\nThe House is out of session this week, delaying any immediate trigger of the legislative calendar.\n\nDischarge petitions historically have a bad track record of actually forcing a vote on the floor, mostly because lawmakers in the majority are wary of taking a stand against leadership. The Epstein issue, however, has animated some Republican members, with Trump allies like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina signing onto the petition.\n\nWhile few Republicans have backed the effort to force a vote, a number have have expressed support for the underlying bill. Still, it would face an uphill battle in the Senate if it cleared the House.\n\nAfter the Arizona seat is filled, there will be two vacancies in the House due to Texas Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner\u2019s death in March and Tennessee Republican Rep. Mark Green\u2019s departure in July. An all-party primary for Turner\u2019s seat is scheduled for November 4, but it could require a runoff, and the election for Green\u2019s seat will be held December 2.\n\nAlthough another potential Democratic win would further chip away at Johnson\u2019s thin 219-213 majority, it would not change the fact that he currently can only afford to lose two Republicans on party-line votes with full attendance.\n\nArizona\u2019s 7th District, which stretches along the state\u2019s southern border with Mexico and includes parts of Tucson and the Phoenix area, is solidly Democratic and voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris by more than 22 percentage points in November.\n\nGrijalva won the Democratic primary in July over a field that included former state Rep. Daniel Hernandez and 25-year-old activist Deja Foxx."

                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "For the first time since she stopped calling it home, Lolita Griffeth set foot on Old Wheat Street, tucked behind Atlanta\u2019s historic Auburn Avenue.\n\nShe gingerly walked down the alley, leaning on her walker, and pointed.\n\nHere, she said, was where the tent she shared with her fiance once stood.\n\nThere, she said, was where Cornelius Taylor died last January, crushed inside their home when a front loader came to clear the homeless encampment.\n\nAbove the spot, a metal city sign said: \u201cIt is unlawful for any person to camp, store personal property or interfere with the flow of traffic on streets, sidewalks, and/or other right-of-way.\u201d Under the words, drawings of a tent and a bundle of clothes were slashed through.\n\nGriffeth, tall, with gray blooming in her cropped curls, moved slowly; a stroke three years ago had weakened her right side. Grief hung densely over her.\n\nOld Wheat Street itself is unremarkable now: two blocks long, empty save for parked cars, the clang of construction at one end and a new shiny housing complex rising over the alley. But in 1956, Auburn Avenue \u2013 which it runs parallel to \u2013 was dubbed \u201cthe richest Negro street in the world\u201d, home to Black-owned banks, newspapers and funeral homes until a highway cut it in two, an urban planning decision that decimated the flourishing Black community.\n\nOver a decade ago, a homeless encampment blossomed on the alley behind it, which eventually lined both of its sides with multicolored tents and was home to a rotating cast of more than two dozen people.\n\nToday, nothing is left. The encampment had been erased. Griffeth swatted at the late-August mosquitoes and slowly walked away.\n\nAt 9am on 16 January, a front loader weighing five tons rolled into the alley. Police, flanked by the department of public works and staff from the non-profit SafeHouse Outreach, followed close behind.\n\nThe city, citing complaints, had ordered the homeless encampment \u201cdecommissioned\u201d\u2013 just four days before Martin Luther King Jr Day celebrations less than a block away.\n\nWitnesses say the sweep felt rushed. A woman shouted at the front loader\u2019s driver as he rumbled down the alley from the east end. Just yards away stood Martin Luther King\u2019s birthplace and the white marble tombs of him and Coretta Scott King.\n\nThe front loader\u2019s bucket screeched against the pavement as it bore down on the first of four tents, red and white with a blue tarp draped across the back.\n\nCornelius was inside, unaware of what was unfolding. Only after people started screaming did the front loader stop moving forward \u2013 but it was too late.\n\nAt first, the police tried to claim in a report that Taylor was not badly injured, that he only had a \u201cbloody nose\u201d with no other \u201cobvious signs of physical hurt\u201d. Instead, they speculated that he had died of a drug overdose. But Taylor was already dead by the time an ambulance arrived.\n\nThe autopsy report, released 10 weeks later, found he died of blunt force trauma; his spleen and liver had been lacerated and his pelvis was cracked in half. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens and other city officials did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe street that was left behind was stained red. \u201cThe first image that comes to my mind is murder and blood,\u201d recalled Allen Hall, a former encampment resident and close friend of Taylor\u2019s.\n\nTim Franzen, who runs the Atlanta Economic Justice Program at American Friends Service Committee, arrived on the scene a few hours after it happened. Grimly, he said there was \u201ca lot of Cornelius\u201d left on the street. When Griffeth later looked through Taylor\u2019s belongings, she found pants with bits of his organs still in them.\n\nTaylor\u2019s death unfolded at the exact moment national policy shifted away even further from housing the homeless toward criminalization.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud) counted more homeless people last year than ever before \u2013 up 18% in just 12 months. Over a quarter of a million people now live entirely outdoors, a 7% jump from 2023.\n\nAs homelessness has increased, lawmakers across the country \u2013 from both parties \u2013 have turned their backs on efforts to find housing solutions. Instead, they picked up the criminalization playbook, focusing on making it illegal to sleep outside.\n\nThat has become the \u201cdominant\u201d approach, said Maria Foscarinis, founder of the National Homelessness Law Center. The forced clearing of encampments is a tool to enforce this worldview.\n\nLast year, the supreme court issued a decision that it is not cruel and unusual punishment to ban sleeping outside even if there are no indoor spaces available. The floodgates were opened, and more than 320 bills criminalizing homelessness were introduced across the country; nearly 220 have passed.\n\nThe phenomenon has taken root in Democratic and Republican communities alike. California had already turned to involuntary commitment for people living on the street; after the supreme court decision, Governor Gavin Newsom focused on forcing cities to clear homeless encampments. New York City, which at one time pledged to end veteran homelessness, conducted 2,300 encampment sweeps between January and September at a cost of $3.5m.\n\nNow Donald Trump\u2019s administration is taking things even further. In July, he signed an executive order calling to make it easier for states to clear homeless encampments and force people into drug and mental health treatment. It also called for cutting funding for housing first, an approach that prioritizes putting people in housing and then addressing other needs they may have. (Housing first has been proved to be the most effective approach to homelessness.)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the executive order that will help people,\u201d said Jesse Rabinowitz, who directs the Housing Not Handcuffs campaign. \u201cNo funding for housing, no funding for additional services. It will only make homelessness worse.\u201d\n\nIn August, Trump sent the national guard into Washington DC, in part to clear homeless camps.\n\nThese kinds of policies, and the focus on getting homeless people out of sight, are what homeless people in Atlanta and their allies say killed Taylor.\n\n\u201cThe way that I describe what killed him was not a guy driving a back loader,\u201d Franzen said. \u201cIt was years of bad policy that was driving that thing.\u201d\n\nI met Derek Chaney, Taylor\u2019s younger brother, by the basketball courts in DeKalb Memorial Park, in East Atlanta, on a humid summer morning.\n\nAn imposing man with a freckled nose and soft voice, he wore a shirt with Taylor\u2019s face and \u201cJustice for Cornelius Taylor\u201d written on it.\n\nGrowing up near the park, Derek shot hoops on its courts while his younger brother Taylor, inspired by action films, practiced karate he had taught himself; their mother couldn\u2019t afford classes.\n\nCatherine Chaney adopted Taylor as a baby from her niece, and as one of the first grandchildren he quickly became everyone\u2019s favorite. Family albums are filled with him in new outfits. Catherine, with help from her mother, raised Cornelius, Derek, and their sister Darlene while working full-time. \u201cEven if money got tight, we were always fed,\u201d Darlene said. \u201cWe were rich in love.\u201d\n\nTaylor was brilliant, skipping grades and helping his two younger siblings do their math homework. He also loved art, and drew so well that Darlene often thought he had traced the images. Derek thinks that, had he had opportunities to keep focusing on art, Taylor would have gravitated toward that instead of drugs.\n\nJust before eighth grade, Taylor visited his biological mother in the countryside, lured by the promise of a new bike that never materialized. She was on drugs, Darlene said, and made Taylor steal food for them. He said other things happened that were not right, but Darlene could not be sure what really occurred. \u201cHe had to grow up too fast and he saw things he\u2019d never seen before,\u201d Darlene said. After that visit, \u201cthings went haywire,\u201d she said. \u201cOne thing can change the trajectory of your entire life.\u201d\n\nShe watched as her older brothers\u2019 lives diverged. Derek got more into sports; Taylor started running with a different crowd. Derek graduated from a high school near Emory University. Taylor dropped out in 10th grade. That created tension with their mother, who insisted on the importance of education and wanted him to follow her rules, but \u201che just wanted to be his own man,\u201d Darlene said. He began spending stints of time out of their house, eventually landing in jail for low-level crimes like breaking into cars.\n\nHe began experiencing manic episodes, riding high on a wave of energy and then crashing into lows that made him angry and \u201cexplosive\u201d, Darlene said. He would speak so abrasively to their mother and grandmother he seemed like a completely different person. In his late teens, Taylor was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.\n\nAt 22, Taylor became a father and he and his girlfriend moved into their mother\u2019s house. But a year later, their mother died of cancer only months after the diagnosis.\n\nAfter that, Taylor\u2019s stretches of sleeping on the streets grew longer. \u201cShe was his anchor, and he lost his anchor,\u201d Darlene said. \u201cThat sent him over the edge.\u201d\n\nTaylor was born in 1978, just as America\u2019s modern homelessness crisis was taking shape.\n\nIn the 1970s, America still had a surplus of affordable housing. That ended under Reaganism, as deep spending cuts to public housing unfolded while cities demolished cheap housing stock.\n\nToday, only one in four eligible households actually get federal housing help, and the country is short 3.7m units.\n\nLaws that made it illegal to panhandle, sleep outside or even lie down on a sidewalk became more popular in the 1990s as mass homelessness took hold. It \u201cemerged as the quick fix response\u201d, said Foscarinis, the founder of the National Homelessness Law Center.\n\nAt the same time, encampments grew more common, particularly in the wake of the 2008 foreclosure crisis. \u201cPeople are homeless for longer periods of time, and that is more likely to lead to encampments,\u201d Foscarinis said. By one count, the number of camps nationwide grew 1,342% between 2007 and 2016.\n\nFor a time, housing the unhoused was a bipartisan priority. Efforts to address the problem were made by President George W Bush and continued with President Barack Obama, whose administration released the first federal plan to prevent and end homelessness. It set ambitious targets: ending chronic and veteran homelessness by 2015, and family and youth homelessness by 2020. Cities, including Atlanta, pledged to meet the federal goals and some even claimed victory.\n\n\u201cDuring those years, we never had to convince lawmakers to care about homelessness,\u201d said Marcy Thompson, vice-president of programs and policy at the National Alliance to End Homelessness, who worked at Hud under Bush and Obama. Even so, that era\u2019s promises were never coupled with enough money to turn them into a widespread reality.\n\nDuring the pandemic, emergency vouchers, eviction moratoria and putting homeless people in hotels pushed numbers down. But those lifelines ended, and Democrats\u2019 Build Back Better plan \u2013 which advocates say could have driven homelessness down to unprecedented lows \u2013 failed in Congress.\n\nSoon, housing prices \u2013 and general inflation \u2013 began to soar. Rent has risen 23% since 2001, while wages only grew 5%. The combination meant a lot more people ended up unhoused, including in places that had not experienced visible homelessness before. Donald Whitehead, the executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, said \u201cit put homelessness in the public view in a way that we hadn\u2019t seen it in a very long time.\u201d\n\nThe increase has overwhelmed local governments, who do not have the funding or housing stock to meet the need. In response, elected officials have searched for ways to \u201cmake homelessness less visible or to make the problem go away\u201d, Thompson said, so they turn to \u201cquick fixes\u201d.\n\nConservative thinktanks seized the moment. The Cicero Institute, created by venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale, pushed model laws in state and local governments to crack down on unsheltered homeless people. It even filed a brief in the supreme court case in favor of cities being allowed to criminalize encampments. (Georgia enacted a law in 2023 based on a Cicero template.) The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 went further, calling for the elimination of the \u201chousing first\u201d approach altogether.\n\nThese solutions are \u201ctempting\u201d, Thompson said, because it feels like something lawmakers can actually do. Creating enough affordable housing, on the other hand, is expensive and takes years.\n\nDarlene and Taylor drifted apart after their mother died. But when she returned to Atlanta after attending Howard University, they reconnected and stayed close. He called Darlene a few times a week and on every Sunday, without fail. He rarely had a phone of his own; Darlene picked up any number that called in case it was him. Even when he was living on the street, Darlene knew he would show up if she needed him.\n\nGriffeth had boyfriends on the street who beat her. Eight years ago, one of them slapped her so hard she blacked out. Taylor stepped in, pulled her back, and helped her recover. After that, she said, they shared a look that only the two of them understood. \u201cI looked at Psycho [his street name], he looked at me, and from then on, we always had that little look,\u201d she said.\n\nTaylor was her protector; Griffeth called him \u201cBear\u201d. He was funny and loved to laugh. \u201cIt came from the pit of his soul,\u201d Darlene said. \u201cHis smile just lit up the room.\u201d\n\nHall, Taylor\u2019s close friend, said Taylor always had a joke to tell. He had been \u201cin the trenches\u201d with him for most of his years of being unhoused, and they looked out for each other. Hall still wears a thick, metal bracelet and gold chain necklace that Taylor gave him. \u201cHe\u2019s like a biological brother to me. He\u2019s more family to me than my own biological family,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had a big heart.\u201d\n\nGus Hendricks, who lived on Old Wheat Street and was also Taylor\u2019s friend, saw the same thing. Although living on the streets made Taylor form an \u201couter shell\u201d that was \u201ckind of hard and thick\u201d. On the inside though, Hendricks said, he was \u201cvery caring\u201d.\n\nTaylor still loved making art; he made a big, colorful Thanksgiving sign for Remerge, a non-profit on Auburn Avenue that offers free coffee, food and activities for the unhoused, said Sylvia Broome, one of Remerge\u2019s volunteers. He rapped and freestyled. He probed Broome with deep questions about the Bible. One of the last conversations they had was trying to answer a question he posed: is it possible to be perfect as, the Bible says: \u201cBe perfect, therefore, as your heavenly father is perfect\u201d?\n\n\u201cIf Cornelius had help, they would have seen a very talented man that perhaps would have made a contribution for the betterment of society,\u201d Hall said.\n\nBut Taylor also continued to experience his manic highs, going days without sleep \u2013 as well as his lows, when he would suddenly be filled with rage and want to be left alone. There were times he couldn\u2019t \u201ccontain it\u201d, Hall said, and would start smashing windows and sidewalks with metal pipes. It\u2019s what gave him the street name Psycho.\n\n\u201cIt was crazy, but we loved each other,\u201d Griffeth said. \u201cIt was crazy love.\u201d\n\nTaylor had tried a few times over the years to get off the street and into housing, but it was never simple. He needed identification, but obtaining that and holding on to it, was a complicated task. Without showers and clean clothes, he struggled to get a job. And to maintain a job, he would need to stay on his medications, but he did not have regular access to a doctor.\n\nAt one point, Taylor got a spot in a large shelter, but residents had to leave early each morning and could not return until evening. Another room opened for him in Decatur, five miles (8km) from the downtown camp where his community lived, but it came with the same rigid hours \u2013 and Taylor feared being picked up by police for loitering if he lingered outside during the day.\n\nDarlene made it clear that when he was able to get clean, when he was really ready for a change, she would be there to help him and even house him. But she knew he had to be the one to decide to change his life.\n\nJust before his death, he seemed ready. Late last year, he met Derek\u2019s oldest daughter for the first time and promised her he would come to one of her basketball games when the season started. Darlene could tell he was taking his medications. He began to ask about his son more often. \u201cHe told me he wanted to be a better brother, wanted to be an uncle, wanted to be a dad, wanted to be present in all of this,\u201d Darlene said.\n\nGriffeth saw it too. Right before he died, the two of them had decided to finally get married. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to do it, but we were going to do it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe day before his death, he told Broome he had a line on a job. \u201cHe was just very optimistic and feeling good that day,\u201d she said. He told Darlene it was a job at a church \u2013 she thinks it was doing construction or working in a kitchen. Anything, he had said, to get the funds to move off the street. He wanted Darlene to help him manage his money. He was talking about getting his own place and decorating it.\n\nIt was different from what she had seen before, Darlene said. It seemed real this time. \u201cHe knew there was more life to live,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was trying to make the steps to come off of the streets. But I guess he couldn\u2019t get those steps fast enough.\u201d\n\nGriffeth was not in town on 16 January; she had left to try to secure housing for both of them. When she came back, someone on the street asked if she was Psycho\u2019s girlfriend. When she said she was, he replied: \u201cWell, you know, he got killed,\u201d she recalled.\n\nAt first she did not believe it. She thought it was a joke. But then she spoke to other people, who all confirmed the same thing: Taylor was dead.\n\nDarlene and Derek were celebrating Darlene\u2019s birthday in a cabin outside the city when, early the morning of 17 January, she looked at her phone and saw a voicemail. She read the transcription her phone had made and saw the words \u201cbrother\u201d and \u201cdead\u201d. It was Griffeth.\n\nFighting tears that rolled down his cheeks, Derek recalled how he called Griffeth over and over again until he finally reached her and she told him what she knew. The siblings searched the news and found stories about a homeless man who had been killed in an encampment clearing. \u201cI didn\u2019t get out of bed for a long time,\u201d Darlene said.\n\nFocusing first on getting people into homes and then helping them with other issues they may be experiencing, has been found to decrease homelessness by 88% compared to programs that insist on mental health or drug abuse treatment first. They are also more cost effective, producing benefits of $1.80 for every dollar spent.\n\nPushing people out of view and forcing them into treatment, however, is highly costly. Studies have found that they do not reduce homelessness, and even prolong it. Although the Trump administration is not keeping track of outcomes, local reports note many unhoused people are just being moved around by his crackdown, all at an estimated cost of $1m a day.\n\n\u201cWe could house several people for a year for that,\u201d Whitehead noted. \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of resources, it doesn\u2019t solve homelessness.\u201d\n\nAt first, Darlene was hopeful that her brother\u2019s death would lead to change. The Justice for Cornelius Taylor Coalition was created, and within days, the city halted all encampment clearings and banned the use of heavy equipment. The coalition secured a meeting with the mayor a week after Taylor\u2019s death.\n\nBut of the coalition\u2019s demands \u2013 a homeless \u201cczar\u201d in the mayor\u2019s administration, a housing-first approach, the firing of the person in charge of the non-profit that carries out the city\u2019s homelessness policy, and a taskforce convened to change city policy \u2013 the city only took them up on the taskforce. That taskforce was so resistant to wholescale change, Franzen said, that all of the coalition members eventually quit.\n\n\u201cOur premise for the taskforce was to change the city\u2019s approach to homelessness,\u201d Franzen said. \u201cThey just turned it into, \u2018Let\u2019s not crush a person.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s moratorium on clearings lapsed in early May. They started back up immediately. Atlanta mayor Andre Dickens has vowed to clear all encampments before the city hosts the World Cup next summer. Officials became anxious to finish what had begun in January and clear out the encampment on Old Wheat Street, but the Justice for Cornelius Taylor Coalition pushed back. It asked for 12 months; instead it got half that time. It demanded a year of housing and weekly groceries for 30 people with wraparound services including therapy and life skills coaching.\n\nThat is not what it got. In July, coalition volunteers gathered to pack up encampment residents and help them move to housing after weeks of meetings. Derek helped put residents\u2019 belongings into plastic bins and piled in a U-Haul van. Franzen secured a yellow school bus and cranked its air conditioning. Music played; every time an encampment resident chose to walk on to the bus, the entire crowd applauded. All the residents but one got on the bus and left. Loud cheers erupted as it drove away.\n\n\u201cIt was emotional,\u201d Derek said. \u201cIt was bittersweet.\u201d\n\nFranzen insists that the city promised there would be a bed for every person who said \u201cyes\u201d to getting on the bus. But when it arrived at Welcome House, a low-income housing complex squeezed between I-20 and a city jail, only 14 were available. A few residents who are veterans were supposed to get into veterans\u2019 housing, and a family with kids was supposed to go into family housing, none of which was ready either.\n\nThe encampment was torn down almost immediately after the bus left. Outreach workers ripped the doors of tents open, still filled with belongings \u2013 shampoo bottles, clothes, sunhats, mattresses, camping chairs, box fans, umbrellas, pillows \u2013 that they tore out with long metal poles. The tents were spray painted with a bubblegum pink \u201cX\u201d. The fire department carried around a black handheld screen called a thermal Flir to determine whether any heat signatures indicated bodies inside the tents \u2013 one way to avoid another death like Taylor\u2019s. Then the tents were pushed into a waiting dumptruck by a mini truck loader until the poles snapped and the structures were crushed.\n\n\u201cAfter that we know no one can go back into the tent,\u201d Maj Jeff Cantin, part of the Atlanta Police Hope Team, said in a video the city created.\n\nThe coalition was stuck: it could not return anyone to Old Wheat Street, but it had nowhere to house more than a dozen people. Franzen negotiated an extra room at Welcome House, and the city put the veterans and the family into a Motel 6. All the city offered the rest was spots in shelters, places where some had been previously sexually assaulted, and encampment residents said they would rather go back on the street than accept those. So coalition members scrambled to put them up in hotels, covering it out of their own pockets. They ended up paying for people to stay for three weeks at $100 a room per night.\n\nEventually, most people moved into Welcome House, the cost of which is covered by the city for a year, while the others have found other arrangements. One woman is at a Salvation Army waiting to be accepted into a job program that comes with an apartment. Two men who did not want to go to a sober living residence are staying with relatives, one in a car in a driveway.\n\nThe city\u2019s video claims everyone was moved to Welcome House and paired with a case manager, as well as given bedding, kitchenware and a food box. But the coalition has kept footing the bill to make sure those in Welcome House are fed, Franzen said. Darlene pulled blankets off of her own bed for them. They gathered TVs to put in everyone\u2019s room so residents had something to do during the day and gave everyone an air fryer so they could cook food in their rooms. They bring a truck full of food down twice a week.\n\nThe coalition released a petition in September claiming the city had failed to fund such services as mental health care, addiction treatment and employment assistance.\n\n\u201cI thought the loss of a man in such a gruesome manner would have gotten a bit of change started faster,\u201d Darlene said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound ungrateful, but there\u2019s more work to do.\u201d\n\nHall is more brutal in his assessment. \u201cCornelius\u2019s death opened the door for a lot of change,\u201d he said. But instead, \u201ca Band-Aid has been put on a wound.\u201d And now that his encampment is gone, they have stopped caring. \u201cAfter we was gone, the mayor disappeared, like David Copperfield.\u201d\n\nHall is among those who did not land at Welcome House. At first he was put up in one of the hotels. Now, after 31 years of living on the street, the slight 71-year-old with white in the whiskers around his lips has moved into a sober living apartment. He has gotten clean. He sits in his room drinking coffee and reading books. The peaceful back yard has trees and squirrels he enjoys.\n\n\u201cBeing in a house, I just try to sit and absorb it all, the reality of it,\u201d he said. He has a job lined up at a Popeyes and he is hoping that, with that income, he will be able to move to a place of his own and be completely self-sufficient. \u201cI want my own building key,\u201d he said.\n\nHe recognizes it is made possible by Taylor\u2019s death. \u201cI feel like his life was a sacrifice for us,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rooms inside Welcome House are small and frugal. Griffeth\u2019s has a sink on one side, a refrigerator and dresser on the other, and a twin bed along the third, \u201cand that\u2019s it\u201d. When she first walked in, she said, she thought to herself: \u201cThis is it?\u201d But just as quickly she was able to appreciate it. \u201cLook where I came from,\u201d she said. One of the best parts was access to a shower; she took three or four every day. Each floor of the building has bathrooms that lock behind the user and a shared kitchen. Griffeth has gained 25lbs since moving in. She wears the keys to her room around her neck on a blue lanyard everywhere she goes.\n\nFor her, it\u2019s temporary, a stepping stone to somewhere better. She wants to find her own home quickly if for no other reason than she needs somewhere to keep her papers: important documents, as well as every newspaper clipping about Taylor. \u201cI want to save everything,\u201d she said, her voice dropping to the hush that comes over her when she talks about him. She treasures the gifts he gave her, including two large African necklaces, a blue beaded bracelet and a silver ring she wears on her pinkie with some white and blue stones and a few empty settings. \u201cThis is the ring,\u201d she said softly. Even more quietly, she added: \u201cI\u2019m going to keep it for ever.\u201d\n\nHer grief is raw, gripping her in waves. But through it, she manages to find gratitude. Speaking in a barely audible whisper, she said: \u201cI really sometimes think that he died so I could live.\u201d"

We\u2019ve watched for weeks as Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin) and his cronies have treated Wendy (Sydney Chandler) and the other Lost Boys as toys, if not soulless tech experiments. Finally, in the Alien: Earth Season 1 finale, the tables turn\u2026\n\n**Spoilers for Alien: Earth Episode 8 \u201cThe Real Monsters,\u201d now streaming on Hulu**\n\nIn Alien: Earth Episode 8 \u201cThe Real Monsters,\u201d Wendy and the remaining Lost Boys \u2014 Nibs (Lily Newmark), Curly (Erana James), Slightly (Adarsh Gourav), and Smee (Jonathan Ajayi) \u2014 use their hybrid powers to wreck havoc on the remaining people in Neverland. They hunt down Prodigy\u2019s soldiers, capture Boy Kavalier, Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant), and Dame Sylvia (Essie Davis), and announce their plans to take over. The final moments of Alien: Earth Season 1 feature Wendy dressing Boy Kavalier down, pointing out that he\u2019s not Peter Pan. He\u2019s never even been a boy. Rather, he\u2019s always been a spiteful, miserable man.\n\nWith all of the grownups, except Wendy\u2019s beloved brother Hermit (Alex Lawther), tied up or killed, the question is\u2026what\u2019s next? With the Lost Boys behind her and the Xenomorphs at her beck and call, Wendy slyly answers, \u201cNow we rule.\u201d\n\nSo what does a world ruled by synthetic super beings with the brains of traumatized children look like? Is it a good thing? A bad thing? And what can we expect from that final twist involving dead scientist Arthur Sylvia (David Rysdahl) and the Eye Midge? Are there plans for an Alien: Earth Season 2? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the end of Alien: Earth\u2026\n\nAlien: Earth Ending Explained: \u201cNow We Rule\u201d\n\nAlien: Earth ends with Wendy and the Lost Boys rounding up all of the human, synthetic, and cyborg characters \u2014 the adults, if you will \u2014 and locking them in the same pen they start the episode trapped in. Wendy, leading the Lost Boys and controlling the Xenomorphs, wryly declares that now they\u2019re going to take over the world. \u201cNow we rule,\u201d she says, as Pearl Jam\u2019s \u201cAnimal\u201d plays.\n\nIs this a triumphant ending for Alien: Earth Season 1? Or a recipe for disaster in a potential Season 2?\n\n\u201cYou could watch it by saying, \u2018Well, damn right. These kids are going to take the Earth because adults are ruining it.\u2019\u201d Series showrunner Noah Hawley said. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s something empowering to that moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething about it made me think, like, I felt like I was in The Breakfast Club or something,\u201d Timothy Olyphant said. \u201cLike someone should walk off the campus and throw their fists in the air at the end.\u201d\n\nHawley added that there\u2019s also something worrying about the Lost Boys\u2019 victory. \u201cIt feels like running with scissors a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, maybe think this through a little bit before you just take off here.\u201d\n\nHawley revealed that the \u201ccentral question\u201d of Alien: Earth, to him, was whether or not Wendy and the hybrids would choose to be human or \u201cother.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause humanity is a choice now for them, right? They\u2019re not human anymore and in order to remain human, they have to actively choose to be human,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cBut as you see over the course of the season, Wendy says, \u2018If this is what people are, then I don\u2019t think I want to be people.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I think there\u2019s something a bit chilling, too, about this moment where you feel them rejecting humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate conundrum. Where do we go from here?\u201d Alex Lawther said, summing up the reticence we see on Hermit\u2019s face when he realizes what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cIs that anarchy? I\u2019m not sure because children aren\u2019t necessarily anarchists. They like power and authority. They like things being quite certain, don\u2019t they? They\u2019re not very nuanced in their thinking,\u201d Lawther said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the worrisome thing.\u201d\n\nSydney Chandler said she thought the ending set up a \u201cvery dangerous, beautiful scenario.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Wendy\u2019s ever thought about politics. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a politic-type girl,\u201d Sydney Chandler said. \u201cBut for Wendy, she\u2019s a black and white mind. You know, you\u2019re good or you\u2019re bad. And, don\u2019t be bad, because that\u2019s a very dangerous place to be.\u201d\n\nErana James said she felt \u201ca bit conflicted\u201d about what comes next. \u201cSeeing what these kids have gone through, these sort of horrors they\u2019ve endured, and the trauma throughout this season, I don\u2019t think I see them to be the best leaders going forward. However, on the other side of that coin, I don\u2019t think that the people in charge were either, so I think a shake-up is necessary.\u201d\n\nAdding to the chaos? A late episode reveal that the Eye Midge, the super-genius alien who spent most of the season in the body of a sheep, had now taken residence in Arthur Sylvia\u2019s corpse\u2026\n\nAlien: Earth Finale Reveals the Eye Midge\u2019s New Host\u2026David Rysdahl\u2019s Arthur Sylvia\n\nWere you surprised to watch the Eye Midge scuttle through the jungle and over the sand to take over the dead Arthur Sylvia\u2019s body in the Alien: Earth finale? So was actor David Rysdahl.\n\n\u201cI did not know what was gonna happen with the Eye Midge,\u201d Rysdahl said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us did. Maybe Noah did. You know, he\u2019s always thinking 3 steps down the line, but when I signed on, he told me Arthur\u2019s arc, and I was like, \u2018Okay, yeah, beautiful.\u2019\u201d\n\nRysdahl revealed that it wasn\u2019t until the day before the scripts for Alien: Earth Episode 8 were sent out that Hawley clued him in.\n\n\u201cHe texted me, he\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not done with you yet,\u2019\u201d Rysdahal said.\n\n\u201cI think if you can keep David Rysdahl on the show, you should keep David Rysdahl on the show,\u201d Noah Hawley told DECIDER, before calling the Eye Midge\u2019s choice of new host \u201copportunistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Eye Midge, I think, is a fascinating character,\u201d Rysdahl said. \u201cI think she\u2019s so intelligent, and then also has an absurdity to her. You know, she has jokes. She finds the world kind of funny and I think that is such a fun person to play with. Like, the genius who thinks it\u2019s all kind of crazy.\u201d\n\nRysdahl went on to imagine what a genius like the Eye Midge could do with Arthur Sylvia\u2019s \u201cvery smart\u201d brain and how her experience within the sheep could affect what comes next.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019d be funny if Arthur, like, baas halfway through, you know?\u201d Rysdahl said. \u201cIt kind of takes things with it as it\u2019s learning about the world and it\u2019s learning about it in a very organic way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I think I\u2019m going to let Noah guide that ship, but I\u2019m excited to \u2018yes, and\u2019 whatever he puts out in the world.\u201d\n\nWill There Be an Alien: Earth Season 2?\n\nAs of publication, FX hasn\u2019t yet revealed whether or not they\u2019re making a second season of Alien: Earth, but everyone DECIDER spoke with connected to the production is hopeful they\u2019ll get to continue the story.\n\n\u201cI have no idea where it goes next. You know, that\u2019s the beauty of hoping for Season 2 to see where Noah takes us,\u201d Sydney Chandler said.\n\nTimothy Olyphant said,\u201cNo matter where we end up, you know, I\u2019m showing up to work with Noah and showing up to work with this cast.\u201d\n\nOther actors said the reason they wanted to return was to explore a few loose threads.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Wendy and the Lost Boys have] come to terms with Tootles dying yet,\u201d Jonathan Ajayi said. \u201cTouch wood, hopefully we get a Season 2. I would love to really explore the fallout, the personal fallout of Tootles/Isaac not being there anymore.\u201d\n\nAnother thing Alien: Earth Season 2 might explore? If any of the other hybrids have special abilities similar to Wendy\u2019s abilities to control machines and chat with Xenomorphs.\n\n\u201cPart of the themes that we\u2019re exploring is like this technology race where no one\u2019s really taking the time they should take to figure out what could go wrong, right?\u201d Noah Hawley said, when asked about this potential.\n\n\u201cYou gotta walk a tightrope without making them too powerful on one level and then also not introducing things late in the game that feel convenient,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cLike, \u2018Oh, look, he can fly and that\u2019ll get them out of here!'\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026it seems like Nibs can fly already,\u201d Lily Newmark said. \u201cThere is that moment with Dame Sylvia. But if that\u2019s not a real thing, and I just managed to jump really far, then flying would be incredible. No need for spaceships in that case.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be able to float things with my mind,\u201d Ajayi said. \u201cDon\u2019t let Smee be able to move things with his mind, because it\u2019s chaos. I\u2019m telling you. Chaos.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Noah, if you\u2019re listening, please,\u201d he begged."

Simple green-on-black text, styled like a computer readout from the 80s, informs us that, in this broken future, corporations have taken over the universe, and which one achieves total domination will be determined by which of three technologies wins a \u201crace for immortality\u201d: cyborgs (enhanced humans), synths (wholly artificial beings) or hybrids (synthetic bodies with human consciousnesses implanted).\n\nThe last of these is our primary concern in a first episode that mostly consigns the flesh-ripping aliens to flash-forwards so rapid they are almost subliminal. In Neverland, the laboratory complex of trillion-dollar disruptive startup Prodigy, a girl who looks to be in the last stages of terminal cancer lies down next to an inert adult figure she names Wendy. When the procedure is over, her brain has been copied from her ailing body and pasted into the entirely lifelike synthetic woman. The newly alive Wendy (Sydney Chandler) is the first hybrid and, soon, the leader of a gang of child-robot soldiers mentored by the enigmatic Kirsh, played by Timothy Olyphant sporting harrowing bleach-blond hair, an unnerving murmur and a turtleneck sweater that says something really isn\u2019t right here.\n\nUp in space, meanwhile, a crew of humans have signed up for a job with big workers\u2019 rights issues. If being managed by a humourless cyborg named Morrow (Babou Ceesay) wasn\u2019t appalling enough, their cargo of captured alien life-forms are about to break out of the laughably weak glass containers they\u2019ve been stored in, kill everyone except the self-preserving Morrow, and cause the spaceship to crash as Morrow grimly tries to fulfil his obligation to the super-rich Weyland-Yutani Corporation by returning the bounty to Earth.\n\nAs the ship mingles with the rubble of the tall urban Earth building it has ploughed into and a Prodigy search-and-rescue (-and-steal-anything-valuable) team descends, led by Alex Lawther as listless medic (and Wendy\u2019s long-lost brother!) Hermit, the monsters are finally on the loose. The setup is loose compared with most of the Alien movies, since the human and humanoid protagonists aren\u2019t confined with the creatures in a tin box surrounded by an endless, scream-proof void, so Alien: Earth has to find other ways to create bone-deep dread.\n\nMost obviously we have the aliens, who aren\u2019t yet particularly innovative but are suitably awesome, from a scuttling, leechlike bug to an eyeball with many, many legs and a shiny xenomorph that comes over as a little more man-like than its previous incarnations. They\u2019re the classic nightmare fuel updated and sharpened and, when they strike, they leave behind the sort of oddly beautiful tableaux of torn corpses we haven\u2019t seen since Hannibal.\n\nEven better is the casting, with Lawther bringing the same blank resignation he lent to The End of the F***ing World, and Chandler offsetting it with a disturbing blend of naivety and concealed power. In an obvious allegory for the rise of AI, the hybrid Wendy has been given abilities beyond what even her creators understand. Most pleasing to see is Samuel Blenkin, rewarded for his fantastic supporting turn as the resentful weakling Prince Charles in Mary & George with the key role of Boy Kavalier, the \u201cgenius\u201d CEO of Prodigy and the Neverland project. With his comfy robes and puppyish, young-Wonka bounce, he is the frighteningly influential tech-bro pseudo-visionary who might bring the whole world crashing down, essentially just for a laugh: one of many nice touches in Blenkin\u2019s performance is the way the Boy takes a crucial video call by lying on a bed and gripping a tablet between his raised bare feet.\n\nWhat Alien: Earth lacks in its opening two instalments is a propulsive, linear narrative or clarity of thematic vision, to the point where it sometimes approaches Westworld levels of making us ask the gloomy screen what in the blazes is happening. But whether it\u2019s a padded corridor filmed at a 10-degree angle, a landscape of jagged concrete and raining sparks, a wriggling creepy-crawly from space or just the look in someone\u2019s jaded eye, the series always has a way of making us feel like helpless prey being circled. Something gloriously horrific is just around the corner."

                "text": "Alien: Earth Episode 8 \u201cThe Real Monsters\u201d wraps the FX show\u2019s first season with one heck of a regime change. We\u2019ve watched for weeks as Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin) and his cronies have treated Wendy (Sydney Chandler) and the other Lost Boys as toys, if not soulless tech experiments. Finally, in the Alien: Earth Season 1 finale, the tables turn\u2026\n\n**Spoilers for Alien: Earth Episode 8 \u201cThe Real Monsters,\u201d now streaming on Hulu**\n\nIn Alien: Earth Episode 8 \u201cThe Real Monsters,\u201d Wendy and the remaining Lost Boys \u2014 Nibs (Lily Newmark), Curly (Erana James), Slightly (Adarsh Gourav), and Smee (Jonathan Ajayi) \u2014 use their hybrid powers to wreck havoc on the remaining people in Neverland. They hunt down Prodigy\u2019s soldiers, capture Boy Kavalier, Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant), and Dame Sylvia (Essie Davis), and announce their plans to take over. The final moments of Alien: Earth Season 1 feature Wendy dressing Boy Kavalier down, pointing out that he\u2019s not Peter Pan. He\u2019s never even been a boy. Rather, he\u2019s always been a spiteful, miserable man.\n\nWith all of the grownups, except Wendy\u2019s beloved brother Hermit (Alex Lawther), tied up or killed, the question is\u2026what\u2019s next? With the Lost Boys behind her and the Xenomorphs at her beck and call, Wendy slyly answers, \u201cNow we rule.\u201d\n\nSo what does a world ruled by synthetic super beings with the brains of traumatized children look like? Is it a good thing? A bad thing? And what can we expect from that final twist involving dead scientist Arthur Sylvia (David Rysdahl) and the Eye Midge? Are there plans for an Alien: Earth Season 2? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the end of Alien: Earth\u2026\n\nAlien: Earth Ending Explained: \u201cNow We Rule\u201d\n\nAlien: Earth ends with Wendy and the Lost Boys rounding up all of the human, synthetic, and cyborg characters \u2014 the adults, if you will \u2014 and locking them in the same pen they start the episode trapped in. Wendy, leading the Lost Boys and controlling the Xenomorphs, wryly declares that now they\u2019re going to take over the world. \u201cNow we rule,\u201d she says, as Pearl Jam\u2019s \u201cAnimal\u201d plays.\n\nIs this a triumphant ending for Alien: Earth Season 1? Or a recipe for disaster in a potential Season 2?\n\n\u201cYou could watch it by saying, \u2018Well, damn right. These kids are going to take the Earth because adults are ruining it.\u2019\u201d Series showrunner Noah Hawley said. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s something empowering to that moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething about it made me think, like, I felt like I was in The Breakfast Club or something,\u201d Timothy Olyphant said. \u201cLike someone should walk off the campus and throw their fists in the air at the end.\u201d\n\nHawley added that there\u2019s also something worrying about the Lost Boys\u2019 victory. \u201cIt feels like running with scissors a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, maybe think this through a little bit before you just take off here.\u201d\n\nHawley revealed that the \u201ccentral question\u201d of Alien: Earth, to him, was whether or not Wendy and the hybrids would choose to be human or \u201cother.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause humanity is a choice now for them, right? They\u2019re not human anymore and in order to remain human, they have to actively choose to be human,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cBut as you see over the course of the season, Wendy says, \u2018If this is what people are, then I don\u2019t think I want to be people.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I think there\u2019s something a bit chilling, too, about this moment where you feel them rejecting humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate conundrum. Where do we go from here?\u201d Alex Lawther said, summing up the reticence we see on Hermit\u2019s face when he realizes what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cIs that anarchy? I\u2019m not sure because children aren\u2019t necessarily anarchists. They like power and authority. They like things being quite certain, don\u2019t they? They\u2019re not very nuanced in their thinking,\u201d Lawther said. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the worrisome thing.\u201d\n\nSydney Chandler said she thought the ending set up a \u201cvery dangerous, beautiful scenario.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Wendy\u2019s ever thought about politics. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a politic-type girl,\u201d Sydney Chandler said. \u201cBut for Wendy, she\u2019s a black and white mind. You know, you\u2019re good or you\u2019re bad. And, don\u2019t be bad, because that\u2019s a very dangerous place to be.\u201d\n\nErana James said she felt \u201ca bit conflicted\u201d about what comes next. \u201cSeeing what these kids have gone through, these sort of horrors they\u2019ve endured, and the trauma throughout this season, I don\u2019t think I see them to be the best leaders going forward. However, on the other side of that coin, I don\u2019t think that the people in charge were either, so I think a shake-up is necessary.\u201d\n\nAdding to the chaos? A late episode reveal that the Eye Midge, the super-genius alien who spent most of the season in the body of a sheep, had now taken residence in Arthur Sylvia\u2019s corpse\u2026\n\nAlien: Earth Finale Reveals the Eye Midge\u2019s New Host\u2026David Rysdahl\u2019s Arthur Sylvia\n\nWere you surprised to watch the Eye Midge scuttle through the jungle and over the sand to take over the dead Arthur Sylvia\u2019s body in the Alien: Earth finale? So was actor David Rysdahl.\n\n\u201cI did not know what was gonna happen with the Eye Midge,\u201d Rysdahl said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us did. Maybe Noah did. You know, he\u2019s always thinking 3 steps down the line, but when I signed on, he told me Arthur\u2019s arc, and I was like, \u2018Okay, yeah, beautiful.\u2019\u201d\n\nRysdahl revealed that it wasn\u2019t until the day before the scripts for Alien: Earth Episode 8 were sent out that Hawley clued him in.\n\n\u201cHe texted me, he\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not done with you yet,\u2019\u201d Rysdahal said.\n\n\u201cI think if you can keep David Rysdahl on the show, you should keep David Rysdahl on the show,\u201d Noah Hawley told DECIDER, before calling the Eye Midge\u2019s choice of new host \u201copportunistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Eye Midge, I think, is a fascinating character,\u201d Rysdahl said. \u201cI think she\u2019s so intelligent, and then also has an absurdity to her. You know, she has jokes. She finds the world kind of funny and I think that is such a fun person to play with. Like, the genius who thinks it\u2019s all kind of crazy.\u201d\n\nRysdahl went on to imagine what a genius like the Eye Midge could do with Arthur Sylvia\u2019s \u201cvery smart\u201d brain and how her experience within the sheep could affect what comes next.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019d be funny if Arthur, like, baas halfway through, you know?\u201d Rysdahl said. \u201cIt kind of takes things with it as it\u2019s learning about the world and it\u2019s learning about it in a very organic way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I think I\u2019m going to let Noah guide that ship, but I\u2019m excited to \u2018yes, and\u2019 whatever he puts out in the world.\u201d\n\nWill There Be an Alien: Earth Season 2?\n\nAs of publication, FX hasn\u2019t yet revealed whether or not they\u2019re making a second season of Alien: Earth, but everyone DECIDER spoke with connected to the production is hopeful they\u2019ll get to continue the story.\n\n\u201cI have no idea where it goes next. You know, that\u2019s the beauty of hoping for Season 2 to see where Noah takes us,\u201d Sydney Chandler said.\n\nTimothy Olyphant said,\u201cNo matter where we end up, you know, I\u2019m showing up to work with Noah and showing up to work with this cast.\u201d\n\nOther actors said the reason they wanted to return was to explore a few loose threads.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Wendy and the Lost Boys have] come to terms with Tootles dying yet,\u201d Jonathan Ajayi said. \u201cTouch wood, hopefully we get a Season 2. I would love to really explore the fallout, the personal fallout of Tootles/Isaac not being there anymore.\u201d\n\nAnother thing Alien: Earth Season 2 might explore? If any of the other hybrids have special abilities similar to Wendy\u2019s abilities to control machines and chat with Xenomorphs.\n\n\u201cPart of the themes that we\u2019re exploring is like this technology race where no one\u2019s really taking the time they should take to figure out what could go wrong, right?\u201d Noah Hawley said, when asked about this potential.\n\n\u201cYou gotta walk a tightrope without making them too powerful on one level and then also not introducing things late in the game that feel convenient,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cLike, \u2018Oh, look, he can fly and that\u2019ll get them out of here!'\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026it seems like Nibs can fly already,\u201d Lily Newmark said. \u201cThere is that moment with Dame Sylvia. But if that\u2019s not a real thing, and I just managed to jump really far, then flying would be incredible. No need for spaceships in that case.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be able to float things with my mind,\u201d Ajayi said. \u201cDon\u2019t let Smee be able to move things with his mind, because it\u2019s chaos. I\u2019m telling you. Chaos.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Noah, if you\u2019re listening, please,\u201d he begged."

But on the other side, the injury bug caught up with some franchises \u2013 the San Francisco 49ers lost star pass rusher Nick Bosa to a season-ending torn ACL, while Arizona Cardinals running back James Connor suffered a foot injury which rules him out for the remainer of 2025.\n\nHere are the three main takeaways from Week 3.\n\nThree-way race for NFL MVP?\n\nThree weeks into the NFL season is typically too early to make grand proclamations about who the favorites are to win the NFL Most Valuable Player award.\n\nBut we\u2019re going to do it anyway.\n\nQuarterbacks are often the front-runners to win the award and this year looks no different with three stellar candidates leading the race so far.\n\nTwo are previous winners \u2013 Baltimore Ravens\u2019 Lamar Jackson and Buffalo Bills\u2019 Josh Allen \u2013 and one is a newcomer to this stage \u2013 Justin Herbert of the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nJackson, a two-time winner of the award, has continued to show why he\u2019s one of the most difficult players to game-plan against for opposing defenses, with his running ability making him almost impossible to catch and his throwing accuracy consistently improving.\n\nWhile Jackson entered the NFL as a raw prospect with obvious physical gifts, the 28-year-old has developed into one of the most accomplished pocket passers and once again looks set for another monster season.\n\n2024 NFL MVP Allen has also begun the season well, leading the Bills to a 3-0 start behind some almost perfect performances.\n\nAllen has thrown five passing touchdowns, run in two more and has had zero giveaways through the first three weeks. He\u2019s benefited from a thriving running game too, with Buffalo back James Cook wracking up 284 yards on the ground and four scores.\n\nBut Allen and Jackson will have to go against Chargers quarterback Herbert if they want to add another MVP trophy to their list of accolades.\n\nThe sixth-year quarterback is thriving during head coach Jim Harbaugh\u2019s second season in Los Angeles and, despite many thinking the team would become a run-orientated outfit, the opposite has in fact happened.\n\nThe Chargers are relying on Herbert\u2019s ability with the ball in his hands, and the quarterback has already thrown for 860 yards and six touchdowns across the team\u2019s three season-opening wins.\n\nAnd from the eye test, Herbert looks the real deal too.\n\nHe once again showed why he\u2019s a unique talent late in the Week 3 victory against the Denver Broncos. The 27-year-old somehow escaped a sack, scrambled to his left and \u2013 with a defender in his face \u2013 managed to produce a brilliant throw to find Keenan Allen in the endzone to tie the game. On the next possession, he orchestrated a time-sapping drive to set up the Chargers\u2019 game-winning field goal.\n\nHarbaugh\u2019s empowering of his quarterback is clearly having the desired effect, and Herbert\u2019s success through the first three weeks has him in a strong position to challenge for his first MVP award, should it continue.\n\nCaleb Williams shows he\u2019s the real deal \u2026 finally\n\nCaleb Williams\u2019 rookie year with the Chicago Bears was a rough one, punctuated with an almost record level of sacks, offensive woes and a head coach firing.\n\nAnd his second year, now with first-year head coach Ben Johnson at the helm, didn\u2019t start much better with two tough outings to open the season.\n\nBut in Week 3, the 2024 No. 1 overall pick out of USC showed why he\u2019s long been touted as a star in the league.\n\nWilliams threw for 298 yards and four touchdowns, including a beautiful 65-yard bomb down the left sideline to Luther Burden, in a big win over the Dallas Cowboys and his former Bears head coach Matt Eberflus, now the defensive coordinator of the Cowboys.\n\nThat pass to Burden was the exclamation point on arguably the best performances of Williams\u2019 young NFL career, and one which left NFL legend Tom Brady \u2013 who was covering the game for Fox \u2013 in awe.\n\n\u201cOH. MY. GOD!\u201d Brady exclaimed, before adding: \u201cCaleb, man in his face and absolutely unleashes a dot all the way downfield. Incredible.\u201d\n\nThe addition of Johnson as head coach of the Bears was meant to galvanize Williams and the Chicago offense after years of success in Detroit as the Lions\u2019 offensive coordinator.\n\nBut through the first two weeks, that offensive transformation has yet to be seen, with Williams and his cohort of offensive weapons struggling to get on track.\n\nThat changed on Sunday, though, when it all came together perfectly, largely because of an almost perfect game from Williams.\n\nNext crop of stars in Cleveland?\n\nArguably the result of Week 3 came in Cleveland, where the Browns scored 10 points in the final three minutes to defeat the previously-unbeaten Green Bay Packers 13-10.\n\nIt was the Browns\u2019 first win of the season and came courtesy of the promising set of rookies they selected in April\u2019s NFL Draft.\n\nWhile the passing offense struggled against a loaded Packers defense, Cleveland\u2019s running game performed admirably, mainly through rookie Quinshon Judkins, who was drafted in second round out of Ohio State.\n\nIn just his second appearance in the NFL, Judkins ran for 94 yards on 18 attempts, including a touchdown, averaging 5.2 yards per carry.\n\nFor a team who let veteran Nick Chubb leave in the offseason, Judkins\u2019 emergence comes at a timely moment. And with fellow rookie Dylan Sampson at the position, it could offer production at running back going forward.\n\nElsewhere on offense, first-year tight end Harold Fannin Jr. continued to display why he is rated so highly. Fannin Jr. had three catches for 25 yards and offers a perfect foil for fellow tight end David Njoku.\n\nAnd Cleveland\u2019s rookies on defense also showed up against Green Bay.\n\nLinebacker Carson Schwesinger \u2013 drafted in the second round out of UCLA \u2013 continued his monster start to life in the NFL, flying round the field and popping up wherever the Packers tried to move the ball.\n\nSchwesinger finished with nine tackles and one sack.\n\nMason Graham, the no. 5 overall pick in the 2025 Draft, also had an impact, with the defensive tackle wracking up three tackles and 0.5 sacks. Undrafted defensive end Adin Huntington also had half a sack.\n\nEven with all those rookies playing a part, the Browns could have more to come as the season develops from the quarterback position having drafted Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders in the third and fifth rounds respectively.\n\nFor a team predicted to be one of the worst in the league this season, the Browns\u2019 crop of first-year players will offer signs of optimism for the rest of the year.\n\nFull Week 3 scores\n\n(Home vs. away, winners in bold)\n\nBuffalo Bills 31-21 Miami Dolphins\n\nCarolina Panthers 30-0 Atlanta Falcons\n\nCleveland Browns 13-10 Green Bay Packers\n\nJacksonville Jaguars 17-10 Houston Texans\n\nMinnesota Vikings 48-10 Cincinnati Bengals\n\nNew England Patriots 14-21 Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles 33-26 Los Angeles Rams\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers 29-27 New York Jets\n\nTennessee Titans 20-41 Indianapolis Colts\n\nWashington Commanders 41-24 Las Vegas Raiders\n\nLos Angeles Chargers 23-20 Denver Broncos\n\nSeattle Seahawks 44-13 New Orleans Saints\n\nChicago Bears 31-14 Dallas Cowboys\n\nSan Francisco 49ers 16-15 Arizona Cardinals\n\nNew York Giants 9-22 Kansas City Chiefs"

A failed two-point conversion and a failed onside kick later, the Lions could kneel out the clock.\n\nIt was a jarring sight to see the Ravens (1-2) pushed around on their home field, where they lost for only the fourth time in 26 primetime games under coach John Harbaugh. When Gibbs and Montgomery weren\u2019t running through the Baltimore defense, Goff had plenty of time to pick the Ravens apart as Detroit methodically advanced down the field. Goff completed 20 of 28 passes for 202 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\u201cWe did exactly what we wanted to do, sustained long drives,\u201d said Goff of his offense.\n\nWith the score tied at 21-21, the Lions faced fourth-and-one from the Baltimore four-yard line on the first play of the fourth quarter. St Brown took the ball on what initially looked like a jet sweep, then pitched it back to Gibbs, who scored easily.\n\nAfter a field goal made it 28-24, the Ravens got a defensive stop, but Derrick Henry lost a fumble in a huge fourth-quarter spot for the second time in three weeks, giving Detroit the ball at the Baltimore 16. Still, the Lions couldn\u2019t put the game away, settling for a field goal when that drive was derailed by a facemask penalty on Christian Mahogany. But the Ravens couldn\u2019t move the ball and punted on fourth-and-nine. Then Montgomery made it a 14-point game.\n\nHenry said he had apologized to his team for his fumble. \u201cIt\u2019s just crazy,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThree fumbles [in three games] straight. I\u2019m trying every day to fix the problem that just keeps occurring. I\u2019m my worst critic, so I\u2019m not going to try to beat myself up too much. But it\u2019s hard not to when it\u2019s consecutive and consistent [examples] of me doing the same thing.\u201d\n\nThe game started as advertised, with the Lions \u2013 fresh off a 52-point performance against Chicago \u2013 breezing down the field for an early 7-0 lead on a one-yard run by Gibbs. Then the Ravens \u2013 who reached 40 points in each of their first two games \u2014 quickly tied it on a 28-yard touchdown run by Henry."

                "article_summary": "In Week 3 of the NFL season, five teams were without their starting quarterbacks, but some managed to secure victories, including the Eagles, Bills, and 49ers. The Power Rankings highlighted the confidence levels in each team's quarterback situation as they approach Week 4, with the Eagles and Bills showing particularly high confidence in Jalen Hurts and Josh Allen, respectively. Meanwhile, several teams, such as the Dolphins and Saints, are struggling with their quarterback play, leading to concerns about their future performance.",

                "text": "Editor\u2019s note: This article is part of The Athletic NFL Power Rankings. Every\u200b week, Chad Graff and Josh Kendall rank and analyze all 32 teams from first to worst.\n\nIt was only Week 3, and already five teams were without their starting quarterback. For three of them, it hardly mattered. Mac Jones and the San Francisco 49ers beat the Arizona Cardinals, Marcus Mariota and the Washington Commanders beat the Las Vegas Raiders, and Carson Wentz and the Minnesota Vikings beat Jake Browning and the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nStill, questions remain for those teams and others at the sport\u2019s most important position. So this week, the Power Rankings will be gauging how confident each team should be in its quarterback situation looking ahead to Week 4.\n\n1. Philadelphia Eagles (3-0)\n\nLast week: 2\n\nSunday: Beat Rams 33-26\n\nQB confidence: Cold-blooded confidence\n\nAs 336-pound Jordan Davis rumbled his way into the end zone on the game\u2019s final play and the Eagles sideline bounced with excitement, Jalen Hurts watched without reaction. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you might\u2019ve thought the Eagles just lost in painful fashion. But Hurts is now 17-0 in the last 17 games he started and finished. The guy just wins.\n\nUp next: at Buccaneers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n2. Buffalo Bills (3-0)\n\nLast week: 3\n\nThursday: Beat Dolphins 31-21\n\nQB confidence: Could it be any higher?\n\nJosh Allen is the defending MVP. He\u2019s already up to seven touchdowns (five passing, two rushing) and 869 total yards. He\u2019s as good as there is right now. There\u2019s nothing left for him to prove in the regular season.\n\nUp next: vs. Saints, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n3. Los Angeles Chargers (3-0)\n\nLast week: 4\n\nSunday: Beat Broncos 23-20\n\nQB confidence: Skyrocketing\n\nIn Year 6, Justin Herbert is living up to the massive expectations that have long surrounded him. He leads the NFL with 860 passing yards to go with six touchdowns and one interception. His strong start has him as the player with the third-best odds to be named MVP, per BetMGM.\n\nUp next: at Giants, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n4. San Francisco 49ers (3-0)\n\nLast week: 9\n\nSunday: Beat Cardinals 16-15\n\nQB confidence: Fine if healthy\n\nMac Jones re-aggravated a PCL strain Sunday while leading the Niners to a second win with him under center. Meanwhile, starter Brock Purdy has been out with a toe injury. But even while changing quarterbacks and playing without receivers Brandon Aiyuk and Jauan Jennings, the 49ers keep rolling along, taking advantage of an easy early schedule.\n\nUp next: vs. Jaguars, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET\n\n5. Detroit Lions (2-1)\n\nLast week: 6\n\nMonday: Beat Ravens 38-30\n\nQB confidence: Ben Johnson, who?\n\nAfter some Week 1 rust, Jared Goff and the Lions offense are back to the aggressiveness and fun play calling that were so successful under Johnson. Goff benefited from a strong running game Monday night but played well, including a perfect pass to Amon-Ra St. Brown late on fourth-and-2. The last two weeks feel like a statement that they\u2019ll be fine after losing their two coordinators from last season.\n\nUp next: vs. Browns, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n6. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (3-0)\n\nLast week: 8\n\nSunday: Beat Jets 29-27\n\nQB confidence: Full of swagger\n\nBaker Mayfield has brought confidence to the Bucs, even if there are signs it may not be sustainable. The Bucs were tied or losing with 90 seconds left in all three games this season. No NFL team has ever started 3-0 with a lower point differential than Tampa Bay\u2019s plus-6. No matter. Mayfield\u2019s confidence is rubbing off on his teammates.\n\nUp next: vs. Eagles, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n7. Green Bay Packers (2-1)\n\nLast week: 1\n\nSunday: Lost to Browns 13-10\n\nQB confidence: Great (when Jim Schwartz isn\u2019t around)\n\nA matchup against Schwartz and the Browns defense eventually thwarted Jordan Love\u2019s efficient start. But even while often flummoxed, Love drove the Packers into field goal range Sunday before a block set up Cleveland\u2019s game winner in the biggest upset of Week 3. Still, Love will be fine. Nothing to see here.\n\nUp next: at Cowboys, Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET\n\n8. Indianapolis Colts (3-0)\n\nLast week: 10\n\nSunday: Beat Titans 41-20\n\nQB confidence: Is Daniel Jones the new Sam Darnold?\n\nA year ago, Darnold got his career back on solid footing with an impressive campaign no one saw coming. Maybe it\u2019s Jones\u2019 turn. Everyone waiting for Jones (and the Colts) to implode will have to wait another week. Jones leads the NFL in yards per pass attempt.\n\nUp next: at Rams, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET\n\n9. Los Angeles Rams (2-1)\n\nLast week: 7\n\nSunday: Lost to Eagles 33-26\n\nQB confidence: High (if Stafford\u2019s back is OK)\n\nAfter Matthew Stafford missed some of training camp with an aggravated disc in his back, the quarterback hasn\u2019t appeared on the injury report through three weeks and is playing well. If the 37-year-old stays healthy, the Rams will be a tough out in the NFC.\n\nUp next: vs. Colts, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET\n\n10. Baltimore Ravens (1-2)\n\nLast week: 5\n\nMonday: Lost to Lions 38-30\n\nQB confidence: High, of course, but is there enough help?\n\nLamar Jackson was predictably very good on Monday night. But the O-line struggled, Derrick Henry lost another key fourth-quarter fumble and the receivers didn\u2019t do much to help. The seven sacks Jackson took tied for the most he\u2019s taken in a game during his eight-year NFL career.\n\nUp next: at Chiefs, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET\n\n11. Washington Commanders (2-1)\n\nLast week: 11\n\nSunday: Beat Raiders 41-24\n\nQB confidence: Just let Jayden Daniels get healthy\n\nWashington fans don\u2019t need any flashbacks to a quarterback suffering a reinjury after a promising rookie season. While Daniels missed Sunday\u2019s game, Marcus Mariota was surprisingly efficient \u2014 though it helps when you also get a 90-yard punt return and a 60-yard rush. Still, Mariota did everything asked of him and should be fine if he\u2019s needed to start again this week against a reeling Atlanta team.\n\nUp next: at Falcons, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n12. Kansas City Chiefs (1-2)\n\nLast week: 13\n\nSunday: Beat Giants 22-9\n\nQB confidence: Just waiting on reinforcements\n\nSomehow, Patrick Mahomes has made Tyquan Thornton look like a legit NFL receiver after he was cast off by the Patriots as a second-round bust. If he can do that with Thornton, this offense should be fine once Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy are back.\n\nUp next: vs. Ravens, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET\n\n13. Seattle Seahawks (2-1)\n\nLast week: 15\n\nSunday: Beat Saints 44-13\n\nQB confidence: Cautiously optimistic\n\nQuietly, Sam Darnold ranks third in the NFL in yards per pass, sixth in completion percentage and second in success rate. He has the Seahawks offense moving along nicely and seems to be fitting well with new offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak.\n\nUp next: at Cardinals, Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET\n\n14. Minnesota Vikings (2-1)\n\nLast week: 22\n\nSunday: Beat Bengals 48-10\n\nQB confidence: Does it matter?\n\nKevin O\u2019Connell picked up Carson Wentz four weeks ago, and even with limited practice reps and basically no training camp, Wentz guided the Vikings to a blowout win while throwing for two touchdowns and averaging 8.7 yards per pass. At this point, it would be fun to see which quarterback you could drop onto this roster with O\u2019Connell and still win a game.\n\nUp next: at Steelers (in Dublin), Sunday, 9:30 a.m. ET\n\n15. Pittsburgh Steelers (2-1)\n\nLast week: 17\n\nSunday: Beat Patriots 21-14\n\nQB confidence: It\u2019s a lot to ask \u2026 but it\u2019s working\n\nThe Steelers have no running game, and again, they couldn\u2019t get that phase of the offense working even against a struggling Patriots defense. So Aaron Rodgers casually threw a pair of touchdown passes on a day the unit was mostly stagnant.\n\nUp next: vs. Vikings (in Dublin), Sunday, 9:30 a.m. ET\n\n16. Jacksonville Jaguars (2-1)\n\nLast week: 19\n\nSunday: Beat Texans 17-10\n\nQB confidence: Alarm bells are starting to go off\n\nThis is Trevor Lawrence\u2019s fifth NFL season, and we keep waiting for a breakout that once felt inevitable. But the switch to Liam Coen as head coach hasn\u2019t come with the positive shift in Lawrence many expected. It\u2019s still early, but this season, Lawrence has completed just 58.8 percent of his passes (30th in the NFL) for 5.9 yards per attempt (25th) and has thrown as many touchdowns (four) as interceptions.\n\nUp next: at 49ers, Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET\n\n17. Denver Broncos (1-2)\n\nLast week: 14\n\nSunday: Lost to Chargers 23-20\n\nQB confidence: Is this a slump, or is it just who he is?\n\nThe promise of Bo Nix\u2019s rookie season has so far yielded a dud in Year 2. He had a pair of costly overthrows on Sunday and has struggled against pressure. He\u2019s both throwing short (25th in air yards per throw) and for little yardage (26th in yards per attempt). This wasn\u2019t how things were supposed to look in his sophomore season.\n\nUp next: vs. Bengals, Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET\n\n18. Chicago Bears (1-2)\n\nLast week: 25\n\nSunday: Beat Cowboys 31-14\n\nQB confidence: Dare we say \u2026 high?\n\nAfter the struggles of the first two weeks, Caleb Williams thrived Sunday in Ben Johnson\u2019s offense. It was the best game of his short career as he threw for 298 yards and four touchdowns. His deep ball could open things up for this offense, and suddenly there\u2019s some well-deserved confidence in the Williams/Johnson pairing.\n\nUp next: at Raiders, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET\n\n19. Arizona Cardinals (2-1)\n\nLast week: 18\n\nSunday: Lost to 49ers 16-15\n\nQB confidence: He is what he is\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s hard to imagine Arizona will get any more out of Kyler Murray. He\u2019s a fine, middle-of-the-road quarterback who can make dazzling plays with his legs but just isn\u2019t reliable enough to become a top-10 guy. Fittingly, he ranks 15th this season in success rate and 18th in adjusted yards per attempt. Right in the middle of the pack.\n\nUp next: vs. Seahawks, Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET\n\n20. Cleveland Browns (1-2)\n\nLast week: 27\n\nSunday: Beat Packers 13-10\n\nQB confidence: Can there be any?\n\nJoe Flacco was booed at home in the second half en route to a 21-of-36 passing performance for 142 yards, no touchdowns and an interception. The Browns defense helped them secure an impressive win, but if Flacco plays like that much longer, it\u2019ll be time to turn to one of the rookies.\n\nUp next: at Lions, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n21. Carolina Panthers (1-2)\n\nLast week: 31\n\nSunday: Beat Falcons 30-0\n\nQB confidence: Rising concern\n\nIf only Bryce Young could always play against the Falcons. He\u2019s 7-24 as an NFL starter but 3-1 against the Falcons. The Panthers nabbed a big win, but Young\u2019s hot streak from the end of last season appears to be over. He ranks 29th (among 31 qualifying quarterbacks) in adjusted yards per attempt.\n\nUp next: at Patriots, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n22. Dallas Cowboys (1-2)\n\nLast week: 21\n\nSunday: Lost to Bears 31-14\n\nQB confidence: At least the \u201cAll-22\u201d looks cool\n\nNo quarterback has thrown more big-time passes, per PFF, than Dak Prescott (11). But it hasn\u2019t mattered because Prescott also ranks 19th in yards per attempt (6.3). And the task doesn\u2019t get any easier for Dallas this week.\n\nUp next: vs. Packers, Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET\n\n23. Atlanta Falcons (1-2)\n\nLast week: 16\n\nSunday: Lost to Panthers 30-0\n\nQB confidence: Inexplicably high\n\nThe Falcons will tell you they\u2019re super excited about Michael Penix. But so far, there\u2019s been little rationale to back up that belief this season. Penix was pulled for Kirk Cousins late in Sunday\u2019s blowout loss and ranks 35th among 36 quarterbacks in PFF\u2019s passing grade (ahead of only Nix).\n\nUp next: vs. Commanders, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n24. Cincinnati Bengals (2-1)\n\nLast week: 12\n\nSunday: Lost to Vikings 48-10\n\nQB confidence: Totally free-falling\n\nJake Browning threw as many touchdown passes to the Vikings as he did to his teammates in a game that totally got away from Cincy. Another clunker like that, and the Bengals might be better off looking elsewhere (Kirk Cousins?). But would their ownership spend big on a temporary QB?\n\nUp next: at Broncos, Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET\n\n25. Las Vegas Raiders (1-2)\n\nLast week: 20\n\nSunday: Lost to Commanders 41-24\n\nQB confidence: He\u2019s not why they\u2019re losing\n\nGeno Smith has brought what the Raiders were looking for and solidified that position. He ranks seventh in the league in yards per attempt and threw three touchdowns without any interceptions Sunday. But the Raiders haven\u2019t been able to get the running game going with rookie Ashton Jeanty.\n\nUp next: vs. Bears, Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET\n\n26. New England Patriots (1-2)\n\nLast week: 23\n\nSunday: Lost to Steelers 21-14\n\nQB confidence: A rare bright spot\n\nNot much has gone as planned for the Patriots. The running backs can\u2019t hang on to the ball. The receivers can\u2019t get open. The defense hasn\u2019t been as good as expected. But through three games, Maye has taken a step forward, ranking fifth in the NFL in completion percentage over expected and eighth in expected points added per play.\n\nUp next: vs. Panthers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n27. Houston Texans (0-3)\n\nLast week: 24\n\nSunday: Lost to Jaguars 17-10\n\nQB confidence: Time for the panic button\n\nC.J. Stroud\u2019s 2024 season was dismissed as a sophomore slump after an incredible rookie season. But now those issues have lingered into Year 3, and it\u2019s time to be worried. Yes, the offensive line stinks. But Stroud has thrown 13 interceptions in his last 17 games and has just one big-time throw this season, per PFF. It\u2019s fair to be concerned.\n\nUp next: vs. Titans, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n28. New York Jets (0-3)\n\nLast week: 26\n\nSunday: Lost to Buccaneers 29-27\n\nQB confidence: Is it mock draft season yet?\n\nJustin Fields led the NFL in turnover-worthy throws during his two starts for the Jets. Tyrod Taylor took a different approach in relief of Fields on Sunday, keeping everything short, and ranks 35th among 36 quarterbacks in air yards per throw. New York\u2019s schedule gets a lot easier the next two weeks, but so far, Aaron Glenn needs more from his quarterback.\n\nUp next: at Dolphins, Monday, 7:15 p.m. ET\n\n29. Tennessee Titans (0-3)\n\nLast week: 29\n\nSunday: Lost to Colts 41-20\n\nQB confidence: Dropping with each hit\n\nCam Ward has been sacked on 13 percent of his dropbacks, the highest rate in the league among quarterbacks with at least 45 dropbacks, and has been sacked a league-high 15 times. His numbers are bad \u2014 his 5.1 yards per attempt are only better than Flacco\u2019s \u2014 but he hasn\u2019t had much of a chance behind this O-line.\n\nUp next: at Texans, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n30. New York Giants (0-3)\n\nLast week: 30\n\nSunday: Lost to Chiefs 22-9\n\nQB confidence: Crashing \u2026 until there\u2019s a change\n\nThe home fans were chanting for rookie Jaxson Dart during \u201cSunday Night Football.\u201d And yet, shockingly, Russell Wilson\u2019s numbers have not been terrible. The three interceptions don\u2019t help, but Wilson ranks 20th in EPA per play and 12th in yards per attempt. However, that covers up some of the red zone woes where Wilson is 4-of-18 passing with no touchdowns this season. That is why Brian Daboll said Monday the team is \u201cevaluating everything.\u201d\n\nUp next: vs. Chargers, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\n31. Miami Dolphins (0-3)\n\nLast week: 32\n\nThursday: Lost to Bills 31-21\n\nQB confidence: Quickly crumbling\n\nFor a while, Mike McDaniel seemed like the perfect coach for Tua Tagovailoa. He instilled confidence in the quarterback and leaned into Tagovailoa\u2019s ability to get the ball out quickly. But it has been a disaster this season. Tagovailoa has thrown a turnover-worthy pass on 6.3 percent of his throws, per PFF, easily the highest mark of his career. Oh, and his cap hit next season is $56.4 million.\n\nUp next: vs. Jets, Monday, 7:15 p.m. ET\n\n32. New Orleans Saints (0-3)\n\nLast week: 28\n\nSunday: Lost to Seahawks 44-13\n\nQB confidence: Hard to have any\n\nSpencer Rattler is 0-9 as a starter in the NFL. After an impressive performance in Week 2, Rattler struggled on Sunday, throwing for just 218 yards on 43 dropbacks with a touchdown and an interception. He has thrown the second-most turnover-worthy passes of any quarterback with three starts, only better so far than Tagovailoa.\n\nUp next: at Bills, Sunday, 1 p.m. ET\n\nNFL Power Rankings is part of a partnership with NFL Sunday Ticket from YouTube TV.\n\nThe Athletic maintains full editorial independence.

                "article_summary": "After Week 3 of the NFL season, the Texans are struggling with an 0-3 record, well below preseason expectations, while their playoff odds have dropped significantly. In a dramatic game, the Eagles defeated the Rams with a last-minute blocked field goal returned for a touchdown, leaving Rams bettors disappointed. Additionally, Jaxson Dart has been named the Giants' starting quarterback, boosting his Rookie of the Year odds, and the Bills are heavily favored against the Saints with a 16.5-point spread, the largest of the season so far.",

                "text": "Week 3 is in the books.\n\nWith six undefeated and six winless teams, teams are starting to sort themselves out.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some NFL betting trends and storylines ahead of Week 4.\n\nThe disappointing Texans\n\nNo team has played further below its preseason expectations than the Texans.\n\nAfter making the playoffs in each of the past two seasons and coming into the year as the favorite in the AFC South, the Texans\u2019 chances in 2025 are already teetering.\n\nHouston is 0-3 with one-score losses to the Rams, Buccaneers, and Jaguars ahead of their matchup against the Titans next week.\n\nThe Texans came into the season at -150 to make the playoffs at FanDuel Sportsbook \u2014 they\u2019re now just +300 to make the postseason for the third straight year.\n\nEagles deliver brutal bad beat\n\nWe already may have the worst beat of the year.\n\nRams bettors were sitting pretty through the first half against the Eagles with Los Angeles seemingly pulling away with a 26-7 lead as 3.5-point underdogs in Philadelphia.\n\nIt went sideways from there.\n\nThe Eagles stormed back, taking a 27-26 lead before the Rams marched down the field to set themselves up for a 44-yard game-winning field goal with three seconds left in the game.\n\nEven if Rams kicker Joshua Karty simply kicked the ball wide of the uprights, his team would have covered the spread.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s not how it turned out.\n\nEagles defensive tackle Jordan Davis jumped the offensive line to block the field goal and returned the ball for a touchdown to widen Philadelphia\u2019s lead to 33-26 as the time expired, securing the win and covering the spread in a terrible loss for those who put their money on the Rams.\n\nDart time\n\nJaxson Dart is taking over in New York.\n\nAfter being named the Giants\u2019 starting quarterback to replace Russell Wilson, Dart\u2019s odds to win the Offensive Rookie of the Year award skyrocketed to +750, which is tied for the third-best odds at FanDuel.\n\nIf Dart plays anywhere near how he did during the preseason, when he completed 32 of 47 passes for 372 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions while also running the ball six times for 52 yards and a touchdown, look for those odds to get even better.\n\nBetting on the NFL?\n\nRead our expert guide on how to bet on the NFL\n\nCheck out the best NFL betting sites\n\nGet the BetMGM Bonus Code\n\nA wild spread in Buffalo\n\nWe might get our biggest mismatch of the season on Sunday.\n\nThe Super Bowl favorite Bills will welcome the lowly Saints to Buffalo, and oddsmakers are expecting it to get ugly.\n\nJosh Allen and Co. are currently a 16.5-point favorite \u2013 the largest spread of the year thus far.\n\nIt would have been the second-largest spread of the season last year, trailing only an early January contest between the Ravens and Browns in Baltimore when the former was a 19.5 favorite.\n\nWhy Trust New York Post Betting\n\nDylan Svoboda is a versatile writer and analyst across many sports.

While the series has since flashed back a few times, it has yet to revisit that moment, which means it\u2019s been out here as a destination while Jake and Vince Friedkin\u2019s cashflow problems have continued to pop off. Sham fundraisers and staff overdoses: there was a lot going on in Episode 3. But that same night offered a nod to the flash-forward, as Wes introduced Jake to Ben Baller, custom jeweler to the stars. That meeting is paid off here in Episode 5, as Jake meets with Baller\u2019s people to arrange a Tupperware Party-type bash at the Rabbit full of high-end jewelry and watches worth six figures. Black Rabbit\u2019s future is getting closer, but it\u2019s one Anna, the restaurant\u2019s fated VIP bartender, will never see.\n\nAnna was killed in her apartment when Junior and Babbitt forced their way in, she fled to the bathroom, slipped, and hit her head on the lip of the tub. Those guys have a plan to cover their tracks, even though they might have left something behind, and Campbell saw them leaving. But in the meantime, Jake and Vince learn of Anna\u2019s death from Ellen Seung (Hettienne Park) when the detective visits the Rabbit with more questions.\n\nAs the police circle, the Friedken boys also decide crime really does pay. It was Vince\u2019s idea first, but Jake\u2019s initial denials turn around when he realizes he needs quick cash, too: they\u2019ll arrange for an electrical fire at their mom\u2019s house, and collect on the insurance once it burns. With a bent building inspector and fire marshal in on the job, it\u2019s another instance in Black Rabbit where the phrase \u201cIt\u2019s a sure thing\u201d is doing a ton of heavy lifting.\n\nThe arson idea sounds as janky as the look of the 1970s space heater it hinges on, but somehow it works. And while they\u2019re at the house, Jake and Vince also smoke a J of ancient dirt weed while they lament their bar owner/gambler/alcoholic father Richard, aka \u201cBig Dick.\u201d (His nickname was embroidered in cursive on his bowling bag.) They got all of his worst qualities, but in a sibling split, so as Jake says to Vince, \u201cYou\u2019re a degenerate, and I\u2019m a fake.\u201d It\u2019s another moment in this series where the brothers\u2019 arguments against one another rage until they coalesce into acknowledgment that they are one in the same. They\u2019ll burn their past together, to make something of their future. Whether that future\u2019s together, well\u2026\n\nEstelle is willing to take the gloves off their affair and make a go of it with Jake, but in the course of her breakup fight with Wes, it seems like she really just needed any way out that was offered. Estelle says his music career and outsized personality have swallowed them up. \u201cYou are good,\u201d she tells Wes. I\u2019m not good.\u201d All he wants to know, though, is how many times she was with Jake, because he heard about their hookups from Roxie. Her plan since returning to the Rabbit is to buy out Jake\u2019s share, and she needs Wes\u2019s investment to do it. Once Estelle walks out, he angrily texts the chef that he\u2019s into her plan. \u201cLet\u2019s take him out.\u201d\n\nWith the arson money set to cover their debt to Mancuso, Jake and Vince are both flying high. A birthday party for Hunter at the restaurant includes a cake shaped like the Barclays Center, expensive tickets to the New York City ballet, and even some family bonding \u2013 Gen has come around to Vince being back, and asks her dad if he\u2019d like to attend a Mets game with her.\n\nIt would be progress if it didn\u2019t ignore all the other things Vince and Jake each continue to ignore, like barely addressing their supporting roles in Anna\u2019s death, and Junior and Babbitt have some input on that. Sure, the fat check to make the debt whole is appreciated. But the goons\u2019 version of celebrating is tossing the Friedken bros into a car at gunpoint and dragging them out to the river. They can\u2019t have the cops\u2019 questions about Anna leading back to them and Mancuso, so they\u2019ll execute Jake and Vince instead.\n\nAnd here\u2019s where the future of this series rears up again. Fresh from his meeting with Ben Baller\u2019s representative, and with a pistol jammed into the base of his neck, Jake thinks fast. More crime? Why not? He\u2019s already become an arsonist. \u201cThere\u2019s a million dollars in the Rabbit in two nights\u2019 time! Minimum security. You walk in, you take it, it\u2019s yours.\u201d Did Jake just arrange to knock over his own business?\n\nIt\u2019s a payout too tantalizing to ignore, so the Mancuso goons leave the Friedken brothers alive. But as they walk back to the city in their underwear, Jake and Vince\u2019s relationship breaks down again. \u201cI knew you\u2019d do it to me,\u201d Jake says. \u201cEverything that is wrong in my life is rooted in you.\u201d This is not entirely true \u2013 not even mostly true, as we\u2019ve seen. But Vince\u2019s return to New York and his gambling debt to dangerous people have torn open the places where Jake keeps his own bad decisions, the ones he leaves unresolved as he chases better, newer things.\n\nDJ Booth for Black Rabbit Episode 5 (\u201cTrailblazer\u201d):\n\nWe don\u2019t hear a whole lot of jams in Episode 5 of Black Rabbit \u2013 Vince and Jake are too busy making Backdraft references while they conspire to commit arson. But while at their mother\u2019s house, we hear some scratchy old recordings of Vince on drums, and learn their band name \u2013 Black Rabbits \u2013 was a riff off the original version, The Playboys, and the magazine\u2019s iconic leporid logo.\n\nVince and Jake also rescued a box of their old cassette tapes from the house before they torched it, and Vince ends up gifting them to Hunter for his birthday. We really wanted to see what bands or albums were in there, but Black Rabbit refused to show us.\n\nAnd is this the last of Vince\u2019s \u201cDeath to the Pixies\u201d T-shirt? He\u2019s worn it a few times throughout the season, but in their preparations to execute the Friedkens, Junior and Babbitt force them to strip, and Vince\u2019s vintage T is tossed in the East River along with the rest of their clothes. Guess that monkey\u2019s gone to heaven."

While he didn't explicitly mention the hurricane during the concert, the event served as a celebration of Puerto Rican resilience, uniting locals and fans worldwide in pride and cultural identity. The concert atmosphere reflected a collective spirit of hope and remembrance, with attendees expressing gratitude for Bad Bunny's role in uplifting the island's morale and addressing social issues through his music.",
                "source": "cnn",
                "text": "After completing his sold-out 30-show residency \u201cNo Me Quiero Ir de Aqu\u00ed\u201d (\u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Leave Here\u201d) in his hometown of San Juan, Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny invited the world to join the celebration with \u201cUna M\u00e1s\u201d (\u201cOne More\u201d), a special encore performance streamed on Amazon Prime over the weekend. It was no mistake that the final concert landed on September 20, marking the eighth anniversary since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and caused unprecedented damage.\n\nDuring the final show on Saturday night, surprise guest and reggaeton star \u00d1engo Flow wore a jersey with \u201c4,645\u201d on it, the number of victims Hurricane Maria reportedly claimed. Beyond that, Bad Bunny \u2013 whose real name is Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio \u2013 made no overt mention of the storm, but the anniversary was not lost on concertgoers, locals and virtual viewers alike.\n\nUpon arriving in Puerto Rico \u2013 my first time \u2013 my rideshare driver Javier Rosado struck up a conversation with me about my first impression of the island. It was beautiful. Before I told him why I was visiting, Rosado told me Bad Bunny\u2019s residency has lifted the Puerto Ricans\u2019 spirits; even just a few months ago, the island still felt \u201cdepressed\u201d from the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, he said.\n\n\u201cThey (the US government) have left us abandoned here, and this young man has given us national pride and put us in the spotlight,\u201d Rosado said. \u201cHe\u2019s put Puerto Rico\u2019s name all over the world. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve never seen before with an artist from here.\u201d\n\nNot long ago, Rosado was not all that keen on Bad Bunny\u2019s music. He found the rapper and reggaeton artist\u2019s lyrics provocative, but his 78-year-old mother was a big fan. Rosado said she was always singing \u201cLo Que Le Pas\u00f3 a Hawaii\u201d (\u201cWhat Happened to Hawaii\u201d) \u2013 a track warning Puerto Ricans of the privatized beaches, displacement and overtourism that transpired there \u2013 when she cooked, when she bathed, when she cleaned and when she watered the plants.\n\n\u201cIt drove me crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to take Mami to see that concert.\u201d\n\nSo he did. Rosado, his cousin and his mother all went to an earlier residency show, an experience he called \u201clife-changing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever has anything like this been seen (in Puerto Rico). He has managed to unite the entire population in a proud way \u2013 adults, young people. He has broken down all age barriers, he is showing the world how beautiful it is and (how) the United States government has forgotten us,\u201d Rosado said of Bad Bunny\u2019s impact. \u201cHere, the power goes out once a week. Little by little, we have many problems that are being addressed now because he is bringing attention to them. And he is bringing attention to many social issues that affect all of us.\u201d\n\nHours later, I was on my way to the concert venue to pick up my press pass and check out the block party scene ahead of the concert. Throughout the three months of Bad Bunny\u2019s residency, hundreds of viral TikToks had captured a festival-like market just outside the arena, which featured music, sponsored pop-ups, tables of unofficial merch and handcrafted souvenirs. Saturday was no exception.\n\n\u201cThis is like a Disney (World) for Puerto Ricans,\u201d said Keren Mendez, a local vendor selling handmade flowers for concertgoers to wear as hair accessories. Within the red, white and blue sea of flores de Maga (the national flower) and flags of all sizes, my eye was drawn to Kiki Vazquez, who was wearing an especially large, sky-blue version of the Puerto Rican flag as a cape.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the national, pro-independent side of Puerto Rico,\u201d she said of the shade. \u201cBut here in the concert, I don\u2019t think it matters, the status(es) of Puerto Rico. Just that you\u2019re Puerto Rican and celebrating our culture.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised on the island, Vazquez said she felt a unique sense of pride to be in attendance on the anniversary date of Hurricane Maria.\n\n\u201c I took the Bar (exam) \u2013 I\u2019m a lawyer \u2013 three days before that, then headed home to Puerto Rico, and I was without power for four months in my house,\u201d she recollected of the time. \u201cWe had no generator. But everyone was out and about helping each other. And I think today the concert will reflect that even though there was no power, there was power in the people.\u201d\n\nFrom strollers to wheelchairs, people of all ages were heading into the arena. Nilsa Medina Pi\u00f1a, a retired professor from the University of Puerto Rico, was helping collect signatures among the youth for Citizen Victory Movement (MVC), an anti-colonial political party that has rallied unprecedented support in recent elections.\n\nShe stated that Puerto Rico must \u201cselect a leader who truly represents what we are seeing here at this concert, which is to defend our national heritage, defend our coast, our natural resources, and the right of Puerto Ricans to have a sustainable country with its own economy and a political system that allows for the most effective participation of all its members.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been living through this natural and social disaster for eight years,\u201d she added of the hurricane\u2019s aftermath. \u201cA phenomenon like a hurricane occurs, but it doesn\u2019t happen in a social vacuum. It occurs in a country with great economic and social inequalities, which means that the dead are mainly poor people, people who are at an economic disadvantage compared to the wealthier population in the country.\u201d\n\nAlthough Medina Pi\u00f1a was not initially a fan of Bad Bunny, little by little, she has begun to appreciate the way he has civically awakened and culturally united the island\u2019s youth. Three years ago, Bad Bunny broke the internet when he dropped \u201cEl Apag\u00f3n \u2013 Aqui Vive Gente\u201d (\u201cThe Blackout \u2013 People Live Here\u201d), a nearly 23-minute music video that doubled as an investigative documentary highlighting the social inequalities Puerto Ricans were still facing since Hurricane Maria. While the song was used in the closing act of Bad Bunny\u2019s 2022 \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti\u201d (\u201cA Summer Without You\u201d) tour shows, it played in the first act of Saturday\u2019s show \u2013 and still sprung everyone to their feet.\n\nAfter the concert, Kacho L\u00f3pez Mari, the director behind that Cannes-nominated music video documentary, told me he heard comments about the lack of overt mention of Hurricane Maria during the final show, but explained that Bad Bunny\u2019s artistic statement \u2013 and intentional date selection \u2013 spoke volumes.\n\n\u201cSo how do musicians talk? They talk through their music. He could have done it on the 19th, he could have done it on the 21st, Sunday. He talked about (Hurricane) Mar\u00eda in a song, and he made a 22-minute documentary about her, man,\u201d L\u00f3pez Mari said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not celebrating Mar\u00eda, he\u2019s celebrating the coolest residency in the history of Puerto Rico, and now he\u2019s going on tour to show the world what he did,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo you think that in that celebration, we necessarily have to go back to a crisis, back to a trauma? The past is over. Let\u2019s learn from it, but let\u2019s not get stuck there. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s coming, and what\u2019s coming looks like it could be better than what happened.\u201d\n\nDuring the show, families, couples and strangers danced together with glowing intensity while some children fell asleep on the plastic seats. A record-breaking number of viewers tuned into the Amazon Prime livestream from around the world. From salsa legend Marc Anthony to singer-songwriter Chuwi to Jowell & Randy \u2013 a reggaeton rap duo that joined other surprise artists for a photo depicting what the internet has dubbed \u201cthe Avengers of reggaeton\u201d \u2013 it was a parade of Puerto Rican musical icons building up the message of love, pride and authenticity that originated and reverberated onstage from Bad Bunny.\n\n\u201cI promise you I will never change. I love you, Puerto Rico,\u201d he said in Spanish before bidding goodbye with his album title track, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d (\u201cI should have taken more photos\u201d).\n\n\u201cNever forget what the song says: Mientras uno est\u00e9 vivo, uno debe amar lo m\u00e1s que pueda (As long as one is alive, one should love as much as one can). What has already happened cannot be changed. We can only learn from it,\u201d Bad Bunny continued, in a rally of resilience to the audience. \u201cTo all those who left Puerto Rico dreaming of one day returning, and to those of us who are still here: No me quiero ir de aqu\u00ed. Seguimos aqu\u00ed, p****a (I don\u2019t want to leave here. We\u2019re still here, damn it)!\u201d"

While raising him, Evans told CNN she found support among a community of other parents who helped her navigate having a child with his special needs.\n\n\u201cI met a parent just before we even had a diagnosis, and she was like \u2018Well, have you had an IEP [Individualized Education Program for a child with a disability] yet?\u2019,\u201d Evans recalled. \u201cAnd I hadn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThat was the beginning of learning what would prove to be invaluable information for both Evans and Ryder, who is the youngest of her four children.\n\nThe Grammy-winning singer founded Ryder\u2019s Room Inc. to help other families like hers access tools and resources to support loved ones with autism. Their inaugural Ryder\u2019s Room Gala is scheduled for Saturday, September 27 at The Newark Museum of Art.\n\nSome of her artist friends are participating, including rapper MC Lyte, comedian and actor Mike Epps, R&B music singer and Christoper Williams, hip-hop artist and producer Redman, Broadway actor and recording artist Avery Wilson, rapper and songwriter Freeway and hip-hop artist Lil\u2019 Cease.\n\nHaving a strong community means everything, Evans said, especially for parents whose children have autism.\n\n\u201cYou feel like you\u2019re alone in a lot of those moments because there\u2019s some moments I\u2019ve had where it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God.\u2019 But then I gotta just keep it moving,\u201d Evans said.\n\nThat can-do attitude has also been adopted by her son, who Evans said is very much a teen.\n\n\u201cHe has that pubescent energy and he knows what he likes. He likes thick women,\u201d she said, laughing.\n\nEvans said she\u2019s grateful for her continued fan base that has been rocking with her since her debut album, \u201cFaith,\u201d was released in 1995.\n\nEven as she has stepped away from music in recent years, her supporters are still there.\n\n\u201cMy new normal is that God has another assignment for me. That doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t see the blessing and having a fan base and having a gift that has touched people in many different ways,\u201d Evans said. \u201cHowever, you know, my assignment is to be there for my son and what he needs. I am his number one advocate.\u201d\n\nAnd he is her number one fan."

But her bid was hurt by a seven-game absence following an injury sustained in a win over Wilson\u2019s Aces, a layoff that coincided with the start of Las Vegas\u2019 16-game winning streak \u2013 during which Wilson averaged 26.1 points and 12.0 rebounds.\n\nWilson and Collier may yet face off the in the WNBA finals, with the Lynx set to begin their own best-of-five semifinal against the Phoenix Mercury on Sunday."

The Liberty became the first men\u2019s or women\u2019s basketball team from New York to raise a banner since the ABA\u2019s Nets back in 1976, sending a sellout crowd of 18,090 fans into a state of bedlam at the buzzer.\n\n\u201cI could never dream of this,\u201d said the Bahamian-born Jones, a first-time WNBA champion who was named Most Valuable Player of the finals after averaging 17.8 points and 7.6 rebounds while shooting 54.2% from the field across the five contests. \u201cYou know how many times I\u2019ve been denied. It was delayed. I am so happy to do it here.\u201d\n\nNapheesa Collier, the WNBA\u2019s defensive player of the year, scored 22 points to lead Minnesota before fouling out in the dying seconds of overtime. Kayla McBride added 21 for the Lynx.\n\nThe Liberty were one of the original eight WNBA franchises and the lone member of that group to have not won a championship. No longer.

Because this shit was stolen from us.\u201d\n\nLeonie Fiebich\u2019s three-pointer early in overtime put New York ahead for good, before Sabally\u2019s steal and breakaway lay-up opened a 65-60 lead with 3:14 remaining that left Minnesota on the ropes. The Lynx got as close as 65-62 with 18.4 seconds left and possession, but Bridget Carleton\u2019s missed three dashed their hopes.\n\n\u201cThat was ugly, but we found a way to win,\u201d New York coach Sandy Brondello said.\n\nStewart, who never left the floor, finished with 13 points, 15 rebounds and four assists. Ionescu logged five points, eight assists and seven rebounds, while Sabally added a crucial 13 points and seven rebounds off the bench. When it was finished, the capacity crowd celebrated in the stands and the court was showered with streamers and confetti while Frank Sinatra\u2019s New York, New York and Jay-Z\u2019s Empire State of Mind played on the arena soundsystem.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been manifesting this moment for awhile, There\u2019s no feeling like it,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cCredit to Minnesota they gave us a tough series. The fans have been amazing everywhere we\u2019ve gone. To bring a championship to New York, first ever in franchise history it\u2019s an incredible feeling. I can\u2019t wait to continue to celebrate with the city. it\u2019s going to be bonkers.\u201d\n\nThe best-of-five finals between the Liberty and the Lynx will go down as one of the most dramatic in WNBA history. All five games came down to the last few possessions, with the first and fifth contests going to overtime and the third featuring a last-second winner. WNBA commissioner Cathy Englebert announced before Game 1 that it will be moving to a best-of-seven format starting with next year\u2019s finals.\n\nMinnesota were denied in their bid for a record fifth WNBA championship, remaining level with the Seattle Storm and Houston Comets on four titles. The Lynx won all of those from 2011 through 2017, featuring a core four of Lindsay Whalen, Maya Moore, Seimone Augustus and Rebekkah Brunson, but didn\u2019t make it back to the finals until this year."

For me, when I was a kid, I\u2019ve had the same passion since I was 3. I always wanted to be kind of who I am, I could envision it. And it just kind of felt like it was taken from me. And that was a hard pill to swallow. I was devastated, I was sad, I was emotional.\u201d\n\nThe Celtics are set to begin training camp next week.\n\n(Photo: Wendell Cruz / Imagn Images)"

But Mills responded on social media with a handful of posts defending his military service and past statements, even posting a letter signed by a fellow service member from his time in Iraq to respond to attacks that have been leveled previously against the Florida lawmaker.\n\n\u201cOn multiple occasions Team-21 was attacked by insurgents with improvised explosive devices (IEDs and EFPs),\u201d the letter reads. \u201cCory was present for two of these attacks.\u201d\n\nThe letter goes on to defend Mills\u2019 statements that he had been \u201cblown up\u201d on two missions in Iraq, incidents that Mace has specifically questioned.\n\n\u201cI understand that there may be a question as to what \u201cblown up\u201d means to the military contractors that served in Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d the letter states. It refers (in contractor speak) to being in a motorcade struck by improvised explosive devices. It does not necessarily mean that you are physically \u201cblown up\u201d or even seriously wounded.\u201d\n\nMace dismissed his responses in follow-up posts."

Duffy announced $42 million in grants to enhance safety on the railway, asserting that the funds were announced under Buttigieg's leadership but never delivered. In response, Buttigieg's spokesperson dismissed the claims as \"nonsense,\" highlighting the administration's record of completed projects during his tenure.",

                "text": "NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy is slamming the Biden administration, especially former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, for leaving behind an \"unprecedented backlog\" of critical infrastructure safety improvements across the country.\n\nA spokesperson for Buttigieg, who is a rumored 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, dismissed the DOT\u2019s criticisms as \"nonsense.\"\n\nThis week, Duffy announced that his department is obligating four grants, totaling $42 million, to improve safety on Florida\u2019s Brightline high speed railway, which runs from Miami to Orlando. According to the department, the grants were announced and touted under Buttigieg\u2019s leadership, but the Biden administration never actually delivered on obligating those funds.\n\nThe DOT said the Trump administration inherited a backlog of over 3,200 grants that were announced but never obligated by Buttigieg-Biden. The department said that this has \"delayed critical investments in communities across the country.\"\n\nDUFFY EXPANDS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TRAINING PROGRAM TO FIGHT NATIONWIDE SHORTAGE\n\nIn Florida, the oldest grant now being obligated by the Trump administration was first announced three years ago in 2022. The department said that \"after much fanfare, their administration failed to do any of the work to actually process and deliver these funds to Brightline or project sponsors in Florida.\"\n\nDOT said these unfulfilled grants were to help install safety fencing, grade crossing upgrades and a trespassing alert system. The grants included $24.9 million for a trespassing and intrusion mitigation project, $15.4 million for a Broward County sealed corridor project, $1.6 million for a trespassing identification and classification system and a $150,000 grant for Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office to support overtime costs for enforcement of pedestrian trespassing at hot spots.\n\n\"Under Secretary Duffy\u2019s direction, the Department of Transportation is working diligently to accelerate the distribution of these long-overdue funds and address core infrastructure projects,\" said DOT.\n\nIn the statement, Duffy called the unfulfilled safety grants \"the latest consequence of the unprecedented Biden-Buttigieg backlog.\"\n\nOne of the defining moments of Buttigieg\u2019s tenure as transportation secretary involved a major train wreck that released toxic materials in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023. While Buttigieg was criticized for his handling of the crisis, he placed the blame on the Trump administration for reversing a rail regulation because of a law passed by Congress in 2015.\n\n\"Their failure to execute on these rail grants \u2013 some of which stretch back years \u2014 put Brightline\u2019s three million annual passengers and Florida communities in unnecessary danger,\" said Duffy. \"Under President Trump\u2019s leadership, America is building again. We are delivering critical resources in record time to enhance safety on our railways, roads, and bridges.\"\n\nBUTTIGIEG 'GOT NOTHING DONE,' DUFFY DECLARES: 'PETE APPEARS UNBURDENED BY NO LONGER BEING A CABINET SECRETARY'\n\nIn response, Chris Meagher, a spokesman for Buttigieg, dismissed the DOT\u2019s criticisms as \"more of the same nonsense we've heard from them in the past.\"\n\n\"We invested in more projects than any administration in the past, and more than 22,000 projects were completed during Pete's time in office,\" Meagher told Fox News Digital.\n\nHe said that during Buttigieg\u2019s tenure, the DOT announced more than $390 billion of funding for more than 78,000 projects, more than 22,000 of which were completed, including 445 rail projects, over 200,000 miles of roadway repairs and improvements, over 12,300 projects to build, repair and modernize bridges, and other projects.\n\nHe noted that \"some of those projects take time to get done right.\"\n\n\"As with any change in Administration, it then becomes the job of the incoming Administration to finish the job, which is nothing new,\" said Meagher. \"What is new is that the current officeholder complains about it instead of just getting the job done.\"\n\nBIDEN'S STAFF WANTED A COGNITIVE TEST TAKEN AFTER 2024 PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump DOT, meanwhile, told Fox News Digital that while Buttigieg and Biden \"talked a big game,\" their backlog \"speaks volumes.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"They didn\u2019t do the hard work to actually get critical infrastructure dollars out the door. Instead, they spent their time wasting billions on DEI programs and worrying about whether the term cockpit was offensive,\" said the spokesperson.\n\n\"The contrast here couldn\u2019t be more clear,\" the spokesperson went on. \"In less than a year, Secretary Duffy has moved quickly to get clear the backlog and invest in real infrastructure projects like these rail grants. Brightline riders and Florida communities will be safer because of it.\""

The Tories have claimed that it used a \u201cfalse excuse\u201d of administrative errors.\n\nThey have now released a leaked email from Labour lawyer Gerald Shamash, in which he advised McSweeney to drop his claim that he had been told he did not have to declare the donations, adding that he hoped to minimise publicity for the rule breach.\n\n\u201cMy advice, but it is in practice the only realistic route, we are being and have to be seen as transparent as possible,\u201d Shamash wrote. \u201cThe amounts of the late reported donations is \u00a3739,492 and there are, in my view, no easy way to explain how Labour Together finds itself in this situation.\n\n\u201cIf Labour Together cannot deal substantively with questions I pose then perhaps simply best to base our case as to the non-reporting down as admin error.\u201d\n\nIt was only after McSweeney\u2019s departure from the organisation that his replacement, Hannah O\u2019Rourke, found almost three years of donations had not been declared and filed a series of late declarations to the watchdog.\n\nDavid Lammy, the deputy prime minister, has described the allegations over McSweeney\u2019s handling of the donations as \u201cmuck-racking\u201d but the emails threaten to reopen controversy surrounding Labour Together, which has supported Starmer\u2019s leadership.\n\nMcSweeney, who masterminded Labour\u2019s 2024 election landslide, left his role with the thinktank in April 2020 to become a senior aide to Starmer in opposition and then in government.\n\nHowever, he has been facing growing unrest from Labour MPs in recent weeks over the party\u2019s poor poll ratings, as well as criticism over his advice to Starmer to appoint Peter Mandelson as US ambassador despite knowing about his links to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction.\n\nDowning Street has refused to answer questions about McSweeney\u2019s time at Labour Together, but Starmer\u2019s official spokesperson said the prime minister continued to have \u201cfull confidence\u201d in his chief of staff.\n\nKevin Hollinrake, the Tory party chair, said: \u201cThe Conservatives are taking the unprecedented step of publishing leaked correspondence of the legal advice given to Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.\n\n\u201cIt shows how authorities may have been misled over hundreds of thousands of pounds of donations used to install Starmer as Labour leader. We believe there is a strong public interest in revealing the full truth to the public about possible criminal wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nAfter the allegations first emerged at the weekend, a spokesperson for the thinktank said: \u201cLabour Together proactively raised concerns about its own reporting of donations to the Electoral Commission in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Commission\u2019s investigation, with which Labour Together fully cooperated, was completed in 2021. The outcome was made public and widely covered by the media at the time. Since this time, we have taken measures to ensure Labour Together is fully compliant with all Electoral Commission regulations.\u201d\n\nAn Electoral Commission spokesperson said: \u201cThe commission thoroughly investigated the late reporting of donations by Labour Together and published our findings in 2021.\n\n\u201cWe were satisfied that the evidence proved beyond reasonable doubt that failures by the association occurred without reasonable excuse. Offences were determined and they were sanctioned accordingly.\u201d"

Nothing is being done,\u2019\u201d the president said on Truth Social over the weekend.\n\nMizelle\u2019s planned departure, which multiple sources had previously confirmed to CNN, also comes as the department faces intense backlash over its decision not to release any additional evidence related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation after Bondi made assurances she would do so.\n\nMultiple sources said Mizelle\u2019s departure is not related to Epstein, but nine months is a comparatively short tenure for a chief of staff.\n\nAxios first reported on Mizelle\u2019s expected exit.\n\nTrump announced in December that Mizelle would be serving as chief of staff at the department. He has also served as acting associate attorney general \u2013 the third-most-senior position at DOJ.\n\nMizelle, who held several key positions in the first Trump administration, worked as the chief legal officer at the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner\u2019s private equity firm before being tapped to return to Washington, DC.\n\nMizelle relocated to Washington for the job while his wife, a federal judge, and children remained in Florida. He had previously told people he planned to return to Florida after his time in government was complete. A source told CNN that Mizelle\u2019s decision to leave was largely based on his desire to spend more time with his family.\n\nRecently, several White House staffers have been vocal about their frustration with Mizelle, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. There is no indication that the frustrations reached the president.\n\nThe frustrations stemmed from the belief that Mizelle should have been protecting Bondi from the fallout over the Epstein files controversy, the sources said. The blame came as early as February, when she distributed binders labeled as the Epstein files to influencers at the White House. The influencers shared later that there was no new information in the binders.\n\n\u201cPer usual, unnamed sources get it wrong \u2013 Chad Mizelle played a key role in securing countless legal victories and helped deliver on many of President Trump\u2019s key promises,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement. \u201cThe entire Administration appreciates his hard work and dedication to our country.\u201d\n\nThe department has been through a series of controversies aside from Epstein \u2013 including firing thousands of employees, court fights over deportations, accusations of a quid pro quo for dropping corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, as well as probes into former President Joe Biden and those who prosecuted the January 6, 2021, US Capitol rioters.\n\nBehind the scenes, Mizelle served as a top adviser to Bondi, but he also took a public-facing role in many of the department\u2019s biggest cases.\n\nIn his capacity as acting associate attorney general, Mizelle signed onto court filings and argued on behalf of the administration, notably defending Trump\u2019s executive orders targeting large law firms.\n\nMizelle was also prolific on X, posting threads defending the department\u2019s work. He railed against district judges who he claimed overreached their authority and pushed arguments in defense of dropping the case against Adams.\n\nMizelle\u2019s departure comes shortly after Emil Bove was tapped to serve as an appellate judge after serving in top roles at DOJ for just a few months. Bove was confirmed in July.\n\nIt is not clear where Mizelle is headed next. During the first Trump administration, Mizelle held top legal positions at the Department of Homeland Security, the White House counsel\u2019s office, and the deputy attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nMizelle \u201cplayed a key role in advancing the President\u2019s America First agenda here at the Department, and his efforts strengthened our mission to protect the American people.

The story highlighted a significant oversight by the Capitol Hill press corps, which failed to notice Granger's absence from voting for months despite her long tenure and previous leadership role. The incident underscores the decline of local journalism that once closely monitored lawmakers, raising concerns about the ability of national media to adequately cover less prominent politicians.",
                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "In 2023, a small website called The Dallas Express picked up a startling allegation: Texas Rep. Kay Granger, one of the most powerful GOP members of Congress, was struggling with dementia.\n\nThe publication \u201cactually got a tip from a senior staffer in her office that she was having issues,\u201d said Chris Putnam, the Express\u2019 CEO. \u201cThey got the date and location for her visiting the Brain Institute and had a reporter there and got eyes on her. They didn\u2019t get a photograph of her.\u201d\n\nThere wasn\u2019t enough to go on. But the next year, the idea was still around, even though Granger had stepped down from chairing the Appropriations Committee and wasn\u2019t running again. When the publication was unable to reach the Fort Worth Republican for a story, Putnam said, \u201cI checked roll call, and I saw that she hadn\u2019t cast a vote since early July.\u201d\n\nThe tip: For months, she\u2019d been living in an assisted-living facility in Texas that also includes memory care. A reporter was sent to the facility. \u201cWe fully expected them to just basically escort him out,\u201d Putnam said. \u201cBut no, they sent a representative out and they acknowledged it.\u201d\n\nThe story broke in December, shortly before Granger\u2019s long-planned retirement, and was confirmed several days later by Granger\u2019s son, who acknowledged \u201cdementia issues\u201d in a Dallas Morning News interview. As the news ricocheted around the political world, a Texas website with an editorial staff of 10 was credited with a massive scoop \u2014 while the Capitol Hill press corps was pilloried for supposedly taking its eye off the ball.\n\nGiven that the U.S. Capitol is one of the few buildings in America where the reporting corps hasn\u2019t been totally devastated, it was a confounding miss. Granger wasn\u2019t a nobody. She\u2019d been in office for over a quarter-century, and had been the top Republican on the Appropriations committee until last April. Her face was familiar both to her colleagues and the reporters who roam outside the House chamber. Curiosity might also have been triggered by the fact that she\u2019d voluntarily stepped aside from a plum position that most members of Congress would have to have pried from their hands.\n\nThere were also at least some opportunities for journalists to find out what was happening. Granger may have been absent from votes, but she briefly returned to the Hill for a retirement salute to her last November, well into the period where her son acknowledged \u201cdementia issues\u201d and just a month before the Express story broke.\n\nAt the chummy event, speakers included House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, as well as Democrats Rosa DeLauro and Nita Lowey. Nobody mentioned anything awry when Granger, still an elected official, reappeared not for an important vote but for a laudatory send-off. During the tribute, Granger sat and looked on as her official portrait as a former Appropriations Committee chair was unveiled before a large audience of congressional colleagues and staffers.\n\nOr, as reporters call them, \u201csources.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like the proximate issue was unknown. Between Joe Biden and Dianne Feinstein, the conversation about elderly and possibly impaired politicians was already roiling Washington, which ought to have pricked up people\u2019s radar.\n\nBut even without the details of cognitive health \u2014 which are dicey to report on because even impaired people have good days, because political allies are often in denial, and because actual doctors won\u2019t talk \u2014 it seemed odd: Just how did a 2,000-member strong press corps allow a well-known lawmaker to vanish from the scene for months? It\u2019s the kind of omission that fuels the endemic distrust toward Washington and the news media.\n\nIn the movie version, the whole thing would play like a David-and-Goliath journalism story. While the entitled congressional press corps twiddles its thumbs in Washington, a plucky local news site bravely digs up an outrage that powerful insiders have kept from the public. Cue the Oscars!\n\nIn fact, the story of how the congressional media missed the story and the obscure hometown site broke the news is a bit more complicated than that. The Dallas Express is not exactly your central casting team of underdog hometown nobodies: It\u2019s a website run by Putnam, a politically wired conservative who once ran a primary campaign against Granger from the right. For another thing, Hill reporters are nobody\u2019s idea of lazy Beltway swells. It\u2019s an impossibly competitive 24-hour battle for scoops without much time for thumb-twiddling.\n\nInstead of a fable about idealistic outsiders beating entitled insiders, the story of this failure is also about what kind of outlets cover the Hill now, what kind have receded, and how this dynamic shapes the political conversation.\n\nThe basic change: Politics- or policy-centric outlets with a national focus have established major footholds. But there\u2019s been a hollowing out of the hometown outlets who once sent reporters to Washington with orders to watchdog their local lawmaker, whether or not that lawmaker was a big shot.\n\n\u201cOur number used to be in the hundreds,\u201d said Nick Grube, the Washington correspondent for Honolulu Civil Beat and the president of the Regional Reporters Association, which represents Beltway reporters for local outlets around the country. \u201cNow we\u2019re in the dozens.\u201d\n\nThe decline has been going on for some time and is often discussed \u2014 like the simultaneous drop-off in reporters covering local governments \u2014 as a problem for American democracy. Which it is. But for dishy scandals in Washington, it also has created a capacity problem: With fewer reporters dedicated to tracking back-bench legislators or regional obsessions, the media has lost some of the first-alert mechanisms that would flag potential headline-grabbers.\n\nInstead, the new normal has much more rigorous coverage of leadership \u2014 and a much easier opportunity for congressional small fries to go unnoticed. It\u2019s not that no obscure misdemeanants can be caught by the current press setup: I\u2019m pretty sure my bosses at POLITICO would have been very happy for me or any other colleague to have the scoop. But in a press corps without the local outlets that dedicate reporters to specific delegations, it\u2019s all that much less likely.\n\nConsider a story from earlier in Grube\u2019s tenure as the only reporter in Washington focused on covering the Capitol\u2019s two senators and two representatives from Hawaii. Coming off parental leave in 2022, Grube returned to work after a three-month absence. He immediately began walking the humble footpath of his four-lawmaker beat.\n\nBut in the office of Democratic Rep. Kai Kahele, things seemed off. \u201cMy first day back, I pop into every member\u2019s office and saying, \u2018Hello, I\u2019m back.\u2019 And his people start obfuscating.\u201d\n\nAccording to Grube\u2019s reporting, Kahele hadn\u2019t been in Washington for months. Subsequent stories about his whereabouts \u2014 he\u2019d earned income from a part-time airline job and spent the months laying groundwork for a gubernatorial run \u2014 led to more reporting that ultimately prompted an ethics investigation, which concluded that he may have \u201cmisused official resources\u201d for campaign purposes.\n\n\u201cThe thing was, no one else cared about the story,\u201d Grube told me. \u201cBut in Hawaii it mattered.\u201d After his initial reporting, that changed, and the Kahele story was picked up in the national media. Yet without the unglamorous questions from a front-line beat reporter, the story would not have acquired enough details to be interesting beyond the Aloha State.\n\nThe story has some obvious similarities to the Granger story, and one big difference: Grube\u2019s beat involves just four members. The paper in Granger\u2019s native Fort Worth, by contrast, no longer has a full-time D.C. reporter. And the big outlet in nearby Dallas has shrunk its own presence precipitously. (Granger\u2019s son, who had acknowledged her struggles following the initial reports, declined further comment when I reached out.)\n\n\u201cThe Dallas Morning News, I would argue, probably would have noticed that and done a story about that a few years ago, before the bureau went down to one,\u201d said Todd Gillman, who ran the bureau as its staff plummeted. When Gillman first arrived, he said, there were 11 journalists, and he knew his job was to cover the entire Texas contingent on the Hill, not just Dallas\u2019 half of the metroplex region. \u201cI got dinged on my annual review if I hadn\u2019t mentioned every single member of the Texas delegation at least once over the course of a year,\u201d Gillman told me. By the time he left, there was just one, with a job that involved not just Congress but also the White House and everything else happening around D.C. \u201cYou\u2019re certainly not paying attention to everybody in the delegation.\u201d\n\nWith that obligation gone, \u201cindividual members can do all sorts of stuff under the radar,\u201d Gillman said. \u201cGood, bad, venal, self-serving, extremist.\u201d Gillman knows what he\u2019s talking about: Today, he leads the Washington newsroom for Arizona State University\u2019s Cronkite journalism school, whose student reporters, he said, are the only full-time journalists covering Washington for an Arizona outlet.\n\nIt\u2019s confounding that a robust media contingent like the one that covers Congress can\u2019t create a structure for paying attention to the relative nobodies among the 535 people who legislate for the United States. After all, according to the most recent congressional directories, more than 2,200 journalists have credentials to cover the Capitol.\n\nBut even in this relatively well-staffed environment, chasing down random individual members, or obsessing over the priorities of far-flung constituents, doesn\u2019t line up with the business needs of the outlets that have thrived in the 21st century congressional media world.\n\nNational outlets are going to focus on Congress as a whole, meaning the power players who run it and the major issues before it, with a dash of coverage for the occasional high-profile backbencher. The ideological outlets are going to focus on policing their own side against softness, or maybe sticking it to the big-name lawmakers on the other side. And the policy outlets are going to get granular on lawmakers who deal with whatever the publication is about, like finance or aviation.\n\nIf Granger had still been the Appropriations Committee chair when she stopped showing up for votes, it\u2019s hard to imagine that it would have gone unnoticed. But because she\u2019d stepped back from that crucially powerful job, the most energetic attention was elsewhere. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that reporters for all kinds of outlets might have asked questions about age earlier, when she was in a more powerful position \u2014 and didn\u2019t, in ways that mirrored other recent elderly politician controversies.\n\nOnce she stopped voting, there were even fewer eyes on her. There\u2019s a lot of capacity in this ecosystem, but not a lot of financial incentive to cover members just because they\u2019re there. Or, as it happens, not there.\n\nThe good news is that, after the Biden years, it\u2019s a lot less likely that a Granger-type situation would go uncovered. That\u2019s because the issue of aging pols has been elevated to an important national subject, meaning even the most obscure lawmaker\u2019s senior moment could potentially be a story.\n\nBut for stories that don\u2019t involve something officially newsy, there\u2019s little sign that the Granger story has led to any change in big-newsroom protocols that would make up for the decline of local outlets that actually bird-dog backbenchers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re never going to pay close attention,\u201d said Gillman. \u201cThe most extreme cases of misconduct or wackiness are going to draw the attention of the national players, but the more medium-level cases of iffy behavior or venality or wackiness are probably not going to get attention unless it involves somebody who is in leadership or otherwise extremely high profile.\u201d\n\nInstead, philanthropically funded outlets may be left to do what the free market cannot. Grube\u2019s Hawaii outlet and Gillman\u2019s project with the Cronkite School are nonprofits whose funding enables them to do the local-delegation work once done by no-longer-profitable hometown papers. And the Allbritton Journalism Institute last month announced the launch of the Washington Bureau Initiative, underwritten by a $500,000 grant from Google and money from several other charitable outfits. The initiative funds Washington reporters who work with nonprofit newsrooms covering Oklahoma, Louisiana, San Diego and Stockton, California, among other places.

He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\nLast year, Routh fled from the golf course without firing a shot after a US Secret Service agent patrolling the course ahead of Trump spotted Routh and the rifle and opened fire, according to witness testimony in the case.\n\n\u201cThis plot was carefully crafted and deadly serious,\u201d prosecutor John Shipley said at the start of the trial, adding that without the intervention of the Secret Service agent, \u201cDonald Trump would not be alive\u201d.\n\n\u2018Political violence\u2019\n\nThe 12-day trial in a federal court in Fort Pierce, Florida, unfolded in the aftermath of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which again thrust the growth of political violence in the US to the centre of the national conversation.\n\nTrump was targeted in two assassination attempts, including one that wounded him in the ear, during his 2024 presidential campaign that returned him to the White House.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s guilty verdict against would-be Trump assassin Ryan Routh illustrates the Department of Justice\u2019s commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence,\u201d Attorney General Bondi said in a statement on X. \u201cThis attempted assassination was not only an attack on our President, but an affront to our very nation itself.\u201d\n\nTrump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, lauded the verdict, adding, \u201cThis was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him.\u201d\n\nRouth appeared to try to stab himself with a pen several times after the verdict was revealed in court, and had to be restrained by US marshals, according to US media reports. His daughter, Sara, also yelled in court that her father had not hurt anyone and that she would get him out of prison.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Routh arrived in South Florida about a month before the September 15, 2024, incident, staying at a truck stop and tracking Trump\u2019s movements and schedule. Routh allegedly carried six mobile phones and used fake names to conceal his identity.\n\nHe lay in wait for nearly 10 hours on the day of the incident, concealing himself in thick bushes overlooking the sixth hole green, prosecutors alleged. Investigators at the scene found a semiautomatic rifle, two bags containing metal plates like those used in body armour, and a small video camera pointed towards the course.\n\nTrump was on the fifth hole a few hundred yards away when Routh was discovered. He was arrested later that afternoon after being stopped by police along a Florida highway."

Nearly three hours of video and audio clips obtained by the Associated Press through a Freedom of Information Act request shed new light on the shooting that has escalated tensions amid a federal immigration crackdown in the country\u2019s third-largest city.\n\nDHS said Villegas Gonz\u00e1lez drove his car at officers, dragging one of them \u201ca significant distance\u201d, leaving the officer to \u201cfear for his life\u201d. The officer then opened fire. Federal officials have said their officers weren\u2019t wearing body cameras at the time.\n\nFranklin Park police footage shows local officers arriving at the roadside where a car had crashed into a cargo truck in Franklin Park, about 18 miles (29km) west of Chicago.\n\nTwo Ice agents attempt to explain to the police officer what had happened moments after an agent shot and killed Villegas Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\n\u201cHe tried to run us over,\u201d an Ice agent says.\n\n\u201cI got dragged a little bit,\u201d said the injured agent, who can be seen walking and talking while wearing ripped jeans with blood on them.\n\nThe videos show the first agent saying his partner had suffered \u201ca left knee injury and some lacerations to his hands\u201d while speaking over a radio.\n\n\u201cNothing major\u201d, the injured officer says while putting his arms up to shrug off concerns.\n\nImmigrant rights advocates, Illinois\u2019 top elected officials and Mexico\u2019s president have called for a thorough investigation and more transparency after the shooting that put area schools on lockdown and prompted protests.\n\n\u201cWe want answers to questions that we have raised,\u201d said Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda, a Democratic US representative in Chicago, on Tuesday. \u201cThe family is entitled to it. The community wants to know what is going on, and the public deserves answers as well.\u201d\n\nFederal officials had previously said the agent suffered \u201cmultiple\u201d and \u201cserious injuries\u201d. DHS, which has not identified either agent, said the injured officer who fired his weapon has been a member of Ice since 2021 and served in the military. DHS said it was the officer\u2019s first time firing his weapon in a \u201cuse of force incident\u201d.\n\n\u201cHis life was put at risk and he sustained serious injuries,\u201d posted Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary who visited Chicago for an immigration operation last week, on Twitter/X last week. Marcos Charles, the acting head of Ice\u2019s Enforcement and Removal Operations, told the AP on Friday that he had met with the officer in the hospital, saw his injuries and felt that the force used was appropriate. He declined further comment, saying there is an open investigation.\n\nDHS officials did not return messages on Tuesday.\n\nThe videos, from the perspective of multiple officers arriving on the scene, also show the two Ice agents performing chest compressions on an unresponsive man lying on the ground before other emergency personnel take over. Blood can be seen on the pavement.\n\nIce operations in Chicago, where federal officials have arrested more than 550 people, have drawn comparisons to the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown in Los Angeles earlier this summer. In Los Angeles, at least two people died while attempting to evade Ice: a farmworker who fell from a greenhouse roof during a raid and a man struck by an SUV while running from agents outside a Home Depot store.\n\nVillegas Gonz\u00e1lez, who worked as a cook, had just dropped off one of his children at daycare the morning of the shooting in the close-knit and largely Hispanic suburb of roughly 18,000 people. DHS said he had a history of reckless driving and did not have legal permission to live in the US.\n\nThe daycare\u2019s director described him as a good father while many Franklin Park residents came to vigils and remembered him as a kind family man.\n\nThe 38-year-old was from the state of Michoacan in western Mexico, according to the Consulate General of Mexico in Chicago, which said it would \u201cclosely monitor\u201d the investigation."

Authorities say Routh created a \u201csniper\u2019s nest\u201d near the sixth green of Trump International Golf Club, but never fired a shot at Trump.\n\nJurors deliberated for under three hours before delivering the guilty verdict.\n\nRouth will be sentenced on December 18 by Judge Aileen Cannon. He faces the possibility of life in prison.\n\nTrump took to social media after the verdict to congratulate law enforcement.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and the entire DOJ team on the conviction, in Florida, of the person who attempted an assassination on my life,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n\u201cThis was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him,\u201d the president added.\n\nUS attorneys rested their case on Friday after calling 38 witnesses. Nearly two weeks of testimony and hundreds of exhibits culminated with the final witness who pieced together how Routh was allegedly \u201cstalking\u201d Trump and collecting both \u201cphysical and electronic evidence.\u201d\n\nKimberly McGreevy, an FBI supervisory special agent, focused on evidence collected between August 14 and September 15, 2024, leading up to the alleged assassination attempt. Prosecutors ticked through a mountain of evidence with McGreevy on the stand, including call logs, text messages, bank records and video surveillance.\n\nHighlighting cellphone records allegedly from Routh\u2019s \u201cburner phones,\u201d the witness pointed to calls and text messages Routh allegedly made to arrange for the purchase of the rifle.\n\nThe FBI witness told the jury cellphone data showed Routh \u201cin the vicinity\u201d of the golf club for weeks before the incident, including on September 2 for 16 hours beginning at 4 a.m. A Google account on one of Routh\u2019s alleged \u201cburner phones\u201d showed he searched for \u201cTrump\u2019s upcoming rallies\u201d and \u201cPalm Beach traffic cameras,\u201d according to prosecutors.\n\nThe government also laid out Routh\u2019s alleged getaway plan: multiple license plates, three aliases, and Google searches for \u201cdirections to Miami airport\u201d and \u201cflights to Mexico.\u201d Text messages allegedly show he told a friend in Mexico, \u201cI may see you Monday,\u201d the day after his alleged plan to shoot Trump. Other searches online, prosecutors say, included \u201chospitals in the area\u201d and instructions on \u201chow to make a tourniquet.\u201d\n\nOn September 15, 2024, less than an hour before authorities say Routh was going to open fire on Trump, he texted his three children. His daughter Sarah at 12:55 p.m.: \u201cLove you so much, you are the best daughter.\u201d His son Adam at 12:56 p.m.: \u201cYou are so awesome dude, love you so much.\u201d His son Orin also at 12:56 p.m.: \u201cLove you so much, man. You are so brilliant.\u201d\n\nOrin, seemingly alarmed, wrote back: \u201cLove you too, Dad. What\u2019s up? Everything alright?\u201d\n\nRouth was arrested as he fled north on Florida\u2019s Interstate 95 about an hour later.\n\nEyewitness Tommy McGee also testified for the government. He told the jury he saw a \u201cfrantic and disheveled\u201d man leaving the scene and decided to follow him. He took pictures of his black Nissan Xterra and also wrote down his license plate. McGee alerted authorities, who stopped Routh\u2019s car about 45 minutes north on Highway 95. McGee was later brought to the scene to ID him.\n\nOn cross-examination, Routh told McGee, \u201cYou\u2019re a good man. You\u2019re my hero. You\u2019re an American hero.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi said the guilty verdict \u201cillustrates the Department of Justice\u2019s commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence. This attempted assassination was not only an attack on our President, but an affront to our very nation itself.\u201d\n\nClosing arguments center on intent\n\nDuring closing arguments Tuesday, both prosecutors and the defendant zeroed in on intent.\n\n\u201cEven though he didn\u2019t kill Trump, he wanted to,\u201d prosecutor Chris Browne told the jury.\n\nHe said Routh \u201cobsessively stalked and tracked his intended victim,\u201d and planned his alleged assassination attempt \u201cmeticulously and obsessively.\u201d\n\nThe defendant, delivering his own closing argument, claimed the assassination was \u201cnever going to happen.\u201d Routh said, \u201cIf the attempted assassination was not taken, it is not an attempt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no intent,\u201d he told the jury.\n\nRouth\u2019s closing was interrupted by Cannon at least 10 times as he veered into territory outside the bounds of evidence and charges. She told him to \u201cmove on\u201d numerous times.\n\nOn rebuttal, the prosecution reminded the jury that the crime does not have to be \u201ccompleted\u201d to convict of attempted assassination \u2013 \u201cnobody has to be shot,\u201d prosecutor John Shipley said.\n\nRouth\u2019s defense\n\nRouth had considered testifying in his own defense, but did call three witnesses, including two friends and a former Marine sniper, Michael McClay.\n\nMcClay told the jury that the SKS rifle authorities say they found at the scene jammed twice, after firing only one shot. The prosecutors disputed the weapon\u2019s capability during cross-examination, noting McClay had tested the weapon seven months after the incident at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. Prosecutors also noted by then, the weapon had been treated with acid to try and restore the serial number.\n\nWhen Routh\u2019s testimony veered into territory like his alleged drug use with his character witnesses, the judge jumped in, telling him, \u201cI\u2019ve given you substantial latitude. Drugs and cigarettes are not relevant here. I\u2019m going to ask you conclude the direct of this witness.\u201d\n\nAfter her father rested his case without testifying, Routh\u2019s daughter, Sarah, told CNN: \u201cI feel like he really didn\u2019t have another choice. After seeing how rigged it is, why would he put himself in that position, you know, that would be stupid. It\u2019s obviously all rigged and it\u2019s all bullsh*t.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s Hannah Rabinowitz and Alejandra Jaramillo contributed to this report."

Officers quickly swarmed him and dragged him out of the courthouse.\n\nJurors in Routh\u2019s trial returned a verdict of guilty on all charges after deliberating for less than three hours.\n\nThe government charged Routh, 59, with five criminal counts, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence and assaulting a Secret Service agent, after an incident on 15 September last year when he was spotted with a rifle hiding in bushes as Trump\u2019s golfing party approached.\n\nProsecutors said Routh, 59, had purchased a military-grade weapon, researched Trump\u2019s movements and utilized a dozen burner phones as part of a plot to kill Trump that was motivated by political grievances.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s guilty verdict against would-be Trump assassin Ryan Routh illustrates the Department of Justice\u2019s commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence,\u201d US attorney general Pam Bondi said in a statement on X.\n\n\u201cThis attempted assassination was not only an attack on our [now] president, but an affront to our very nation itself,\u201d Bondi added before thanking prosecutors and law enforcement for \u201cprotecting\u201d Trump and \u201csecuring this important verdict\u201d.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump thanked the attorney general, deputy Todd Blanche, and the justice department team for Routh\u2019s conviction, calling it \u201cmeticulously handled\u201d. He also thanked \u201cthe Judge and Jury for their time, professionalism, and patience\u201d, adding:\n\n\u201cThis was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him. I would also like to thank the Secret Service, Department of Florida Law Enforcement, and the wonderful person who spotted him running from the site of the crime, and acted by following him, and getting all information on car type and license plate to the Sheriff\u2019s Office, IMMEDIATELY, which led to his arrest and conviction.\n\n\u201cWhat incredible instinct and foresight this person had \u2013 A very big moment for JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\u201d\n\nRouth\u2019s attempt on Trump\u2019s life on 15 September 2024 came just nine weeks after the then presidential candidate narrowly survived a previous attempted assassination at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. In the earlier case, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks fired eight shots at Trump, with one bullet grazing his ear, before being killed by Secret Service counter-snipers, officials have said.\n\nAt the trial, Routh represented himself despite having no legal expertise. In court filings, he suggested his case should be settled by a golf match.\n\nIf Trump won, the president could execute Routh, the filing suggested. If Routh won, he said, he would become president.\n\nRouth also requested a putting green for match practice and asked for \u201cfemale strippers\u201d to be present.\n\nHis self-representation intermittently threatened to derail proceedings. The presiding judge, Aileen Cannon \u2013 who dismissed an unrelated case against Trump involving federal classified documents \u2013 advised Routh to keep his comments relevant after he remarked that \u201cmodern trials seem to eliminate all that is human\u201d. But Routh continued his musings on the \u201chistory\u201d of human existence.\n\nRouth was once a North Carolina construction worker who had moved to Hawaii and styled himself as a mercenary leader. He tried to recruit soldiers from Afghanistan, Moldova and Taiwan to fight the Russians in Ukraine.\n\nProsecutors said Routh made 17 trips to scope out Trump\u2019s golf course. Over the course of his two-week trial, prosecutors called 38 witnesses, including two bothers who testified about receiving a box from Routh five months earlier that contained wires, pipes and bullets.\n\nAfter investigators arrested Routh, the brothers said they opened the box to find a 12-page letter in which he wrote: \u201cThis was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, but I failed you. I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job.\u201d\n\nRouth ultimately was spotted by a Secret Service agent as he hid in nearby shrubbery while aiming a rifle at a member of Trump\u2019s security detail. An agent fired on Routh, who initially fled the scene but was later captured driving north.\n\nPolice later said the perimeter of the golf course was not fully secured as Trump was not an incumbent president and his visit was not scheduled. Routh was captured after a tipoff from a witness who had made a record of a license plate number of a car into which a man had jumped into after running out of the bushes.\n\nRouth chose not to testify in his own defense but instead called three witness, two of whom testified about his character. He told the court that he hoped they would show jurors he was incapable of killing Trump, who retook the Oval Office in January.\n\n\u201cGive it your worst,\u201d Routh told Cannon after she warned him about using character witnesses. \u201cWe can analyze every moment of my life. We are here to ascertain the truth \u2013 we are going to give the jury everything.\u201d\n\nHe called Marshall Hinshaw, a longtime friend, asking him if his \u201cpersonal opinion\u201d of Routh was that he was \u201cpeaceful and gentle, and nonviolent?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say so,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cI would not expect you to harm anyone, Ryan.\u201d\n\nRouth asked Hinshaw about his parenting style. \u201cYou are not aware of me hitting or spanking my children?\u201d Routh asked.\n\n\u201cNo, maybe the other way around,\u201d Hinshaw said. As the questioning continued, Cannon said: \u201cThis must cease. I am going to ask you to wrap up.\u201d She later warned that she would bar Routh from addressing the jury if his closing argument was \u201cdisconnected\u201d.\n\nRouth also called Michael McClay, a US Marine Corps veteran and expert in sniper tactics. McClay noted that Routh\u2019s rifle \u2013 a Chinese-made variant of the AK-47 \u2013 would routinely misfire and that its scope appeared to be attached with putty, tape and glue.\n\n\u201cIs there any way you could put a chance of success rate?\u201d Routh asked McClay. McClay replied: \u201cWith the severity and seriousness of this, I am not going to guess that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI respect that,\u201d Routh said.\n\nRouth\u2019s line of questioning went further astray when he asked McClay, \u201cIf someone is not dedicated to their mission 100%, is an exit plan vital to those who are cowards?\u201d\n\nMcClay answered: \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d"

Don\u2019t do anything. I\u2019ll get you out. He didn\u2019t hurt anybody,\u201d the daughter yelled.\n\nA few minutes later, Routh was brought back into the courtroom with shackles on. He wasn\u2019t wearing the jacket and tie from earlier and his white shirt didn\u2019t show signs of blood. The judge set his sentencing date for Dec. 18, where he will face up to life in prison.\n\nThe jurors took about two hours to find Routh, 59, guilty of five federal charges of attempted assassination, assault on a federal officer and gun crimes following a two week trial in Fort Pierce, Fla. court.\n\nAfter the verdict was read out, Routh took a pen and stabbed himself in the neck. The extent of his injuries was not immediately clear.\n\nTrump in a post on Truth Social later Tuesday thanked the judge and the jury for their \u201cprofessionalism, and patience,\u201d and thanked the Secret Service agent who stopped Routh for his \u201cinstinct and foresight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him,\u201d the post read. \u201cA very big moment for JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\u201d\n\nRouth \u2014 a construction worker, with no formal legal training \u2014 represented himself, putting on an amateur and bizarre defense in which he suggested the case should be settled by a golf match to the death.\n\nHe suggested that he and Trump face off on the green, and if Trump won, the president could execute Routh. If Routh won, he proposed, he would become president.\n\nSuch wild stunts led the judge to repeatedly slam Routh for running afoul of court rules.\n\nProsecutors said that Routh plotted for weeks before staking out the Trump International West Palm Beach golf course on Sept. 15, 2024 as Trump was golfing.\n\nRouth was spotted by a Secret Service agent as he was camped out an a sniper\u2019s nest on the edge of the course with an SKS rifle poking through the fence. The agent opened fire, prompting Routh to flee before he ever fired a shot.\n\nThe assassination attempt was the second in the span of nine weeks. Michael Thomas Crooks, 20, fired multiple rounds at Trump when he was campaigning in Butler, Pa. on July 13. One bullet grazed Trump\u2019s ear. Crooks was killed by a Secret Service counter sniper.\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, stopped Routh\u2019s opening statements after less than 10 minutes, following his rambling comments that touched on topics including prehistoric human history and world leaders including Nazi Germany dictator Adolf Hitler, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cThis case means absolutely nothing,\u201d Routh told jurors at one point. \u201cA life has been lived to the fullest.\u201d\n\nHe also tried to ask prospective panelists during jury selection about their stance on the US taking over Greenland, pro-Palestinian student activism and how they would react if a turtle crossed the road while they were driving. But Cannon blocked the questions, calling them \u201cirrelevant.\u201c\n\nRouth, who in recent years lived in Hawaii, fired his lawyers earlier this summer and was permitted by Cannon to take over his defense. But the judge warned Routh that his prior attorneys would do a better job than he would, and that he would only be allowed to consult with standby lawyers for technical legal questions and not for defense strategy.\n\nSince taking over, Routh has filed a slew of bonkers legal papers, including a witness list in which he sought to call the commander-in-chief himself, activist Mahmoud Khalil and a Secret Service agent he claimed asked him to \u201cspank/slap ass.\u201d\n\nMost of Routh\u2019s 24 proposed witnesses were barred by Cannon from testifying at trial on the grounds they couldn\u2019t offer relevant testimony.\n\nAt trial prosecutors called 38 law enforcement witnesses, including the Secret Service agent who foiled his plot, while Routh called just three \u2014 two character witnesses and one gun expert. Routh \u2014 who pleaded not guilty to all the charges \u2014 chose not to testify.\n\nIn earlier court filings, Routh asked why his case wasn\u2019t death-penalty eligible and asked to be traded in a prisoner exchange with Hamas, Iran, China and Russia. He also challenged Trump to a game of golf to the death, proposing that if he lost he should be executed and if Trump lost Routh should get his job.\n\nWith Post wires"

Despite his past achievements, Gundy's final seasons were marred by a series of losses, culminating in a 52-0 defeat to Colorado, and growing discontent among fans. Gundy's outspoken personality and controversial moments were part of his legacy, but the changing landscape of college football ultimately contributed to his departure.",
                "source": "cnn",
                "text": "Mike Gundy, one of college football\u2019s most colorful coaches over the last two decades, was fired by Oklahoma State on Tuesday.\n\nThe 58-year-old Gundy had a career record of 170-90 at his alma mater, where he was a star quarterback in the late 1980s. He posted winning records every season from 2006 to 2023, but had losing records in his final two years.\n\n\u201cCowboy Football reached an unprecedented level of success and national prominence under Coach Gundy\u2019s leadership,\u201d Oklahoma State athletic director Chad Weiberg said in a statement. \u201cI believe I speak for OSU fans everywhere when I say that we are grateful for all he did to raise the standard and show us all what is possible for Oklahoma State football.\u201d\n\nGundy arrived as head coach in 2005, and the Oklahoma City native\u2019s charm and sense of humor appealed to fans and recruits and helped the Cowboys compete with better-funded programs. As late billionaire T. Boone Pickens poured millions into the program, Gundy turned Oklahoma State into an unlikely powerhouse that often affected the national championship race. The Cowboys won the Big 12 in 2011 and played in the Big 12 title game in 2021 and 2023.\n\nBut the Cowboys couldn\u2019t keep up as college football changed. The transfer portal and NIL made it more difficult for a coach who made his name mining diamonds in the rough. Gundy lost 11 of his final 12 games with the program. In his final two seasons, he emerged as a refreshingly open and honest voice about the changes in the sport.\n\nOn Monday, Gundy said he wanted to stay.\n\n\u201cEver since I was hired, I\u2019ve put my heart and soul into this, and I\u2019ll continue to do that until I don\u2019t want to do it anymore, or until someone else says we don\u2019t want you to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nFor all his positives, Gundy came with quirks.\n\nHe is known as much for his \u201cI\u2019m a man, I\u2019m 40\u201d rant that he made defending a player \u2014 a diatribe that remains a part of pop culture through a Consumer Cellular commercial \u2014 as for his success.\n\nIn 2020, he apologized for calling Covid-19 the \u201cChinese Virus, \u201d and again months later, after he wore a T-shirt featuring the far-right One America News Network that created a disagreement with running back Chuba Hubbard.\n\nAll those things were forgiven as the team won. But the Cowboys lost their last nine games last season, the final defeat a 52-0 blowout at Colorado.\n\nThis season, Oklahoma State struggled out of the gate against FCS program Tennessee-Martin, winning 27-7 but raising eyebrows with its struggles after quarterback Hauss Hejny went down with a broken foot in the first quarter.\n\nThe next week, the Cowboys lost at Oregon 69-3. Ducks coach Dan Lanning said Gundy got his team fired up by talking about how much money Oregon had at its disposal.\n\nAfter a bye week, the Cowboys lost at home to Tulsa for the first time since 1951. The fans booed him during the loss to Tulsa, with some chanting \u201cFire Mike Gundy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to be angry at Coach Gundy, then you can do whatever you want that makes you feel better, but don\u2019t do it to the team,\u201d Gundy said on Monday. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s best for Oklahoma State football, Oklahoma State\u2019s athletic department and Oklahoma State in general.\u201d\n\nOklahoma State hosts Baylor on Saturday."

                "text": "By Ralph D. Russo, Bruce Feldman and Justin Williams\n\nOklahoma State announced Tuesday that Mike Gundy is out as head football coach, ending his 21-year head-coaching tenure after two of the worst losses of his career.\n\nFour days after the Cowboys lost 19-12 at home to Tulsa \u2014 their first loss in the series since 1998 \u2014 Oklahoma State decided to make a change it considered last December and parted ways with the winningest football coach in school history. The Cowboys (1-2) are also just two weeks removed from a 69-3 loss at Oregon that was the most lopsided ever under Gundy.\n\n\u201cThis was not something that I thought we would be doing today,\u201d athletic director Chad Weiberg said in a news conference Tuesday afternoon. \u201cI fully expected to beat the University of Tulsa. I expected the results of this season to be different than they\u2019ve been so far. When it appeared (those expectations) were not going to be met, I felt like for the good of the program, it was time to make this decision, so that we could start the process of getting the program where we want it to be.\u201d\n\nThe former Oklahoma State quarterback, who played with 1988 Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders, was 170-90 at his alma mater. Gundy spent 35 of the past 40 seasons as a player, assistant or head coach at the school. As head coach, he won one Big 12 title and had just two losing seasons \u2014 his first (2005) and last (2024) full year in charge. The end of Gundy\u2019s tenure also came 18 years and one day after he went off on a newspaper columnist by exclaiming, \u201cCome after me: I\u2019m a man! I\u2019m 40!\u201d \u2014 an iconic rant that this year he recreated for a TV commercial for a cell phone company.\n\nGundy survived a standoff with school administrators after a 3-9 record in 2024 that included a winless Big 12 season. Gundy agreed to make staff changes and took a $1 million pay cut, but he kept the job he has held since 2005. His restructured contract called for a $15 million buyout.\n\n\u201cIt will come out of our revenues, our operating budget,\u201d Weiberg said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not a small amount of money, especially today when we\u2019re trying to do revenue sharing and all of those things. But it is just part of it, and we will honor our contractual obligations.\u201d\n\nWeiberg said that he met with Gundy to inform him of the decision Tuesday morning and that the possibility of Gundy staying on for the remainder of the season was not discussed. The Cowboys are next scheduled to host Baylor at 3:30 p.m. ET on Saturday. Offensive coordinator Doug Meacham will serve as interim coach.\n\nDuring his regularly scheduled Monday news conference, Gundy had been asked whether he has had any recent conversations with university administrators about the future.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think that there has to be a conversation. I can honestly say no,\u201d Gundy said Monday. \u201cBut I think that (the administration) shares a same vision that I have. And I think that maybe the conversation hasn\u2019t really had to take place because I\u2019ve been here for 21 years, and I think they know what\u2019s on my mind and I probably have a pretty good feel for what they want. So I don\u2019t really know that needs to take place.\u201d\n\nAsked if anyone from the university had been in contact with an agent or representative of his at the time, Gundy said: \u201cI haven\u2019t had an agent in a long time.\u201d\n\nA pivotal season for the brash and sometimes defiant 58-year-old started with a routine victory against UT Martin, an FCS school, but the trip to Oregon looked ominous, and Gundy\u2019s comments leading up to the game only served to draw attention to it.\n\nGundy said that while Oklahoma State had spent about $7 million over the previous three seasons on name, image and likeness compensation for players, \u201cI think Oregon spent close to ($40 million) last year alone. Now, I might be off a few million.\u201d Gundy then suggested teams might be better off only playing nonconference opponents with similar budgets. Ducks coach Dan Lanning responded that at Oregon they \u201cspend to win.\u201d\n\nThe Ducks scored two touchdowns within the first two minutes of the game and led 42-3 at halftime. The only losses in Oklahoma State history that were worse were 67-0 to Oklahoma in 1907 and 75-0 to the Sooners in 1904.\n\nThe bottom has fallen out quickly for Gundy\u2019s program. Just two seasons ago, Oklahoma State made a surprising run to the Big 12 title game, the Cowboys\u2019 second conference championship appearance in three years.\n\nThat came after Gundy ran into controversy in 2020, when he wore a shirt bearing the logo of right-wing news outlet OAN (One America News) that briefly seemed to put him at odds with some of his players.\n\nGundy seemed to make a habit of having his teams rise when expectations were low, but doubters started speculating whether he was slipping.\n\nDuring his two decades in Stillwater, Gundy turned Oklahoma State into a consistent winner and Big 12 contender, though he rarely was able to get past rival Oklahoma. Gundy went 4-14 against the Sooners but still pushed the Cowboys to their greatest heights, including the 2011 Big 12 title. That team finished 12-1 and ranked No. 3 in the country and had a case to play in the BCS Championship Game.\n\nAt the peak of his career, Gundy was courted by Arkansas, Tennessee and others, but the Oklahoma native stayed put and became synonymous with Oklahoma State.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never, ever, become a time that I haven\u2019t wanted to come to work and pour my heart and soul into what I do for the players,\u201d Gundy said Monday.\n\nGundy became the third major college football coach fired before the end of the September. UCLA fired DeShaun Foster and Virginia Tech let go of Brent Pry after Week 3. Like Oklahoma State, those Power 4 schools made the move just days after their teams lost at home to Group of 5 programs.\n\nGundy was the second-longest tenured active head coach in the Football Bowl Subdivision, behind Iowa\u2019s Kirk Ferentz (27 seasons) and tied with Utah\u2019s Kyle Whittingham.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to continuing to celebrate Coach Gundy and his accomplishments,\u201d Weiberg said. \u201cThere will be a time and place soon for that to happen here. We are very appreciative of everything he has done for this place, this university and this program.\u201d\n\n(Photo: Stacy Revere / Getty Images)"

The figures include ejections for derogatory comments, throwing equipment while protesting calls and inappropriate conduct.\n\nBig league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.\n\n\u201cThroughout this process we have worked on deploying the system in a way that\u2019s acceptable to players,\u201d commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \u201cThe strong preference from players for the challenge format over using the technology to call every pitch was a key factor in determining the system we are announcing today.\u201d\n\nABS, which utilizes Hawk-Eye cameras, has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019. The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that\u2019s year Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.\n\nAt Triple-A at the start of the 2023 season, half the games used the robots for ball/strike calls and half had a human making decisions subject to appeals by teams to the ABS.\n\nMLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182) challenges.\n\nAt Triple-A this season, the average challenges per game increased to 4.2 from 3.9 through Sunday and the success rate dropped to 49.5% from 50.6%. Defenses were successful in 53.7% of challenges this year and offenses in 45%.\n\nIn the first test at the big League All-Star Game, four of five challenges of plate umpire Dan Iassogna\u2019s calls were successful in July.\n\nTeams in Triple-A do not get additional challenges in extra innings. The proposal approved Tuesday included a provision granting teams one additional challenge each inning if they don\u2019t have challenges remaining.\n\nMLB has experimented with different shapes and interpretations of the strike zone with ABS, including versions that were three-dimensional. Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.\n\nThis will be MLB\u2019s first major rule change since sweeping adjustments in 2024. Those included a pitch clock, restrictions on defensive shifts, pitcher disengagements such as pickoff attempts and larger bases.\n\nThe challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers, and there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete. Not that everyone loves it.\n\n\u201cThe idea that people get paid for cheating, for stealing strikes, for moving a pitch that\u2019s not a strike into the zone to fool the official and make it a strike is beyond my comprehension,\u201d former manager Bobby Valentine said.\n\nTexas manager Bruce Bochy, a big league catcher from 1978-87, maintained old-school umpires such as Bruce Froemming and Billy Williams never would have accepted pitch framing. He said they would have told him: \u201c\u2019If you do that again, you\u2019ll never get a strike.\u2019 I\u2019m cutting out some words.\u201d\n\nManagement officials on the competition committee include Seattle chairman John Stanton, St. Louis CEO Bill DeWitt Jr., San Francisco chairman Greg Johnson, Colorado CEO Dick Monfort, Toronto CEO Mark Shapiro and Boston chairman Tom Werner.\n\nPlayers include Arizona\u2019s Corbin Burnes and Zac Gallen, Detroit\u2019s Casey Mize, Seattle\u2019s Cal Raleigh and the New York Yankees\u2019 Austin Slater, with the Chicago Cubs\u2019 Ian Happ at Detroit\u2019s Casey Mize as alternates.

                "text": "The robot umps are here.\n\nMajor League Baseball\u2019s competition committee on Tuesday afternoon approved the introduction of the automated ball-strike system, or ABS, for the 2026 regular season. Every team will begin next year\u2019s games with two challenges of the home plate umpire\u2019s strike zone, and a team will not lose one of its challenges when it gets the challenge right. When a challenge is issued, the umpire will review how a high-tech camera system called the pitch, and that determination will be final.\n\nMLB has been testing ABS in Triple A since 2022, and tried out the system in major-league spring training for the first time in 2025. The system\u2019s introduction for 2026 has been expected for months, ever since commissioner Rob Manfred said in June he likely would propose ABS to the committee. Manfred and MLB ultimately have control over the committee\u2019s decisions; per the collective bargaining agreement with the players, the league office has six appointees on the 11-person committee, the players have four, and the umpires have one.\n\n\u201cThe previous rule changes that have been adopted by the Joint Competition Committee have had staying power and created momentum for the game,\u201d Manfred said in a statement. \u201cWe used the same process with ABS that started with listening to fans, conducting extensive testing at the minor league level, and trying at every step to make the game better. Throughout this process we have worked on deploying the system in a way that\u2019s acceptable to players.\u201d\n\nChallenges can be issued only by the players directly involved with a given pitch: the pitcher, catcher and batter. Managers cannot issue one, and players are forbidden from receiving any help from others in issuing the challenge. The request has to be made immediately after the pitch.\n\nIn spring training this year, 288 games were played with ABS and they saw an average of 4.1 challenges per game, the league said in its news release. Calls were overturned 52.2 percent of the time, and challenges added 13.8 per seconds on average. Catchers had the greatest success overturning pitches at 56 percent of the time, compared to 50 percent for hitters and 41 percent for pitchers.\n\nFull counts prompted challenges in spring training more than any other count. Players challenged least often on 3-0. But the higher leverage the count, the less successful the challenges were.\n\nIn its testing processes in the minors, MLB looked at an implementation of ABS on every pitch, but decided this challenge system, as it\u2019s referred to, was the best choice.\n\nAt least one player appointee to the committee, however, opposed the rule change Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe vote of the players on the committee was not unanimous, which was reflective of the broad player sentiment,\u201d the Players Association said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nAt the All-Star Game, MLBPA head Tony Clark expressed concern over teams getting the closest of calls reversed and wondered whether a buffer zone should be considered. Manfred said at the time that was not on the table.\n\nThere\u2019s one change from the way MLB tested the system during spring training: Every team will have at least one challenge at the beginning of each individual extra inning that is played. So if a team has exhausted both of its challenges in the first nine innings, it will receive an extra one to start the 10th. But a team will not receive an extra one if it still possesses one or two.\n\nThe MLBPA reps on the committee have often voted against rule changes MLB has proposed during this CBA, which dates to 2022. Many of the changes Manfred has pushed through have worked out well, however, most notably the pitch clock, which was introduced in 2023. The union reps sometimes oppose changes not because they disapprove of the whole concept of a given rule, but because there are some parts of the rule they disagree with.\n\n\u201cThe strong preference from players for the challenge format over using the technology to call every pitch was a key factor in determining the system we are announcing today,\u201d Manfred continued in his statement. \u201cI commend the Joint Competition Committee for striking the right balance of preserving the integral role of the umpire in the game with the ability to correct a missed call in a high-leverage situation, all while preserving the pace and rhythm of the game.\u201d\n\n(Top photo of an ABS challenge during the 2025 MLB All-Star Game: Matthew Grimes Jr. / Atlanta Braves / Getty Images)"

Other clinics in Tal al-Hawa and the Shati refugee camp have also been destroyed or besieged.\n\nHind Khoudary, reporting for Al Jazeera from az-Zawayda, described the devastation: \u201cThe situation continues to deteriorate, especially in the heart of Gaza City, where Israeli forces have been using artillery shelling and quadcopters to push more Palestinians to evacuate to the south and central areas.\n\n\u201cThere have been endless appeals from Palestinian families saying their relatives are stuck under the rubble, but no one can reach them.\u201d\n\nNo safe zones\n\nTens of thousands of Palestinians fleeing Gaza City have ended up in the central and southern areas of the enclave, which are under constant bombardment. The Israeli-designated \u201csafe zone\u201d of al-Mawasi has itself been attacked repeatedly, with health officials warning that it lacks the basic necessities of life, including water, food [and] health services, while disease spreads through overcrowded camps.\n\nExperts say the forced movement is itself part of the machinery of genocide: driving families into displacement under fire and stripping them of shelter, food and dignity.\n\nAt Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis, doctors report that three Palestinians were shot and killed by Israeli forces near the supposed safe zone further south. Three children died from malnutrition in southern Gaza, according to hospital sources.\n\nIn August, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification declared that famine was under way in northern Gaza and would spread south. Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health warns that hospitals are now \u201centering an extremely dangerous phase\u201d due to fuel shortages.\n\nThis collapse of health services and the deliberate obstruction of food and fuel deliveries has led to UN experts accusing Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.\n\nWest Bank under attack\n\nWhile global attention remains fixed on the destruction in Gaza, events in the occupied West Bank may carry even deeper implications for the future of the conflict.\n\nIsrael has threatened to accelerate annexation plans in the West Bank in the wake of recognition of Palestinian statehood by several Western countries, including France and the United Kingdom.\n\nOn the ground, violence has intensified. Armed settlers shot dead Saeed Murad al-Nasan in the village of al-Mughayyir, north of Ramallah, Al Jazeera Arabic reported.\n\nIsraeli forces raided multiple towns around Nablus and ordered the indefinite closure of the King Hussein (Allenby) Bridge, the only gateway for goods and people between the West Bank and Jordan.\n\nThe tightening of settlements, killings and closure of borders are not isolated incidents. Together, they form part of what a UN report on Tuesday described as a systematic effort to secure permanent Israeli control over Gaza and entrench a Jewish majority in the West Bank.\n\nIt comes after a UN commission concluded last week that Israel\u2019s policies \u2013 forced displacement, denial of return, destruction of infrastructure and the deliberate use of starvation as a weapon \u2013 meet the legal definition of genocide."

The crowd then praises Hamas's armed wing, the Qassam Brigades.\n\nA Palestinian security official from the Hamas-run Gaza government told Reuters that the executions were carried out by the \"Joint Operations Room of the Palestinian resistance\".\n\nThis is a rare instance in which a public execution in Gaza has been captured on video. There have been previous reports of Hamas using violence on those who dissent. In May, Hamas-led groups reportedly executed four Palestinians for looting aid trucks.\n\nIn Sunday's footage, one armed man singles out Yasser Abu Shabab as a \"major collaborator\" who they seek to kill.\n\nAbu Shabab is major figurehead of a clan which has reportedly been armed by the Israeli government. It has been operating in Rafah, in an area under Israeli military control. The group has presented itself as an opposition force to Hamas.\n\nIn July Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was arming clans in Gaza that he said were opposed to Hamas. However, Yasser Abu Shabab posted online to \"categorically reject\" that Israel had supplied his group's weapons.\n\nThat same month, a senior officer in Hamas's security forces told the BBC that the Palestinian armed group had lost much of its control over the Gaza Strip and that armed clans were filling the void.\n\nAbu Shabab's armed group has been advertising for recruits on social media, Reuters reported. The news agency quoted residents and sources close to Hamas as saying that other groups opposed to Hamas had also emerged in parts of northern Gaza and near Khan Younis in southern Gaza.\n\nIsraeli troops meanwhile have continued to operate in Gaza City. The Israeli military said troops had \"dismantled military infrastructure used by Hamas\" and killed a Hamas cell that had attacked Israeli soldiers, wounding an officer.\n\nIt has said its objectives are to free the hostages still held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it has described as the group's \"main stronghold\".\n\nHowever, the offensive on Gaza's biggest urban area, where one million people were living and a famine was confirmed last month, has drawn widespread international condemnation.\n\nLast week a spokeswoman for the UN's humanitarian office said she had seen a constant stream of Palestinians heading south during a recent visit to the city, but that hundreds of thousands remained in the city. She described the situation in the city as \"cataclysmic\".\n\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nAt least 65,344 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

                "article_summary": "Approximately 160 countries have recognized a Palestinian state, with the UK, France, Canada, and Australia joining recently, yet the realization of this state is hindered by US opposition and Israeli resistance. The recognition is seen as a diplomatic effort to revive the two-state solution amidst the ongoing violence in Gaza, with leaders acknowledging that the path to a viable Palestinian state is currently remote. Additionally, European nations are linking recognition to reforms within the Palestinian Authority and the exclusion of Hamas, while the US maintains a supportive stance towards Israel and its military actions.",
                "source": "cnn",
                "text": "Some 160 states have signed up to recognize a Palestinian state. In the last week, the United Kingdom, France, Canada and Australia have done so, but the prospect of it becoming a reality amid US opposition and Israeli resistance is at best a distant one.\n\nWhat does recognizing a Palestinian state mean in reality; is it just a gesture?\n\nIn reality, the recognition of a Palestinian state is a diplomatic declaration aimed at rescuing the vision of a two-state solution that would settle decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said this weekend that it was the path toward creating a viable Palestinian state co-existing with a secure Israel. But he and other leaders admit that such a vision is at the moment very distant in the face of Israel\u2019s adamant refusal to accept any form of Palestinian statehood.\n\nWhy are countries doing this now?\n\nIt is largely a reaction to events in Gaza and the ongoing Israeli military campaign to push the territory\u2019s civilian population into an ever-shrinking patch of land. French President Emmanuel Macron said in July his urgent priority was to end the conflict in Gaza and to break the cycle of violence. \u201cWe must finally build the State of Palestine, ensure its viability and enable it, by accepting its demilitarisation and fully recognising Israel, to contribute to the security of all in the Middle East,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are also internal dynamics in several European countries, where there have been large pro-Palestinian rallies and where public opinion has swung against Israel in light of the destruction and starvation in Gaza. Several of these countries also have large Muslim populations. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Tuesday: \u201cIt really is them responding to their own domestic politics, you know, protesters in their streets and things like that.\u201d\n\nWhat is the US position?\n\nEchoing Israel\u2019s own position, the Trump administration has said that recognizing a Palestinian state rewards terrorism \u2013 a position repeated by US President Donald Trump himself at the UN General Assembly. Rubio said in July that Macron\u2019s decision was \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cserves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace. It is a slap in the face to the victims of October 7th,\u201d he said. The US has been more supportive than many western governments of Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza and has not publicly opposed Israeli plans to expand settlements in the occupied West Bank. It would veto any attempt at the UN Security Council to recognize a Palestinian state.\n\nWhat conditions are some countries placing?\n\nEuropean governments and others say that recognition is part of a longer-term process, which will include reform of the Palestinian Authority and fresh elections no later than a year after a ceasefire in Gaza. When it joined moves to recognize a Palestinian state, Australia noted that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas had restated recognition of Israel\u2019s right to exist and made \u201ccommitments to hold democratic elections and enact significant reform to finance, governance and education.\u201d Governments recognizing a Palestinian state have said Hamas must have no role in it. A declaration by 27 states in July, including many in the Arab world, said that \u201cHamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, with international engagement and support, in line with the objective of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State.\u201d Starmer and others have said that a Palestinian state must be demilitarized.\n\nWho would lead it?\n\nOne of many unknowns. Abbas, the current president of the Palestinian Authority, is 89 years old. In April he named confidant Hussein al-Sheikh as his deputy and likely successor, marking the first time he has ever had an official number two. Sheikh, born in 1960, is a veteran of Fatah, the main PLO faction which was founded by Yasser Arafat. But the PA has lost support among Palestinians due to widespread corruption and a perception that it is ineffective in the face of growing Israeli incursions in the West Bank. Opinion polls show that despite more than 20 years in Israeli jails, 66-year-old Marwan Barghouti is the most popular figure among Palestinians. But Israel has vowed to keep him in prison. He was convicted of planning attacks that led to five Israeli civilians being killed.\n\nDoes it help achieve a two-state solution?\n\nStarmer admitted over the weekend that a two-state solution hung by a thread. \u201cHope of a two-state solution is fading, but we cannot let that light go out,\u201d he said. The US is the only government capable of influencing Israel to rethink and there are no signs that it intends to. Israel\u2019s occupation of much of Gaza and its discussions about plans to extend sovereignty over parts of the West Bank through annexation mean that facts on the ground render a two-state solution an even more distant prospect. Those plans are being pushed hard by far-right ministers in Israel\u2019s coalition, even as some 160 countries back the creation of an independent Palestine."

It\u2019s only the beginning.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Arab and Muslim leaders are set to meet Donald Trump in New York to discuss their separate plan for a stabilisation force in Gaza as France joined the UK, Canada and Australia in recognising Palestine as a state.\n\nThe recognition of Palestine by France and five other states played out in dramatic fashion later on the floor of the UN general assembly as France and Saudi Arabia co-chaired a summit to discuss the future of a two-state solution, a road map to peace that Benjamin Netanyahu has declared a dead-end.\n\nOn Monday night Monaco, Belgium, Andorra, Malta and Luxembourg all recognised Palestine, bringing the total number of recognitions to three-quarters of UN membership.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said in a speech that statehood was a \u201cright, not a reward\u201d for Palestinians.\n\n\u201cNothing can justify the horrific 7 October terror attacks by Hamas or the taking of hostages,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, derided the session as an \u201cembarrassing political circus\u201d and the US has warned its allies that the recognition of Palestine could lead to a \u201creciprocal\u201d Israeli reaction, setting the scene for a major diplomatic crisis as world leaders meet in New York for the 80th anniversary of the UN.\n\nIsrael has warned that it might respond to the recognition of Palestine by annexing the West Bank, citing claims from Hamas that recognition by allies of Israel was a victory for the terror group.\n\n\u201cNothing can also excuse developments in the West Bank that pose an existential threat to a two-state solution,\u201d said Guterres. \u201cThe relentless expansion of settlements, the creeping threat of annexation, the intensification of settler violence \u2013 all of it must stop.\u201d\n\nFrance has said the plan for a stabilisation force would marginalise Hamas by disarming the group and excluding it from power.\n\nThe proposal includes a UN-mandated force to provide security in Gaza as well as oversee the disarmament of Hamas and help train a PA police force.\n\nThe diplomatic scramble played out in New York as Israel intensified its assault on Gaza City on Monday, with reports of 37 Palestinians killed across the territory, including 30 in Gaza City. Israel launched an offensive in the city last week against what it said were 3,000 Hamas fighters hiding in the city, ignoring international humanitarian concerns.\n\nThe Arab League declared in July that Hamas must play no further role in governance, with power handed to a newly elected PA to govern Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Hamas would be required to hand over its weapons to the authority.\n\nThe Trump meeting, scheduled after his address to the UN\u2019s general assembly, is the most direct engagement between the White House and Arab states on post-ceasefire plans for Gaza since he was elected president for a second time.\n\nTrump is expected to deliver an aggressive speech decrying \u201cglobalist institutions\u201d on Tuesday, which he will claim have \u201chave significantly decayed the world order\u201d, a White House spokesperson said in a briefing.\n\nThe US president is also expected to meet leaders from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Nothing the president has done so far suggests that he shares the view held by the Gulf states that the PA is a viable alternative to Hamas, or should be considered a partner for peace. He has imposed sanctions on PA officials and banned Mahmoud Abbas, its 89-year-old leader, from coming to New York to speak to the UN. Abbas, addressing the summit virtually, commended the 149 nations that had already recognised a Palestinian state, and called on Hamas to surrender its weapons to the PA, adding: \u201cWe also condemn the killing and detention of civilians, including Hamas actions on October 7 2023.\u201d\n\nArab leaders see the meeting as a chance to pin down Trump on whether he supports the Arab League\u2019s proposals for Gaza\u2019s future, or even a variation put to him by a working group led by Tony Blair, the former UK prime minister, and Jared Kushner, who is the president\u2019s son-in-law. Neither of the reconstruction plans proposes the mass expulsion of Palestinians, a proposal that Trump at times has appeared to support. The Blair plan does not clearly endorse the PA as the long-term administrators for Gaza.\n\nThe Arab states are likely to insist they will not join any international force unless the reformed PA is given a future role. They also want a roadmap to a two-state future that excludes further Israeli settlements or annexation of the West Bank.\n\nThe UK on Sunday recognised a Palestinian state provisionally based on the 1949 armistice border, or \u201cGreen Line\u201d, between Israel, the West Bank and Gaza before their 1967 capture.\n\nThe PA, which exercises limited civic rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and was forced out of Gaza by Hamas in 2007, has said it was ready to govern Gaza and the West Bank with international support.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, has insisted that Israel must retain overall security control alongside an Arab-led civilian administration. However, others in his rightwing coalition want to annex Gaza. Israel has driven the PA close to bankruptcy by withholding monthly revenue transfers.\n\nLana Nusseibeh, a minister at the UAE foreign affairs ministry, said annexation would be a red line for the UAE since \u201cit would strike at the heart of what the Abraham accords are trying to achieve\u201d. The UAE signed the accords \u2013 deals brokered by Trump to normalise relations between Israel and the Arab states \u2013 in 2020 in return for Israel not annexing the West Bank.\n\nUAE leaders, bidding to present themselves as the startup nation of the future, did not suggest they would leave the accords but instead said plans for greater regional integration would become a dead letter.\n\nThe UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, urged Israel not to respond to the new recognitions by annexing parts of the West Bank, saying \u201csettler expansion threatens the very viability of a Palestinian state\u201d.\n\nCooper condemned violence on both sides, citing \u201ccontinued bloodshed, manmade famine, terrorism and hostage-taking, settlement expansion and settler violence\u201d and warned that \u201cthe two-state solution risks disappearing beneath the rubble \u2013 that is what extremists on both sides want\u201d.\n\nShe echoed others in saying Hamas could have no future in the governance of Palestine.\n\nFrance\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, said the recognition of a Palestinian state was a disavowal of Hamas since the plan called for its exclusion from any future role in the governance of Gaza. He pointed out that the general assembly had already endorsed a seven-page declaration this month outlining \u201ctangible, timebound, and irreversible steps\u201d toward a two-state solution, while also condemning Hamas and calling for it to surrender and disarm.\n\nThe German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said: \u201cAny and all steps toward an illegal annexation of occupied territory also undermine the chances of resolving the conflict in a sustainable way. However distant it may seem at this moment, a negotiated two-state solution is the path that can enable both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace, security and dignity. Germany regards recognition of a Palestinian state as a step more at the end of the process. However, such a process must now begin.\u201d"

I want to make it clear that for me, it was based on who I believe should be in the commissioner chair on New South Wales\u2019 worst day, and when the public\u2019s in danger, and the New South Wales police force needs exceptional leadership.\n\nHe\u2019s led the Reconstruction Authority. He\u2019s had the most difficult command in the New South Wales police, not just for one year or two years, but for over a decade.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 19.56 EDT\n\nNew NSW police commissioner says he takes on role with \u2018deep sense of duty\u2019\n\nJordyn Beazley\n\nMal Lanyon appeared before the media a short time ago after it was announced, after weeks of speculation, that he would be next New South Wales police commissioner.\n\nStanding alongside the NSW premier, Chris Minns, and the state police minister, Yasmin Catley, Lanyon said:\n\nThis is one of the greatest responsibilities in the public service, and I take it on with humility and a deep sense of duty.\n\nI acknowledge Commissioner Karen Webb for her distinguished 38-year career in the police force. She leaves a legacy of achievement as the first woman to lead the New South Wales Police forces and as a commissioner who delivered enduring reforms.\n\nLanyon said he will be focus on tackling organised crime, youth crime and \u201cstrengthening community safety in our regions, and supporting victims of domestic and family violence\u201d.\n\nI also want to strengthen the culture of the New South Wales police force, [and] cultivate a culture of respect, professionalism and fairness.\n\nI want every officer, every member of the executive [to be] part of one team, united behind the force\u2019s goals, motivated by purpose and community.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 19.41 EDT\n\nNino Bucci\n\nVictorian police say family violence increases during AFL grand final weekends\n\nFamily violence reports increase on the AFL grand final weekend, but there was no increase on the day of the game itself.\n\nFamily Violence Command acting assistant commissioner Sharon McKinnon said there was a 9% increase in family violence incidents over the grand final long weekend in September last year compared with 2023.\n\nThere were 796 family violence incidents during the three-day long weekend, up from 729 incidents the year before.\n\nBut the number of family violence incidents on the actual day of the game for the past five years has remained consistent, with no apparent increase. McKinnon said:\n\nThe Christmas, New Year and Easter periods remain the most prevalent times for family violence offending.\n\nOur key message is that police will take all reports of family violence crime seriously and will always respond to keep victims safe and hold perpetrators to account.\n\nPolice will always continue to work through peak holiday periods to provide safety to the community.\n\nThere is never an excuse for family violence and police will ensure that each crime is investigated and that all offenders are held to account.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 19.20 EDT\n\nActing NSW police commissioner says Mal Lanyon a \u2018highly accomplished and respected leader\u2019\n\nAs reported earlier, Mal Lanyon has been named the new commissioner of the NSW police force, succeeding Karen Webb.\n\nPeter Thurtell, the acting commissioner of the force, said in a statement this morning:\n\nCommissioner-elect Lanyon is a highly accomplished and respected leader, bringing more than 37 years of policing experience to the role. His dedication to public service and his deep understanding of the challenges facing modern policing make him exceptionally well-suited to lead the NSW police force into its next chapter.\n\nThe NSW police force is in safe hands. Under Commissioner-elect Lanyon\u2019s leadership, we can move forward with confidence to meet the challenges ahead and continue delivering for the people of New South Wales.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 18.56 EDT\n\nGambling evolution making it harder to monitor how many people gamble\n\nLiz Neville, the director of the Australian Institute of Family Studies, said the study shows the gambling industry is rapidly evolving, making it harder to monitor how many people are participating and facing gambling harm.\n\nNeville spoke to RN Breakfast this morning:\n\nI think it tells us that the gambling industry in all its forms \u2013 and bearing in mind that the survey covered things ranging from lotteries, bingo, scratchies, pokies, race betting, sports betting, the full gamut of gambling activities \u2013 I think what it tells us is that this is a rapidly evolving industry.\n\nAnd there\u2019s many forms and types of activities that are emerging that we are having trouble, I think, keeping up with from a purely conventional approach to monitoring of gambling participation and harm.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 18.46 EDT\n\nMore Australians gambling every month, research says\n\nHenry Belot\n\nThe number of Australians gambling and the prevalence of harm has increased, with nearly one-third of adults betting each month, according to new research from the Australian Institute of Family Studies.\n\nThe survey of 3,881 people in 2024 has prompted the institute\u2019s director, Liz Neville, to call for \u201ca more robust approach\u201d to preventing gambling harm, including a careful examination of current policies.\n\nThe government is yet to respond to a landmark parliamentary inquiry in June 2023, which recommended several policy changes including a comprehensive ban on advertising and the creation of a more powerful national regulator.\n\nThe study found 65% of adults gambled at least once a year, which was an 8 percentage point increase on the data recorded in 2019. It found 15% experienced guilt or stress about their gambling and sold possessions to help chase their losses.\n\nThe Australian Gambling Research Centre\u2019s research fellow, Dr Gabriel Tillman, said the findings confirmed the increasingly negative impact of wagering.\n\nThe fact that more than 3 million Australian adults are experiencing harms from their gambling, and these numbers have increased in recent years despite harm-reduction measures should concern Australians.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 18.36 EDT\n\nTom McIlroy\n\nAustralia\u2019s bid to host the COP31 climate talks in Adelaide this year still a work in progress\n\nAnthony Albanese and the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, are seeking to press the case to host the COP31 climate talks with Turkey during their visit to New York this week.\n\nBowen met his counterpart, Murat Kurum, on the sidelines of the UN summit and the prime minister is seeking a meeting with Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in coming days.\n\nAlbanese said he wanted to make the case for the Pacific to host the talks in conjunction with Australia. Turkey also wants to host, so unless a compromise can be reached, the summit will default to Bonn in Germany.\n\n\u201cThe Pacific is important,\u201d Albanese said on Wednesday morning, Australian time.\n\nOne of the things that\u2019s complicated is it is a joint bid by Australia and the Pacific, so any arrangements we will discuss with our Pacific neighbours, as we have been.\n\nI\u2019ve already had discussions with a range of Pacific leaders who are here as well. I will be having discussions with President Erdogan as well.\n\nThe prime minister did not say when he would speak to the Turkish leader but he still has a number of bilateral meetings before leaving the US.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 18.21 EDT"

                "text": "41 minutes ago\n\nRuth Comerford and\n\nAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said Kyiv can \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\", marking a major shift in his position on the war with Russia.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform, he said Ukraine could get back \"the original borders from where this war started\" with the support of Europe and Nato, due to pressures on Russia's economy.\n\nHis comments came after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, held after Trump had addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on Tuesday.\n\nTrump has repeatedly expressed his desire to end the war, but has previously warned that process would likely involve Ukraine giving up some territory, an outcome Zelensky has consistently rejected.\n\nIn his post, Trump added Ukraine could \"maybe even go further than that\", but did not specify what he was referring to.\n\nHe also made no reference to Crimea, which was invaded and annexed by Russia in 2014. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nTrump said his position had changed \"after getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia military and economic situation\".\n\n\"Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act,\" he added, labelling Russia as a \"paper tiger\".\n\nZelensky hailed the \"big shift\" in Trump's position, and speaking to reporters in the UN building, said he understood the US was willing to give Ukraine security guarantees \"after the war is finished\".\n\nPressed on what this would look like, he added: \"I don't want to lie, we don't have specific details,\" but broached the possibility of more weapons, air defences and drones.\n\nSpeaking later on Fox News, Zelensky said that Trump's Truth Social post about Ukraine's positioning surprised him but he took it as a \"positive signal\" that Trump and the US \"will be with us to the end of the war\".\n\n\"I think the fact that Putin was lying to President Trump so many times also made a difference between us,\" he told Fox host Bret Baier.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, following his speech to the UN, Trump also said Nato nations should shoot down Russian planes breaching their airspace, following a series of recent incursions by Russian fighter jets and drones.\n\nLast week, Estonia and Poland requested a consultation with other Nato members after Russia violated its airspace in separate incidents. Romania, another Nato member, also said Russian drones breached its airspace.\n\nAfter meeting on Tuesday, Nato issued a statement condemning Russia's actions and warned that it would use \"all necessary military and non-military tools\" to defend itself.\n\n\"Russia bears full responsibility for these actions, which are escalatory, risk miscalculation and endanger lives. They must stop,\" it said.\n\nThe alliance added that Moscow's actions were part of a \"pattern of increasingly irresponsible\" behaviour.\n\nNato's secretary general Mark Rutte said: \"We are a defensive alliance, yes, but we are not naive, so we see what is happening.\"\n\nSpeaking at the UN, Poland's president Karol Nawrocki echoed those comments, saying his country was prepared to \"defend its territory\" and \"react adequately\".\n\n\"Polish people, as well as countries of Central and Eastern Europe, will not be scared of Russian drones,\" he said.\n\nRussia denied violating Estonia's airspace, while it insisted the Polish incursion was not deliberate and did not comment on the Romania incident.\n\nAsked if the US would support its Nato allies if they shot down Russian aircraft, Trump said it \"depends on the circumstance\" and praised the military alliance for increasing defence spending.\n\n\"Nato has stepped up,\" he said, referring to an agreement by leaders to ramp up defence spending to 5% of their countries' economic output by 2035.\n\nIn his speech hours earlier, Trump criticised some Nato members for not ceasing the purchase of Russian energy, saying they were \"funding a war against themselves\".\n\nTuesday's Truth Social post represents an about-face after Trump spent most of the year insisting that Ukraine's situation was dire.\n\nIn February, Trump told Zelensky during their fiery Oval Office exchange that he did \"not have the cards right now\" to prevail against a larger, more populous nation in a war of attrition.\n\nBefore talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August, Trump said he would try to get some territory back for Ukraine but warned there would be \"some swapping, changes in land\".\n\nThere were reports he was planning to press Zelensky to surrender the entirety of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in return for Russia freezing the rest of the front line - a proposal put forward by Putin in Alaska.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly threatened to impose tougher measures on Russia, but has so far failed to take any action when the Kremlin ignored his deadlines and threats of sanctions.\n\nUnpredictability has long been one of the US president's foreign policy trademarks, and perhaps this latest move is an attempt to shake up peace negotiations that have been stagnant for more than a month after Trump hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Alaska.\n\nThe most notable portion of Trump's post may be the way it ended - with an assurance the US would continue to sell arms to Nato that it could then pass along to Ukraine.\n\nIt is not the seemingly near open-ended commitment to the war effort that the Biden administration provided, but it is more than Trump seemed interested in offering at times this year."

The speech, marked by a broken teleprompter and off-script tangents, received a largely silent response from the audience.",
                "source": "cnn",
                "text": "It was perhaps an ominous sign when the first thing President Donald Trump said in his United Nations General Assembly speech Tuesday was that his teleprompter was broken.\n\n\u201cI feel very happy to be up here with you nevertheless,\u201d he said, sounding less than happy. \u201cThat way you speak more from the heart.\u201d\n\nWhat could have been a minor technical snafu \u2014 a UN official said it was up to the White House to operate the president\u2019s prompter; a White House official said it was the UN\u2019s apparatus \u2014 instead foretold a speech that both veered well off-script and questioned the UN\u2019s ability to solve problems much bigger than malfunctioning audio-visual equipment.\n\nTrump used the yearly foreign policy address to castigate foreign allies for supposedly ruining their countries with unchecked migration, fueling foreign conflicts with purchases of Russian energy, and ignoring his own peacemaking efforts.\n\nHe addressed the most pressing foreign conflicts \u2014 the wars in Ukraine and Gaza \u2014 only in passing, instead reserving most of his speech to bemoan efforts to combat climate change, tout his own approach to world issues and take swipes at his predecessor (he used former President Joe Biden\u2019s name six times in the speech).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell,\u201d he said at one point while talking about migration, a sentiment that neatly summed up the thesis of his speech.\n\nIn a sign of just how much the world has changed since he was laughed at from the same podium by delegates in his first term, the audience Tuesday sat mostly silent.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Trump\u2019s speech at the United Nations.\n\nA lecture on migration\n\nTrump spent much of his time in the General Assembly hall offering criticism of other nations\u2019 immigration policies, accusing the UN of \u201cfunding an assault on Western countries\u201d due to insufficient migration controls and warning the fabric of the West was being destroyed.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t stop people that you\u2019ve never seen before, that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail,\u201d he said at one point.\n\nIt essentially amounted to a lecture and a warning to Europe, which has seen waves of migrants from Africa and the Middle East in recent years, that his approach of sharply curbing migrants from entering the United States was the only way to preserve national heritage.\n\n\u201cOnce we started detaining and deporting everyone who crossed the border \u2014 and removing illegal aliens from the United States \u2014 they simply stopped coming,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said other leaders, particularly in Europe, would be wise to follow his lead.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing it because you want to be nice. You want to be politically correct, and you\u2019re destroying your heritage,\u201d he said.\n\nClimate change the \u2018greatest con job\u2019\n\nTrump scoffed at past predictions warning of global disaster from climate change and urged other nations to scrap green energy initiatives intended to reduce carbon output.\n\nClimate change, he said, was \u201cthe greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of climate scientists have concluded climate change is happening, and that it is mainly caused by fossil fuel pollution. Already, the world is seeing its effects: Floods are becoming more extreme and deadly, droughts are more widespread and severe, and heat waves are more dangerous.\n\nTrump was having none of it.\n\n\u201cAll of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThey were made by stupid people.\u201d\n\nThe president also claimed green energy policies allow countries without such restrictions \u2014 particularly in the developing world \u2014 to make money while the US lags behind.\n\n\u201cThe primary effect of these brutal green energy policies has not been to help the environment but to redistribute manufacturing and industrial activity from developed countries that follow the insane rules that are put down to polluting countries that break the rules and are making a fortune,\u201d Trump said.\n\nNo major shift on Ukraine or Gaza \u2013 until after the speech\n\nWhen he was speaking, Trump offered little new information when discussing the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, two conflicts he once said would be easy to resolve but continue to rage eight months into his term.\n\nHe lamented the growing momentum for a two-state solution at the United Nations this week as a \u201creward\u201d for Hamas, reaffirming calls for a ceasefire and end to the conflict in Gaza that have so far proved elusive.\n\nHe acknowledged ending the war in Ukraine had been more difficult than he expected, saying his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin hadn\u2019t translated into effective peace negotiations.\n\nBut instead of directing his ire toward Moscow, Trump berated European nations for continuing purchases of Russian energy products.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to them, and it was very embarrassing to them when I found out about it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey have to immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia. Otherwise, we\u2019re all wasting a lot of time.\u201d\n\nEuropean nations have dramatically reduced their oil purchases from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, but continue to purchase natural gas. Two countries, Hungary and Slovakia, make up the bulk of European purchases of Russian oil.\n\nTrump did identify China and India as the \u201cprimary funders of the ongoing war by continuing to purchase Russian oil,\u201d but accused European nations of also contributing. The US president also suggested he might speak to his \u201cfriend,\u201d Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, about stopping purchases of Russian oil.\n\nAfter the speech, though, Trump notably shifted his rhetoric on Russia \u2013 without a firm commitment to specific US action.\n\nFirst, in a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of UNGA, Trump said he believes NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft if they enter their airspace. The comment is notable as the defense alliance confronts the potential for an expansion of the war, although Trump stopped short of saying the United States would join in the effort.\n\nThen, Trump posted on Truth social that he believed Ukraine could continue to fight and \u201cWIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option. Why not?\u201d Trump wrote in a lengthy post, adding, \u201cUkraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that! Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.\u201d\n\nHis comments represent the first time since taking office that he\u2019s suggested the nation could win back all of the territory that Russia has taken since 2014. He had previously suggested Ukraine would need to give up some of its territory in order to secure a peace deal.\n\nBroken equipment \u2014 and a broken institution\n\nTrump used a broken escalator and his inoperable teleprompter to underscore his deeper complaints about the United Nations.\n\n\u201cThese are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,\u201d he said. (When he was arriving to the UN building on New York\u2019s East River earlier, the escalator stopped as he was riding up.)\n\nA United Nations spokesperson said that \u201ca built-in safety mechanism\u201d on the escalator was triggered, causing it to stop when Trump attempted to use it. In a lengthy note Tuesday evening, UN Secretary General spokesperson Stephane Dujarric explained that the mechanism may have been triggered by a videographer in the US delegation.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s gripes with the UN went well beyond its malfunctioning equipment.\n\n\u201cWhat is the purpose of the United Nations?\u201d he asked during his speech. And he added later: \u201cFor the most part, at least for now, all they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up. It\u2019s empty words, and empty words don\u2019t solve war.\u201d\n\nTrump is hardly the only one who has questioned the efficacy of the UN, which has seen its relevance wane dramatically over the last decade. A gridlocked Security Council and layers of rigid bureaucracy have made it difficult for the body to live up to its objective of promoting global peace and stability.\n\nTrump, however, has gone further in eroding its stature, slashing the money the US spends on the institution and cutting funding for foreign humanitarian aid and peacekeeping operations. He\u2019s also withdrawn from the UN\u2019s cultural, health and human rights arms.\n\nOn Tuesday, he also seemed irked that the UN had ignored his efforts to end global conflicts.\n\n\u201cI ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of each and every one of these countries, and never even received a phone call from the United Nations offering to help in finalizing the deal,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I got from the United Nations was an escalator, that on the way up, stopped right in the middle.\u201d\n\nVeering off-script\n\nTrump\u2019s speech began without a teleprompter, but as he meandered into various tangents, it seemed like he didn\u2019t really need one.\n\nHe went into digressions about his crime reduction efforts in US cities, Barack Obama\u2019s carbon footprint, his own stymied efforts to renovate the UN\u2019s headquarters, and the efficacy of windmills.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want cows anymore. I guess they want to kill all the cows,\u201d he said at one point, without explanation.\n\nIf there was a through line, it was his criticism of how most of the world \u2014 and the UN itself \u2014 is handling matters, and an accounting of how his approach is better. Even for Trump, however, the detours were striking.\n\n\u201cIn Asia, they dump much of their garbage right into the ocean,\u201d he intoned at another point.\n\nHis audience of global delegates didn\u2019t offer any audible reaction, beyond laughing at his description of meeting Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva backstage.\n\nHe went well beyond the 15-minute limit for leaders\u2019 speeches, though he would hardly be the only world leader to extend past his slotted time.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

                "text": "Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday that designates antifa as a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization\u201d, reviving a controversial pledge from his first presidency in the wake of Charlie Kirk\u2019s killing on 10 September and yesterday\u2019s memorial service.\n\n\u201cAntifa is a militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law,\u201d the order reads.\n\nThe president first made the announcement on his Truth Social platform last week, writing: \u201cI am pleased to inform our many U.S.A. Patriots that I am designating ANTIFA, A SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER, AS A MAJOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. I will also be strongly recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practices.\u201d\n\nThe move comes after the killing of far-right commentator Charlie Kirk in Utah. Trump blamed \u201cradical left wing political violence\u201d for the shooting, saying it is \u201cdirectly responsible for the terrorism that we\u2019re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now\u201d. No evidence has been presented linking the suspected Kirk assassin to antifa.\n\nSome extremist experts are however questioning the president\u2019s authority to make such a designation. Unlike foreign terrorist organizations like Islamic State, no legal framework exists for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations due to first amendment concerns about criminalizing political ideologies.\n\nBecause of that, Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism who has faced Congress as an expert witness on hate groups and extremism, said the move was \u201cridiculous on its face\u201d and that Trump\u2019s declaration appears to have \u201cno basis in law or fact\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no domestic terrorist organization list in the US,\u201d Beirich said. \u201cThere is a mechanism to declare foreign organizations terrorist organizations, and when that happens there are legal mechanisms to hamper them including such things as material support. But none of that exists domestically and it doesn\u2019t appear there would be a way to apply that designation to antifa\u201d.\n\nShe also added that antifa is not an organization with hierarchy or dues, which makes it unclear how it can be declared a terrorist organization in the first place \u201cunless new legislation is proposed or Trump comes up with some extra-legal mechanism that I can\u2019t even imagine\u201d.\n\nAntifa, short for \u201canti-fascist\u201d, operates as a decentralized network of face-covered street activists rather than a formal organization with leadership or membership rolls. Former FBI director Christopher Wray had consistently characterized it as \u201ca movement or an ideology\u201d, not an organization that could be formally designated.\n\nThis marks Trump\u2019s second attempt to brand antifa as a terrorist organization. During 2020 protests following George Floyd\u2019s murder, he posted: \u201cThe United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization.\u201d No formal designation followed.\n\nAnd while Trump may not be able to formally designate antifa as a terrorist organization, the administration could prioritize investigations of individuals claiming antifa affiliation, potentially leading to more frequent arrests using existing criminal statutes.\n\nWhen Trump first came into office, he pardoned Proud Boys and Oath Keepers convicted in the 6 January Capitol attack, marking a contrast in his treatment of far-right extremists versus leftwing extremists."

The incident has also reignited controversy over the state's antisemitism commissioner, Gerhard Ulrich, who has been accused of contributing to anti-Jewish sentiments.",

                "text": "A German shop owner in the northern city of Flensburg posted a sign on Wednesday that Jews are banned from entering his store, sparking outrage among state officials in Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nHans-Velten Reisch, the 60-year-old owner of the store that sells Gothic-Utensils and technical literature, posted a sign that reads, \u201cJews are banned from entering here! Nothing personal. No antisemitism. Just can\u2019t stand you.\u201d\n\nGermany\u2019s largest daily newspaper, Bild, reported on Thursday that Reisch defended his anti-Jewish sign.\n\nHe told the paper that \u201cI watch the news every evening. And when I saw what the Jews were doing in the Gaza Strip, I lost my temper and printed out the poster.\u201d\n\nIsrael launched a defensive war against the Hamas terrorist movement in Gaza after Hamas slaughtered over 1,200 people on October 7, 2023, including American citizens.\n\nReisch said the police told him on Wednesday evening that he has to take down the poster.\n\nThe Schleswig-Holstein Minister of Culture Dorit Stenke and Gerhard Ulrich, the state\u2019s controversial antisemitism commissioner, took Reisch to task for his reported antisemitism, issuing a joint statement on the state government\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cA sign that denies Jews access to a store is a frightening signal and an attack on the principles of our free coexistence,\u201d Stenke said in the statement. She continued, \u201cWe cannot allow such things to continue in our society and must take decisive action against it together. Antisemitism is a threat to our democracy and must not be tolerated in any form.\u201d\n\nUlrich said, \u201cWe must stand together against every form of antisemitism,\u201d adding, \u201cThe fight against antisemitism is a special responsibility that we bear as Germans.\u201d\n\nThe State Prosecutor launched an investigation against Reisch for incitement of hatred. Ulrich filed a criminal complaint for incitement of hatred against Reisch. A total of five criminal complaints were filed against Reisch, according to Bild.\n\n\u201cAntisemitic hate speech like this not only hurts those affected, but also disrupts public peace. The Flensburg incident, with its contemptuous rhetoric, is fatally reminiscent of the Nazi hate speech against Jews,\u201d said Ulrich.\n\nThe outbreak of Jew-hatred in Flensburg is another example of the growing antisemitism in Schleswig-Holstein, the state officials said.\n\nIn 2024, 588 antisemitic incidents were documented, an increase of 390 percent over 2023.\n\nUlrich, however, has faced accusations that he has contributed to anti-Jewish and anti-Israel sentiments when he previously served as the Protestant Church\u2019s Bishop for northern Germany.\n\nRabbi Abraham Cooper, the associate dean of the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization named after the legendary Nazi hunter, warned about Ulrich\u2019s alleged antisemitism in December 2022. Cooper urged Schleswig-Holstein\u2018s government to dismiss Ulrich, claiming he \u201cis unfit to denounce the very antisemitism that he unfortunately legitimized and helped to spread in the mainstream of German society.\u201d\n\nThe former bishop has said, \u201cThe name \u2018Israel\u2019 is burdened with the horror and misery of this Middle East war.\u201d He also compared Israel\u2019s security fence with the now-defunct Berlin Wall, suggesting Israel needs to dismantle its security fence.\n\nThe anti-terrorist fence has saved the lives of thousands of Israelis from Palestinian terrorists coming from the West Bank (also known as the biblical region of Judea and Samaria), according to counter-terrorism officials in Israel."

                "text": "1 day ago\n\nAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent\n\nThe event honouring conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a stadium in Arizona was a swirling mix of memorial service, big-church Christian religious revival and conservative political rally.\n\nIt also provided a glimpse of a Republican Party at a fork in the road, weighing a choice between forgiveness and retribution; reconciliation and conflict.\n\nThe leading lights of President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again coalition gathered for an hours-long celebration of Kirk's life, which included music and plenty of speeches.\n\nThe event provided a glimpse at the potential direction of travel for Trump's Maga movement, more than a decade after it emerged and upended US politics.\n\nErika Kirk a possible future star\n\nDespite the string of prominent politicians speaking on Sunday night, the defining moment came when Erika Kirk, Charlie's widow, took the stage. The 36-year-old former beauty contestant, podcaster and businesswoman took the opportunity to preach unity - including forgiveness for her husband's killer.\n\n\"The answer to hate is not hate,\" she said, her voice cracking. \"The answer, we know from the Gospel, is love and always love. Love for our enemies, and love for those who persecute us.\"\n\nIt was a powerful speech from a woman who has quickly found her footing in the harshest of spotlights. Last week, Turning Point USA named her the head of the conservative youth organization that her late husband founded, a group that is flush with new energy and determination in the aftermath of Kirk's murder.\n\nSunday night proved Erika Kirk has the strength and character to be an effective public face for the Turning Point USA.\n\nShe eventually could become a formidable candidate for public office in her home of Arizona, a key political battleground state. Her words also offered a contrast to the bombast and confrontation that has typified most of modern American politics.\n\nTrump's call to arms\n\nIf Erika Kirk offered a glimpse of a possible kinder, gentler future for the conservative movement, Donald Trump, who spoke immediately after her, provided a quick reminder that the Republican Party of today may have very different priorities.\n\n\"I hate my opponents, and I don't want what's best for them,\" Trump said with a chuckle. \"Now Erika can talk to me and the whole group and maybe they can convince me that's not right, but I can't stand my opponent.\"\n\nTrump's remarks come just a day after a Truth Social Post in which the president demanded that his Justice Department prosecute his political enemies \u2013 including California Senator Adam Schiff, former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nTrump hails Kirk as martyr at memorial service\n\nThe president also announced that he had fired a federal prosecutor who had recently announced that there was not enough evidence to charge James with a crime, replacing him with one of his former defence attorneys.\n\nTrump's remarks at the memorial service were jarring for the occasion, but he was not the only speaker to use the moment to promise action against \"enemies\".\n\n\"We are the storm,\" said senior White House adviser Stephen Miller. \"Our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion.\"\n\nHe went on to say that conservatives would fight for Western culture and traditions and that their opponents have nothing but wickedness and jealousy.\n\n\"You have no idea the dragon you have awakened,\" he said.\n\nHints of a religious revival\n\nWhile the event had its discordant notes, the overall theme was akin to a religious revival \u2013 reminiscent of Billy Graham's tent crusades of the 1930 and 1940s or the \"great awakenings\" of the 19th Century.\n\nThe memorial service celebrated Charlie Kirk's Christianity and promised a new enthusiasm among young Americans for traditional values with an evangelical fervour.\n\nTens of thousands of supporters packed the stadium and millions more watched online. Those numbers are sure to be encouraging for conservative leaders who want to see Christianity play a more central role in American public and political life \u2013 a view that Kirk himself repeatedly expressed.\n\n\"The body politic of America was so Christian and was so Protestant that our form and structure of government was built for the people that believed in Christ our Lord,\" Kirk said in 2024. \"You cannot have liberty if you do not have a Christian population.\"\n\nWhile Christianity has declined in the US in recent years, it is still the majority faith. Most surveys show that younger Americans are less religious than their elders, however, indicating that further shifts could be in store.\n\nKirk's death may prompt a religious awakening among American youth. If it doesn't, however, Sunday night's evangelical rhetoric could exclude as much as it unites \u2013 further exacerbating cultural and political divides in the nation.\n\nPresidential ambitions on display\n\nWe're only nine months into Trump's second term, but Sunday night also may have been an opening skirmish in the 2028 Republican presidential nomination contest.\n\nThree potential contenders \u2013 Vice-President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr \u2013 had prominent speaking slots.\n\nAll three talked of the importance of their relationship with Kirk and their personal religion \u2013 providing more focused, traditional eulogies that contrasted sharply with Trump's speech. But there was still a forward-looking political edge to them.\n\n\"For Charlie, we will rebuild this United States of America to greatness,\" Vance said. \"For Charlie, we will never shrink, we will never cower, and we will never falter, even when we are staring down the barrel of a gun.\"\n\nKennedy described of how Kirk \"changed the trajectory of history\" \u2013 and the risks of challenging \"entrenched interests\". Rubio praised Kirk for inspiring Americans to \"live a productive life, get married, start a family, love your country.\"\n\nTrump, of course, was a prominent speaker at the rally, but the president of the United States was not the dominant force the way he often is at political events.\n\nConservatives on Sunday began to get a taste of those who might become key players on the national stage once Trump leaves the scene.\n\nAn unexpected Musk reconciliation"

While condemning the assassination, they have long objected vociferously to Kirk\u2019s brand of politics and his comments about Black and transgender people, among many other subjects.\n\nBut they had to vote either to affirm those laurels or against condemning Kirk\u2019s assassination in the terms that were set forward.\n\nAbout half of Democrats decided they couldn\u2019t support that.\n\nNotably, the level of praise for Kirk in the resolution is a marked contrast to other recent resolutions condemning political violence.\n\nPerhaps the best comparison is to a Senate resolution passed earlier last week that didn\u2019t include such extensive praise of Kirk. It merely described him as a \u201cdevoted husband, father, and Christian\u201d and said he \u201cfrequently engaged college students of all political backgrounds in open debates and discussion, encouraging civil discourse on college campuses.\u201d\n\nThis measure passed by unanimous consent \u2014 meaning that unlike in the House, no Democrats objected.\n\nDespite Mullin\u2019s claim that the Hortman resolution was \u201cthe same\u201d as the House Kirk resolution except for the name attached, it did not praise her nearly as much. It at one point called Hortman a \u201cformidable public servant\u201d with \u201cdeep devotion, compassion, and strength.\u201d It also cited her \u201ctireless efforts to serve the people of Minnesota.\u201d But that was the extent.\n\nThe House Kirk resolution is an even bigger contrast to a resolution the Senate passed by unanimous consent in 2015 after a White supremacist massacre at a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina. The massacre claimed the life of a Democratic state senator, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, and eight others.\n\nThe 2015 resolution did not include specific praise of Pinckney or the other victims.\n\nDitto a 1972 resolution on the attempted assassination of George Wallace that was signed into law.\n\nThe Senate also took care not to politicize such resolutions after the assassination attempt against President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania last year.\n\nThe initial resolution on the attack was a very straightforward condemnation and was actually co-sponsored by 90 of 100 senators, including the vast majority of Democrats.\n\nAnother resolution on the one-year anniversary this summer made a point to also highlight attacks on Democratic politicians that occurred in the intervening period \u2014 not just the Hortman assassination, but also the arson attack at Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s residence.\n\nBoth passed by unanimous consent.\n\nDemocrats have assailed House Republicans for what they have cast as needlessly politicizing the Kirk resolution.\n\n\u201cMy deep regret that Mr. Kirk was killed and my respect for his First Amendment right to express himself freely does not make him someone that should be elevated as a role model for the American public,\u201d Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi said.\n\nThompson added: \u201cThis resolution is intentionally written to be divisive, and I must oppose it.\u201d\n\nWhether the resolution is ultimately something Democrats should have voted for anyway is for people to make their own decisions about. But it\u2019s clear House Republicans were putting Democrats in a tough spot by making it unlike other recent resolutions in similar circumstances. (The fact that there was no real dissension over the Senate\u2019s version demonstrates that.)\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for majorities to pull such a move with symbolic resolutions; it\u2019s part of the benefit of being in control and being able to massage the language of the things you\u2019re voting on.\n\nBut usually that\u2019s not the case with such high-profile tragedies, when there\u2019s been a premium on bringing people together for a show of unity.\n\nThat an assassination would now devolve into such politicking is truly a sign of our political time."

Nearly 100,000 attendees in Arizona celebrated Kirk as a martyr for the conservative movement, with Trump and other leaders using the occasion to galvanize support and cast Kirk's death as a pivotal moment.

                "text": "Democrats maintained a wary silence on Monday as Donald Trump\u2019s Republican party appeared galvanised by a memorial service for the late rightwing activist Charlie Kirk that was part religious revival, part political rally.\n\nNearly 100,000 people filled an American football stadium and overflow arena in Glendale, Arizona, on Sunday to pay tribute to Kirk, according to his his organisation Turning Point USA. The 31-year-old staunch Trump ally was shot dead on 10 September.\n\nThe service was a show of force that blended politics with religion, putting Christian nationalism at the heart of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America great again\u201d (Maga) movement. It also cast Kirk as a martyr who could be a rallying point in future elections. \u201cToday is the day democrats lost 2028,\u201d posted Meghan McCain, the daughter of the late Republican senator John McCain.\n\nKirk\u2019s widow, Erika, earned widespread praise for a tearful address in which she said she forgives the man charged with her husband\u2019s killing. She told the crowd: \u201cMy husband, Charlie, he wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life. I forgive him.\u201d\n\nErika Kirk is taking over as leader of Turning Point USA, which was crucial in mobilising young voters for Trump in last year\u2019s election. The organisation has received a wave of support from big donors and Trump allies since Kirk\u2019s death, along with young conservatives pledging to start new branches.\n\nThe memorial featured leading Christian rock artists, giving it the air at times of a megachurch Sunday service. As music filled the arena, some mourners dressed in red, white and blue closed their eyes and swayed with their arms in the air, tears rolling down their cheeks.\n\nBut there was a mark shift in tone with Trump and other political figures took the stage. They cast Kirk\u2018s death as a pivotal moment in the conservative movement, exhorting followers to finish the work he began in sometimes aggressive and ominous language.\n\nStephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said in a fiery speech: \u201cWe will carry Charlie and Erika in our heart every single day, and fight that much harder because of what you did to us. You have no idea the dragon you have awakened. You have no idea how determined we will be to save this civilisation, to save the west, to save the republic.\u201d\n\nClosing out the five-hour service, Trump insisted \u201cthe violence comes largely from the left\u201d, without citing any evidence and leaning into campaign-style grievances. He quipped that Kirk \u201cdidn\u2019t hate his opponents. He wanted the best for them. That\u2019s where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponents and I don\u2019t want the best for them. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nMehdi Hasan, a leading political broadcaster and commentator, posted in response: \u201cDonald Trump is the most openly and proudly divisive president in modern American history.\u201d\n\nThe speech was unlikely to quell fears that he intends to use Kirk\u2019s murder to intensify a crackdown on political opponents. Last week Walt Disney\u2019s ABC network pulled late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air after Trump\u2019s head of the Federal Communications Commission threatened the network over comments Kimmel made about Kirk\u2019s death.\n\nDemocrats trod carefully in responding to the memorial service, aware that any hint of criticism might be misconstrued and exploited. But Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman who now co-hosts a prominent politics show on the liberal MSNBC network, told viewers: \u201cThere were two beats and it did sound, when the politicians got up there, very discordant.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of a celebration of a life and talking about Jesus\u2019s words and Jesus\u2019s commandments of us to forgive others, at times there was another tone that was taken. So I found that to be discordant.\u201d\n\nOn the same edition of Morning Joe, presidential historian Jon Meacham touched on the political dilemma for Democrats, a party that has been accused of being out of touch with America\u2019s Christian heartland. Meacham urged viewers not to feel \u201creflexively uncomfortable\u201d about the religious outpouring.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere was a feeling, particularly with Mrs Kirk, that it was something that had what appeared to be a genuinely religious component. And then came the president who spoke the way President Trump speaks. And that should be considered on its merits.\u201d\n\nKirk, 31, was a provocateur who at times made statements that were racist, misogynistic, anti-immigrant and transphobic. He was killed with a single bullet as he answered an audience member\u2019s question at a campus event in Utah.\n\nA 22-year-old technical college student has been charged with Kirk\u2018s murder, and investigators say he told his romantic partner in text messages that he killed Kirk because he had \u201cenough of his hate\u201d.\n\nTyler Bowyer, a Turning Point executive, recalled of Kirk on Sunday: \u201cHe always said to me: \u2018If we could just figure out how to bring the Holy Spirit into a Trump rally.\u2019 Think you\u2019ve done it.\u201d"

                "text": "Since his assassination on September 10, misinformation about Charlie Kirk has spread like wildfire.\n\nHis words have been misquoted in posts spread online, progressives have weaponized selective snippets of his debates and his ideas have been reduced to sweeping and inaccurate generalizations. Here are the most common misperceptions:\n\nHomosexuality\n\nAuthor Stephen King claimed Kirk had advocated \u201cstoning gays\u201d in a social media post. He later took his post down and apologized after admitting he had got it completely wrong.\n\nIn fact, Kirk was simply quoting the Bible in reaction to YouTube personality Ms. Rachel cherry-picking Biblical phrases to celebrate Pride Month.\n\n\u201cBy the way, Ms. Rachel, you might want to crack open that Bible of yours. In a lesser reference, part of the same part of scripture, in Leviticus 18, is that \u2018thou shall lay with another man shall be stoned to death.\u2019 Just saying.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Kirk once admonished a student who said there was no room for gay men in the conservative movement by listing a number of gay Conservatives.\n\n\u201cWhat does what they do in their private life concern you so much?\u201d he asked.\n\nKirk was, instead, critical of what he called the \u201cLGBTQ agenda\u201d in politics, telling a gay Wisconsin college student last year: \u201cI don\u2019t think you should introduce yourself just based on your sexuality because that\u2019s not who you are.\u201d\n\nBlack women\n\nKirk has been misquoted as saying \u201cBlack women do not have the brain processing power to be taken seriously\u201d \u2014 an inflammatory but wildly incorrect statement which led the Financial Times to publish a retraction after printing it.\n\nKirk\u2019s actual words weren\u2019t aimed at black women as a whole. As part of a discussion about who benefits from DEI, he called out four specific women: Michelle Obama, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, political commentator Joy Reid and the late Texas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.\n\nOn his show on July 14, 2023, Kirk said: \u201cIf we would have said [those women] were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now \u2026 They\u2019re coming out and saying \u2018I\u2019m only here because of affirmative action.\u2019 We know. You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously.\u201d\n\nGun violence\n\nKirk was speaking about gun violence when he was killed at Utah Valley University in Orem. After the 31-year-old Turning Point USA founder\u2019s death, former Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah called him \u201ca white man that espoused violence,\u201d leading to her being fired.\n\nKirk never advocated violence and saw healthy debate as the best way to tackle it. He also strongly believed in the second amendment and the protections it affords citizens.\n\nAt a 2023 event he explained: \u201cDriving comes with a price \u2014 50,000 people die on the road every year. But we have decided that the benefit of driving \u2014 speed, accessibility, mobility, having products, services is worth the cost of 50,000 people dying on the road.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to be very clear that you\u2019re not going to get gun deaths to zero. It will not happen \u2026 You will never live in a society when you have an armed citizenry and you won\u2019t have a single gun death. But I am \u2014 I think it\u2019s worth it. I think it\u2019s worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.\n\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh, Charlie, how do you stop school shootings?\u2019 I don\u2019t know. How did we stop shootings at baseball games? Because we have armed guards outside of baseball games. That\u2019s why. How did we stop all the shootings at airports? We have armed guards outside of airports.\u201d\n\nCivil Rights Act\n\nDemocratic New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blasted Kirk in a recent media release.\n\n\u201cWe should be clear about who Charlie Kirk was, a man who believed that the Civil Rights Act that granted black Americans the right to vote was a mistake,\u201d she said, confusing the 1964 Civil Rights Act with the Voting Rights Act, which was passed a year later.\n\nThis topic is where Kirk has most been misunderstood, as he never criticized civil rights, but the way they have been interpreted in recent times.\n\n\u201cI have a very, very radical view on this, but I can defend it, and I\u2019ve thought about it,\u201d Kirk said at a Turning Point USA event in December 2023. \u201cWe made a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s.\n\n\u201cThe courts have been really weak on this,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cFederal courts just yield to the Civil Rights Act as if it\u2019s the actual American Constitution.\u201d He added that the Act led to a \u201cpermanent DEI-type bureaucracy,\u201d referring to diversity, equity and inclusion dictates that dominated hiring at many institutions in recent years.\n\nIn subsequent comments, he praised the act, saying: \u201cParts of the Civil Rights Act were great,\u201d said Kirk after being confronted on his stance by a student. \u201cThe intent was noble, which was to say that no American can be not allowed into a place of business based on the color of their skin, or their ethnic heritage.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s rights\n\nIt has frequently been repeated online that Kirk had claimed women should not vote \u2014 but that is a complete fabrication.\n\nKirk had frequently talking about how he believed women should be at the center of family life and that they should prioritize raising a family over their career.\n\nIn an appearance on Fox\u2019s \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d just days before he died, he said: \u201cHaving children is more important than having a good career. And I would also tell young ladies, you can always go back to your career later, that there is a window where you should primarily should pursue marriage and having children and that is a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\nBlack pilots\n\nKirk has also been quoted as saying \u201cIf I see a Black pilot, I\u2019m going to be like \u2018I hope he\u2019s qualified.\u201d While often repeated on social media, it lacks important context.\n\nKirk made the remark on the \u201cCharlie Kirk Show\u201d in a conversation with three others about DEI initiatives for airline pilots.\n\nOne of his guests, Andrew Kolvet, noted that \u201cwe\u2019ve all been in the back of a plane when the turbulence hits and you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m so glad I saw the guy with the right stuff and the square jaw get into the cockpit before we took off.\u201d\n\nKirk replied with the line about black pilots, noting that it was his reaction to DEI.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not an immediate \u2026 that\u2019s not who I am,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I believe\u2026 I want to be as blunt as possible because now I\u2019m connecting two dots. Wait a second, this CEO just said that he\u2019s forcing [out] a white qualified guy \u2026 So I see this guy, he might be a nice person and I say, \u2018Boy, I hope he\u2019s not a Harvard-style affirmative-action student that \u2026 [only] landed half of his flight-simulator trials.\u2019\u201d"

During his speech at the UNGA, US President Donald Trump promised that Iran would \u201cnever possess a nuclear weapon\u201d, describing Tehran as the \u201cworld\u2019s number one sponsor of terror\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe US has announced the result of the talks in advance,\u201d Khamenei said in his recorded address. \u201cThe result is the closure of nuclear activities and enrichment. This is not a negotiation. It is a diktat, an imposition.\u201d\n\nIt comes days after the UN Security Council (UNSC) rejected a resolution to extend sanctions relief for Iran.\n\nThe E3 have accused Tehran of breaching its nuclear commitments, including by building up a uranium stockpile of more than 40 times the level permitted under a 2015 nuclear deal, from which Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018, during his first term.\n\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed between Iran and the world powers, including the US, that lifted sanctions in exchange for a cap on Iranian nuclear ambitions.\n\nBut as part of his so-called \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy, Trump had reimposed sanctions on Iran in 2018. The subsequent administration of President Joe Biden continued with Trump\u2019s policies on Iran, despite initially denouncing them.\n\nEuropean nations have said they would be willing to extend the deadline on sanctions if Iran resumes direct negotiations with the US over its nuclear programme, allows UN nuclear inspectors access to its nuclear sites and accounts for the more than 400kg (880 pounds) of its highly enriched uranium that the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog says it has.\n\nTuesday\u2019s meeting on the sidelines of the UNGA does not appear to have made much progress, with Al Jazeera\u2019s James Bays reporting that German Minister for Foreign Affairs Johann Wadephul said it \u201cdidn\u2019t go particularly well\u201d.\n\nThe European negotiating team needs to see \u201csome real action\u201d from Iran to avert sanctions, EU foreign policy chief Kallas said.\n\n\u201cDiplomacy has a chance. The deadlines are running, and let\u2019s see. We need to see some real action also on the Iranian side,\u201d she said.\n\nIran\u2019s nuclear doctrine\n\nIran has repeatedly denied pursuing nuclear weapons, but affirmed its right to peacefully pursue nuclear energy.\n\nKhamenei\u2019s speech on Tuesday reaffirmed Tehran\u2019s nuclear doctrine: Iran does not want nuclear weapons, but it will not yield to international pressure, Al Jazeera\u2019s Tohid Assadi, reporting from Tehran, said.\n\nTensions escalated this in June, when Israel launched a 12-day war on Iran, with Israeli and US forces striking several nuclear facilities. The Israeli-US bombing came a day after the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog board ruled that Iran was not respecting international nuclear safeguards.\n\nThe UNSC voted last week not to permanently lift economic sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme, delivering a major economic blow that Tehran claimed was \u201cpolitically biased\u201d.\n\nThat vote followed a 30-day process launched in late August by the E3 to reinstate sanctions unless Tehran met their demands.\n\nIran pushed back against the UNSC vote, saying the resumption of sanctions would \u201ceffectively suspend\u201d the country\u2019s cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN watchdog.\n\nOn Monday, hardline lawmakers in Iran demanded that the country start building a nuclear bomb over concerns the resumption of sanctions could restart war with Israel.\n\nIf no diplomatic deal is found this week, the sanctions will automatically \u201csnap back\u201d on Saturday evening. That would again freeze Iranian assets abroad, halt arms deals with Tehran and penalise any development of Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme, among other measures.\n\nAll hope may not be lost, however. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday that a team of inspectors was on its way to Iran, just in case the countries reach a deal and avoid the resumption of sanctions.\n\n\u201cEverything is possible. Where there is a will, there is a way,\u201d Grossi said. \u201cWe have our inspectors, and inspectors are on the way, and there is the possibility to start on this work, depending on the political will of Iran.\u201d"

This pact has raised concerns in India, particularly due to its commitment that aggression against one country will be viewed as aggression against both, which some analysts interpret as a direct threat to India's security. While some experts believe the deal formalizes a long-standing relationship rather than posing an immediate risk, it signals a shift in regional alignments and Saudi Arabia's evolving security partnerships.",
                "source": "BBC",
                "text": "When Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan's prime minister, clasped Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh last week, the symbolism was unmistakable.\n\nThe embrace followed the signing of a \"strategic mutual defence agreement\", bringing the Islamic world's only nuclear-armed state closer to the Gulf's most ambitious monarchy.\n\nA senior Saudi official told Reuters that the pact was merely an \"institutionalisation of long-standing and deep cooperation\". But many in India see it differently.\n\nDespite Delhi's cultivated warmth with Riyadh, the pact lands amid heightened hostility with Pakistan, including a four-day conflict earlier this year. Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan have fought multiple wars and clashes over Kashmir, making any move by Saudi to underwrite Pakistan's military a direct concern.\n\nWhat unsettles Indian analysts the most is the pact's commitment that \"any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both\".\n\n\"Riyadh knew India would construe the Saudi-Pakistan pact as a direct threat to its security, yet it went ahead,\" Brahma Chellaney, an Indian strategist, posted on X.\n\n\"The move reflects not Pakistan's strength - it remains on the brink of bankruptcy - but Saudi Arabia's ambitions\", he says. Binding a \"chronically dependent\" partner, he argues, gives Riyadh both manpower and nuclear \"insurance\", while demonstrating to India, Washington and others that it will chart its own path.\n\nFormer Indian foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal called the pact a \"grave misstep\" by Saudi Arabia, warning that this could have serious implications for India's national security.\n\n\"A politically unstable and economically broken Pakistan as a security provider is a dangerous proposition. Saudi Arabia knows this will be construed in India as a threat to India's security,\" Mr Sibal posted on X. \"Given the tensions between Pakistan and India, this Saudi step is strategically most adventurous.\"\n\nIndia's Narendra Modi-led government has been more circumspect, with a foreign ministry spokesman noting that the government will \"study its [the pact's] implications for national security and regional and global stability\". India also hoped that the strategic partnership between India and Saudi Arabia would \"keep in mind mutual interests and sensitivities\".\n\nNot all analysts are alarmed, saying Delhi may be overstating the risks since Riyadh values balanced ties - India is its second-largest trading partner and a major buyer of Saudi oil.\n\nMichael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, cautions against over-reading the agreement. It \"does not hinder India in a direct way\", he told the BBC. Saudi Arabia, with its own extensive ties to India, is \"not about to engage in hostile retaliatory acts against India\", he said.\n\nStill, by embedding Pakistan in the security architecture of the Middle East, the deal \"checkmates India\" and leaves its neighbour anchored to three patrons - China, Turkey and now Saudi Arabia, Mr Kugelman said. China and Turkey supplied weapons to Pakistan in its recent conflict with India.\n\nOthers argue that the real significance of the pact lies less in any immediate threat to India and more in how it reshapes regional alignments.\n\nHusain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador who is currently a scholar at Washington DC's Hudson Institute and the Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy in Abu Dhabi, told the BBC that India's concerns span \"multiple fronts\".\n\nHe warned that the pact could make Saudi Arabia what the US was to Pakistan during the Cold War - \"a country with the economic muscle to help Pakistan build its military to compete with India\".\n\nMuch depends, Mr Haqqani notes, on how the pact defines \"aggression\" and \"aggressor\" and whether Riyadh and Islamabad see eye to eye. He also cautioned it could strain India's hard-won economic and diplomatic ties with Riyadh.\n\nBut not everyone sees the pact as a game-changer.\n\n\"This pact is simply the formalisation of a long-standing Saudi-Pakistan understanding that goes back to the 1960s,\" says Md. Muddassir Quamar of the Centre for West Asian Studies at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.\n\nIndeed, the two countries share a resilient relationship rooted in defence ties - from Pakistani troop deployments in the 1960s to commandos helping quell the 1979 Mecca mosque siege.\n\nRiyadh has since bought Pakistani weapons, relied on its officers to build up the Saudi Air Force, and cultivated Pakistan as both an ideological ally and security partner. In 2017 Riyadh had also tapped a retired Pakistani army chief to lead its Saudi-sponsored anti-ISIS coalition.\n\nMr Haqqani notes that Saudi political, economic and military support has underpinned this reliance for decades.\n\n\"Since the 1970s, Saudi Arabia has consistently backed Islamabad, siding with it during the 1965 and 1971 wars with India, extending economic aid in times of crisis, allowing deferred oil payments, and maintaining a close military partnership,\" he says.\n\nBeyond the longstanding alliance, experts point to a bigger trigger: declining faith in the US security umbrella and growing doubt that it can - or will - defend the Gulf in a crisis.\n\nIsrael's recent attack, which rattled Qatar and other Gulf states, reinforced Riyadh's doubts - compounded by its long-running rivalry with Iran - about relying solely on Washington.\n\nThe deal is less about battlefield commitments than signalling intent, says Ahmed Aboudouh, associate fellow at Chatham House and senior researcher at Emirate Policy Center.\n\n\"It is designed to convey a message that Saudi Arabia is diversifying its security partnership without jeopardising its defence cooperation with the US,\" Mr Aboudouh told the BBC.\n\n\"Although the operational depth of the deal is unclear, it indicates a shift in Saudi Arabia's threat perception, seeing both Iran and Israel as a threat, and benefitting from Pakistan's nuclear power status to enhance deterrence.\""

While working at SpaceX, Menon was selected by tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to join him on Polaris Dawn, an experimental mission that traveled higher in its orbit around Earth than any crewed spacecraft had flown in decades. The mission, conducted last year aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, also included the first spacewalk carried out by the private sector.\n\nMenon will join her husband, Anil Menon, in the astronaut corps. Anil is also a former SpaceX employee, and he was chosen for the NASA astronaut corps during the last round of selections in 2021.\n\nJones, the Air Force major from Illinois, said Menon is already being peppered with questions from her classmates.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so gracious,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be leaning on her expertise; she just has an amazing story of what she\u2019s been able to accomplish and is just so proficient and incredible.\u201d\n\nJones added that, for him, becoming an astronaut has been a lifelong pursuit \u2014 in part because Space Shuttle-era NASA astronaut Dale Gardner hailed from the same tiny town.\n\n\u201cEvery time I walked by the trophy case in high school, there was his picture with a flag that he flew while he was in space,\u201d Jones told CNN. \u201cThat kind of gave me the thought: Even someone from a small town could go out and do something like this.\u201d\n\nEach class of incoming astronauts receives a special nickname selected by the prior class. The 2021 group \u2014 dubbed the \u201cFlies\u201d in part as a nod to how rapidly the class was likely to be assigned to and flown on missions to orbit \u2014 will bestow this group\u2019s nickname.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of all the Flies, we look forward to getting to know your class so we can give you a name befitting your personalities and appropriate for the exciting and dynamic time,\u201d said NASA astronaut Chris Birch.\n\nThe path ahead\n\nThe 10 new astronauts will spend the next two years in intensive training, during which they will \u201clearn NASA\u2019s history and our vision for the future, they will take classes in geology and in water survival and space health,\u201d said Stephen Koerner, the deputy director of NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center.\n\n\u201cThey even get to train in our high-performance jets,\u201d Koerner added.\n\nOnce training is completed, the new class will join the 48 other members of the space agency\u2019s astronaut corps and become eligible for flight assignments. And that could be a different experience than those picked during the last selection round in 2021.\n\nAt that time, NASA still had a decade of International Space Station operations ahead. But now, the space agency is preparing to wind down activity at the orbiting laboratory by the early 2030s and commission new space stations operated by the private sector.\n\nFor two decades, the ISS has been the only in-space destination for NASA astronauts to visit.\n\nWhile Norman Knight, director of NASA flight operations, said during Monday\u2019s news conference that \u201cmany of these candidates sitting here today will have the opportunity to visit\u201d the ISS, he emphasized that space station is supposed to serve as a learning laboratory for more difficult missions deeper into space.\n\n\u201cEvery lesson learned aboard station has paved the way of where we\u2019re headed: next to the moon \u2014 this time to stay \u2014 and on to Mars,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what other flight assignments these astronauts may be eligible for. NASA is likely to tap more experienced astronauts for moon missions. The agency has already selected a group of veteran fliers for Artemis II, a test mission that will fly around the moon as soon as next year.\n\nBut NASA officials did indicate that they hope the young group of astronauts selected on Monday may be eligible for flights later in the Artemis program to the moon and perhaps even to Mars \u2014 where no human has yet traveled."

                "text": "The overwhelming majority of tech industry workers use artificial intelligence on the job for tasks like writing and modifying code, a new Google study has found.\n\nThe report, coming from Google\u2019s DORA research division and based on 5,000 responses from technology professionals around the world, found that 90% of respondents are using AI in their job, up 14% from last year.\n\nThe findings come as the rise of AI has prompted a mix of concern, hype and promise around how the technology could impact jobs and the economy. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made headlines in May when he said AI could lead to a spike in unemployment, a sentiment that other tech industry professionals have since tamped down. But some data does suggest it\u2019s getting harder for entry-level workers to find jobs in software engineering, a trend that comes amid a wave of layoffs in the tech industry.\n\nGoogle is one of many companies looking to capitalize on the shift to AI-assisted software development; it offers tools that range from free to $45 per month for helping with code generation and deploying agents that can handle software development tasks. And the company faces widespread competition, not just from rivals like Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic but also AI coding startups such as Replit and Anysphere, which are seeing their valuations soar as tech companies increasingly adopt AI.\n\nRyan J. Salva, who oversees Google\u2019s coding tools like Gemini Code Assist, said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of teams at Google are using AI, saying the technology has been embedded into everything from the way documentation is written to Google\u2019s code editors.\n\n\u201cIf you are an engineer at Google, it is unavoidable that you will be using AI as part of your daily work,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN ahead of the report\u2019s release.\n\nBut just because coders use AI doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re all finding value in it. Forty-six percent of tech professionals who participated in the survey said they \u201csomewhat\u201d trust the quality of AI-generated code, while 23% said they only trust it \u201ca little\u201d and 20% said they trust it \u201ca lot.\u201d And 31% said AI \u201cslightly improved\u201d code quality, while 30% said it had \u201cno impact.\u201d\n\nSalva says on a scale of one to five, with one being basic text prediction and five being the ability to give AI a general vague command, AI software development is somewhere between stage three and four. That\u2019s to say AI can troubleshoot across systems but still needs human review and \u201clots of safety nets.\u201d\n\nThe adoption of AI tools comes at a challenging time for entry-level tech workers. The unemployment rate for recent computer science and computer engineering graduates is now higher than that for fields like art history and English, according to The New York Fed, and job listings for software engineering roles on Indeed fell by 71% between February 2022 and August 2025.\n\nRecent computer science graduates who spoke with CNN earlier this year were generally optimistic about future career prospects but acknowledged that AI is changing the nature of the job. One recent graduate, Julio Rodriguez, said he applied to more than 150 jobs before landing a role.\n\nWhile AI adoption is advancing fast, Salva is in the camp of those who believe that there are critical parts of software development hat cannot be automated and that AI will streamline the parts that workers find mundane.\n\nBut he acknowledges that at least some of the uptick in adopting AI has probably come from the buzz surrounding the technology.\n\n\u201cSoftware development is a fashion industry\u2026 We\u2019re all chasing the next style of jeans,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when there\u2019s that much conversation about it, everyone\u2019s just excited to try the new thing.\u201d"

But I\u2019ve been doing this now for about 14-15 years, and there hasn\u2019t been much of a difference in how long it takes me to complete projects over the last five or six years.\u201d\n\n\u201cAuto transcription is the only place where I have seen some positive advancements,\u201d Cannella adds, \u201cbut even then that doesn\u2019t affect the total amount of time that it takes to produce an SDH file.\u201d So many corrections are needed that there\u2019s no net benefit compared to using older software.\n\nMoreover the quality of AI-generated SDH is so poor that much work is needed to bring them up to standard \u2013 but because human subtitlers are often assigned tasks as \u201cquality control\u201d, payment is minimal. Subtle notes that many of its members are now unable to make a living wage.\n\n\u201cSDH rates are not great to start with, but now they\u2019re so low that it\u2019s not even worth taking the work,\u201d says Rachel Jones, audiovisual translator and member of the Subtle committee. \u201cIt really undermines the role that we play.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s a vital role. Teri Devine, associate director of inclusion at the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, says: \u201cFor people who are deaf or have hearing loss, subtitles are an essential service \u2013 allowing them to enjoy film and TV with loved ones and stay connected to popular culture.\u201d\n\nThe deaf and hard-of-hearing community is not monolithic, which means subtitlers are juggling a variety of needs in SDH creation. Jones says: \u201cSome people might say that having the name of a song subtitled is completely useless, because it tells them nothing. But others might have a memory of how the song went, and they\u2019ll be able to connect to it through the song\u2019s title. Some people think that emotional cues get in the way and tell them how to feel rather than being objective. Others want them.\u201d\n\nSubtitling involves much creative and emotionally driven decision-making, two things that AI does not currently have the capacity for. When Jones first watches a show, she writes down how the sounds make her feel, then works out how to transfer her reactions into words. Next, she determines which sounds need to be subtitled and which are excessive. \u201cYou can\u2019t overwhelm the viewer,\u201d she says. It is a delicate balance. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to describe something that would be clear to the audience,\u201d Cannella says, \u201cand sometimes, what\u2019s going on on the screen is much more important than the audio. The gentle music might not matter!\u201d\n\nAI is unable to decide which sounds are important. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s not even close,\u201d Deryagin says. He also stresses the importance of the broader context of a film, rather than looking at isolated images or scenes. In Blow Out (1981), for example, a mysterious sound is heard. Later, that sound is heard again \u2013 and, for hearing viewers, reveals a major plot point. \u201cSDH must instantly connect those two things, but also not say too much in the first instance, because viewers have to wonder what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says. \u201cThe same sound can mean a million different things. As humans, we interpret what it means and how it\u2019s supposed to feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just give an algorithm a soundtrack and say, \u2018here are the sounds, figure it out\u2019. Even if you give it metadata, it can\u2019t get anywhere near the level of professional work. I\u2019ve done my experiments!\u201d\n\nNetflix shared a glimpse of its SDH processes after subtitles from Stranger Things, such as \u201c[Eleven pants]\u201d or \u201c[Tentacles squelching wetly]\u201d went viral, via an interview with its subtitlers. The company declined to comment further on its use of AI in its subtitling. The BBC told the Guardian: \u201cThere is no use of AI for subtitles on TV,\u201d though much of its work is outsourced to Red Bee Media, which last year published a statement on its use of AI in SDH creation for Australian broadcaster Network 10.\n\nJones says that linguists and subtitlers are not necessarily against AI \u2013 but at the moment, it\u2019s making practitioners\u2019 lives harder rather than easier. \u201cIn every industry, AI is being used to replace all the creative things that bring us joy instead of the boring, tedious tasks we hate doing,\u201d she says."

                "text": "Panic, confusion and then a hasty White House climbdown - it was a weekend of whiplash for hundreds of thousands of Indians on H-1B visas.\n\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump stunned the tech world by announcing an up to 50-fold hike in the cost of skilled worker permits - to $100,000. Chaos followed: Silicon Valley firms urged staff not to travel outside the country, overseas workers scrambled for flights, and immigration lawyers worked overtime to decode the order.\n\nBy Saturday, the White House sought to calm the storm, clarifying that the fee applied only to new applicants and was a one-off. Yet, the long-standing H-1B programme - criticised for undercutting American workers but praised for attracting global talent - still faces an uncertain future.\n\nEven with the tweak, the policy effectively shutters the H-1B pipeline that, for three decades, powered the American dream for millions of Indians and, more importantly, supplied the lifeblood of talent to US industries.\n\nThat pipeline reshaped both countries. For India, the H-1B became a vehicle of aspiration: small-town coders turned dollar earners, families vaulted into the middle class, and entire industries - from airlines to real estate - catered to a new class of globe-trotting Indians.\n\nFor the US, it meant an infusion of talent that filled labs, classrooms, hospitals and start-ups. Today, Indian-origin executives run Google, Microsoft and IBM, and Indian doctors make up nearly 6% of the US physician workforce.\n\nIndians dominate the H-1B programme, making up more than 70% of the recipients in recent years. (China was the second-largest source, making up about 12% of beneficiaries.)\n\nIn tech, their presence is even starker: a Freedom of Information Act request in 2015 showed over 80% of \"computer\" jobs went to Indian nationals - a share industry insiders say hasn't shifted much.\n\nThe medical sector underlines the stakes. In 2023, more than 8,200 H-1Bs were approved to work in general medicine and surgical hospitals.\n\nIndia is the largest single source of international medical graduates (who are typically in US on H-1B visas) and make up about 22% of all international doctors. With international doctors forming up to a quarter of US physicians, Indian H-1B holders likely account for around 5-6% of the total.\n\nExperts say pay data shows why Trump's new $100,000 fee is unworkable. In 2023, the median salary for new H-1B employees was $94,000, compared with $129,000 for those already in the system. Since the fee targets new hires, most won't even earn enough to cover it, say experts.\n\n\"Since the latest White House directive indicates that the fee would only apply to new H-1B recipients, this is more likely to cause medium and long-term labour shortages instead of immediate disruption,\" Gil Guerra, an immigration policy analyst at the Niskanen Center, told the BBC.\n\nIndia may feel the shock first, but the ripple effects could run deeper in the US. Indian outsourcing giants such as TCS and Infosys have long prepared for this by building local workforces and shifting delivery offshore.\n\nThe numbers tell the story: Indians still account for 70% of H-1B recipients, but only three of the top 10 H-1B employers had ties to India in 2023, down from six in 2016, according to Pew Research.\n\nTo be sure, India's $283bn IT sector faces a reckoning with its reliance on shuttling skilled workers to the US, which accounts for over half its revenue.\n\nH-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers\n\nIT industry body Nasscom believes the visa fee hike could \"disrupt business continuity for certain onshore projects\". Clients are likely to push for repricing or delay projects until legal uncertainties are cleared, while companies may rethink staffing models - shifting work offshore, reducing onshore roles and becoming far more selective in sponsorship decisions.\n\nIndian firms are also likely to pass on the increased visa costs to US clients, says Aditya Narayan Mishra of CIEL HR, a leading staffing firm.\n\n\"With employers reluctant to commit to the heavy cost of sponsorship, we could see greater reliance on remote contracting, offshore delivery and gig workers.\"\n\nThe broader impact on the US could be severe: hospitals facing doctor shortages, universities struggling to attract STEM students, and start-ups without the lobbying muscle of Google or Amazon are likely to be hit hardest.\n\n\"It [visa fee hike] will force US companies to radically change their hiring policies and offshore a significant amount of their work. It will also ban founders and CEOs coming to manage US-based businesses. It will deal a devastating blow to US innovation and competitiveness,\" David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, told BBC.\n\nThat anxiety is echoed by other experts. \"The demand for new workers in fields like tech and medicine [in US] is projected to increase (albeit in uneven ways), and given how specialised and critical these fields are, a shortage that lasts even a few years could have a serious impact on the US economy and national well-being,\" says Mr Guerra.\n\n\"It will likely also incentivise more skilled Indian workers to look at other countries for international study and have a cascading effect on the American university system as well.\"\n\nThe impact, in fact, will be felt most sharply by Indian students, who make up one in four international students in the US.\n\nSudhanshu Kaushik, founder of the North American Association of Indian Students, which represents 25,000 members across 120 universities, says the timing - just after September enrolments - has left many new arrivals stunned.\n\n\"It felt like a direct attack, because the fees are already paid, so there's a big sunk cost of anywhere between $50,000 and $100,000 per student - and the most lucrative route to entering the American workforce has now been obliterated,\" Mr Kaushik told the BBC.\n\nHe predicts the ruling will hit US university intake next year, as most Indian students opt for countries where they can \"put down permanent roots\".\n\nFor now, the full impact of the tax hike remains uncertain.\n\nImmigration lawyers expect Trump's move to face legal challenges soon. Mr Guerra warns that the fallout could be uneven: \"I expect the new H-1B policy will bring a number of negative consequences for the US, though it will take some time to see what those may be.\"\n\n\"For example, given that the executive order allows for certain companies to be excepted, it could be possible that some heavy H-1B users such as Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta will find a way to be exempted from the H-1B fee policy. If they all get exemptions, however, this would largely defeat the purpose of the fee.\"\n\nAs the dust settles, the H-1B shake-up looks less like a tax on foreign workers and more like a stress test for US companies - and the economy. H-1B visa holders and their families contribute roughly $86bn annually to the US economy, including $24bn in federal payroll taxes and $11bn in state and local taxes.\n\nHow companies respond will determine whether the US continues to lead in innovation and talent - or cedes ground to more welcoming economies."

The pathways, set to begin in mid-2026, aim to help employers retain valuable workers and recognize practical skills in trades and technical roles. This initiative comes amid a record exodus of New Zealand citizens and growing concerns about immigration policies that may inadvertently lead to further emigration to Australia.",

                "text": "New Zealand is making it easier for migrant workers to come and live in the country, in its latest attempt to bolster the workforce and economy.\n\nAnnouncing two new residency pathways, the minister for economic growth, Nicola Willis, on Tuesday said skilled and experienced migrants could help plug gaps in the workforce.\n\n\u201cBusinesses told us it was too hard for some migrants to gain residence, even when they had crucial skills and significant experience that was not available in the existing workforce,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe push for foreign workers and investment comes at a time when record numbers of New Zealanders are leaving the country and amid shrinking GDP.\n\nThe residency pathways will be introduced from mid-2026. One pathway is for migrants in skilled roles who meet relevant experience and salary thresholds. The second is for migrants in trades and technical roles who meet qualification, work experience and wage thresholds.\n\nImmigration minister Erica Stanford said the skilled work experience pathway was designed to help employers retain experienced workers \u201cwho are already contributing to New Zealand\u2019s economy and have demonstrated value in their roles\u201d.\n\nThe trades and technicians pathway recognises the practical skills needed in industries where qualifications obtained outside university are used and valued, she said.\n\nNew Zealand citizens are leaving the country in record numbers. Between July 2024-2025, 73,400 New Zealanders left, compared with 25,800 returning home to live, according to Stats NZ.\n\nIn January, the government relaxed its visitor visa rules to attract so-called \u201cdigital nomads\u201d\u2013 people who work remotely while travelling \u2013 to work in New Zealand. The visa extends to influencers, as long as they are being paid by an overseas company.\n\nIn February, the government loosened the requirements for its Active Investor Plus visa \u2013 commonly known as the golden visa \u2013 which offers residency to wealthy foreigners.\n\nBusiness New Zealand welcomed the latest change in settings, saying the new pathways will enable employers to retain skilled workers, while Infrastructure NZ called for a more urgent start date.\n\nBut minor coalition partner New Zealand First broke with the government, choosing to invoke the \u2018agree to disagree\u2019 clause for what it said was an \u201cunfocused immigration proposal\u201d.\n\n\u201cNew Zealand is being used as a stepping stone into Australia,\u201d said Winston Peters, the party\u2019s leader and minister of foreign affairs.\n\n\u201cWe take them in, train them, up-skill them, look after their families, and then they emigrate.\u201d\n\nOf New Zealand citizens who migrated to Australia in 2024, 35% were born outside New Zealand, according to Stats NZ.\n\n\u201cWe need a smart immigration system that focuses on the needs of employers in New Zealand, industry, and kiwi workers \u2013 not policies that will lead to more immigration with no plan for our next generation.\u201d"

Petraeus later served as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\nAfter his release, al-Sharaa established the al-Nusra Front in Syria in 2012 to fight al-Assad. Four years later, it severed its ties with al-Qaeda. A year later, al-Nusra merged with other groups to form Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), led by al-Sharaa.\n\nHTS was designated a \u201cterrorist organisation\u201d by the US in 2018, citing past ties to al-Qaeda, a designation the US revoked in July as Washington softened its approach to post-Assad Syria.\n\nThe US had placed a $10m bounty on al-Sharaa\u2019s head, lifting it only in late December.\n\nSignificance of timing and venue\n\nAl-Sharaa arrived in New York on Sunday to attend the United Nations General Assembly, the first Syrian head of state to do so in almost six decades.\n\nThe president and his large delegation held meetings, including with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and the leader addressed events on the sidelines of the General Assembly on Monday.\n\nWith Petraeus, he then participated in the 2025 Concordia Annual Summit, a global affairs forum held alongside the General Assembly that brings together world leaders, business executives and NGO figures to foster public-private partnerships and dialogue.\n\nLast year, Concordia said it had more than 300 speakers, including nine heads of state, and more than 3,600 attendees from 112 countries. Past participants include UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, US business titan Warren Buffett and former US President Joe Biden.\n\nWhy is Petraeus a \u2018fan\u2019 of al-Sharaa?\n\nThe former US general not only acknowledged the odd pairing but used it to praise al-Sharaa, who has set an October date for parliamentary elections in Syria.\n\n\u201cHis trajectory from insurgent leader to head of state has been one of the most dramatic political transformations in recent Middle Eastern history,\u201d Petraeus told the audience.\n\nLater in the interview, he showed concern for the Syrian leader\u2019s personal wellbeing, asking whether he is getting enough sleep. Petraeus said al-Sharaa has \u201cmany fans\u201d and that he is one of them.\n\n\u201cAt a time, we were in combat and now we move to discourse,\u201d al-Sharaa said with a smile when asked about their history, adding that people who have gone through war know the importance of peace.\n\n\u201cWe cannot judge the past based on the rules of today and cannot judge today based on the rules of the past,\u201d the Syrian president said.\n\nTalking about his time as an al-Qaeda commander, al-Sharaa said \u201cmaybe there were mistakes\u201d before but what matters now is defending the Syrian people and the region from instability.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to that line is what brought us here today to [New York], sitting here among allies and friends.\u201d\n\nAl-Sharaa said he believed he was fighting for a \u201cnoble\u201d cause that deserves support.\n\nAsked about deadly sectarian violence in Syria this year, he said the al-Assad regime had left Syria in chaos and \u201call parties made mistakes, including parts of the government\u201d, during the violence.\n\nHe added that a newly formed council is investigating and would prosecute all violators.\n\nHe said the Syrian people have rallied around the new government and the economic development and unification of Syria are the priorities now.\n\nIn this vein, he reiterated his request for the US Congress to revoke the Caesar Syria Civil Protection Act of 2019, which sanctions Syria.\n\nThe president reiterated his stance on protecting Syria\u2019s minorities, including the Kurdish population in the north, whose rights must be protected in the constitution. However, he added, Kurdish armed forces must not operate outside the state\u2019s auspices as the government and its army must be the only entity with guns.\n\nThe Syrian leader talked about Israel as well, pointing out that Israel has attacked Syria more than 1,000 times since al-Assad fell and continues to occupy the Golan Heights.\n\nHowever, al-Sharaa said Syria is focused on rebuilding and avoiding another war, so security talks are under way with Israel to reach an agreement based on a 1974 disengagement deal that was mediated by the US."

But our greatest joy will come when there are no [political] prisoners in Egypt,\u201d she added.\n\nBritish foreign secretary Yvette Cooper welcomed the news, saying: \u201cI\u2019m grateful to President Sisi for this decision. We look forward to Alaa being able to return to the UK, to be reunited with his family.\u201d\n\nEgypt\u2019s National Council for Human Rights, a state-funded body, also welcomed the decision, saying it signalled a growing emphasis on swift justice.\n\nPeter Greste, an Australian journalist who was imprisoned alongside Abd el-Fattah, told Australian Associated Press: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely wonderful news, I\u2019m absolutely overjoyed, I think it vindicates all the work and the efforts of the people who lined up behind him.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s one of the most egregious cases of political imprisonment that I know, Alaa is an extraordinary human being who never should have been imprisoned in the first place.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just overjoyed because I know better than anyone what that feeling is like and I can\u2019t wait to speak in person,\u201d he added.\n\nProf Greste had participated in a hunger strike alongside Abd el-Fattah\u2019s mother in London in January to bring attention to his case.\n\nAmnesty International\u2019s Erika Guevara Rosas said the release was welcome but long overdue. \u201cHis pardon ends a grave injustice and is a testament to the tireless efforts of his family and lawyers, including his courageous mother Laila Soueif and activists all over the world who have been relentlessly demanding his release,\u201d she said.\n\nThe UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, is known to have telephoned Sisi three times to lobby for Abd el-Fattah\u2019s release. His national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, also called for his release as did the former foreign secretary David Lammy. It appears a growing warmth in British-Egyptian official relations \u2013 including over how to handle the Palestine question \u2013 may have played a role in the president\u2019s decision.\n\nAbd el-Fattah\u2019s 69-year-old mother was admitted to hospital in London twice after going on hunger strikes to try to secure his release. The prominent activist and maths professor also held vigils outside the Foreign Office and Downing Street, saying she was prepared to die to achieve her son\u2019s release.\n\nThe campaign was also led by Abd el-Fattah\u2019s two sisters, Mona and Sanaa, and other family members. They tried to keep a low profile once the possibility of his release became known, fearing that anything they might say could upset a delicate process. After hearing news of her brother\u2019s impeding release, Mona issued a short tweet in Arabic saying: \u201cMy heart will explode.\u201d\n\nAbd el-Fattah\u2019s pardon was reported by al-Qahera News, which is linked to Egypt\u2019s intelligence service. It said: \u201cThe Egyptian president issues a pardon for the remainder of the prison sentence for a number of convicted persons, after taking the constitutional and legal procedures in this regard. The pardon includes \u2026 Alaa Ahmed Seif El-Islam Abd el-Fattah.\u201d\n\nThe human rights council had recommended seven prisoners for release but its recommendations are not always followed.\n\nThe chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Emily Thornberry, said: \u201cI am absolutely delighted to hear Alaa has received a pardon.\n\n\u201cLaila, Mona, Sanaa and Alaa\u2019s entire family\u2019s tireless campaign for his release has been incredibly moving. Their love for him was clear when I met Sanaa last year. I am so glad they will get to see him come home.\u201d\n\nA writer and supporter of the Arab spring, Abd el-Fattah has been in jail since 2019. In 2021, he was sentenced to five years but the authorities claimed the two years he spent in pre-trial detention did not count toward his sentence. He was convicted of spreading false news and harming Egypt\u2019s national interest.

But our greatest joy will come when there are no [political] prisoners in Egypt,\" she added.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday morning, his sister Mona said she was \"impatiently waiting for the time to come and preparing to go to the airport to take the plane and go see Alaa\".\n\n\"It has been the longest 12 years of this madness, and nightmare and heartache, and also journey full of love and ups and downs. And now Alaa is out, Alaa is free, Alaa is home.\"\n\nHer brother first rose to prominence during the 2011 uprising in Egypt that forced long-time President Hosni Mubarak to resign.\n\nHe has spent most of his time in prison since 2014, the year after Sisi led the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Morsi, following anti-government protests.\n\nWhile in power, Sisi has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that has led to the detention of tens of thousands of people.\n\nIn 2015, a court sentenced Abdel Fattah to five years in prison for participating in an unauthorised protest.\n\nIn September 2019, only six months after he had been released on probation, he was arrested again and held in pre-trial detention for more than two years.\n\nHe was convicted in December 2021 of \"spreading false news\" for sharing a post about a prisoner dying of torture and handed another five-year sentence following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair.\n\nAlthough Abdel Fattah acquired British citizenship in 2021, Egypt never allowed him a consular visit by British diplomats.\n\nIn May, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention - a panel of independent human rights experts \u2013 found that Abdel Fattah had been arbitrarily arrested for exercising his right to freedom of expression, had not been given a fair trial and had remained in detention for his political opinions.\n\nThe Egyptian government said he had been afforded \"all fair trial rights\" and that his sentence would be completed in January 2027.\n\nBut two weeks ago, Sisi unexpectedly ordered authorities to study a petition from Egypt's National Council for Human Rights (NCHR) for the release of Abdel Fattah and six others, which the institution said it had submitted \"in light of the humanitarian and health conditions experienced by [their] families\".\n\nIt gave no details but Leila Soueif was twice admitted to hospital in London during her extensive hunger strike, which she ended in July after receiving assurances from the UK government that it was doing everything it could to secure her son's release.\n\nMona Seif praised the \"enormous solidarity\" with her family's campaign across the world, as well as the pressure applied by the UK government and British MPs. But she said she believed it was her mother's \"terrible and terrifying, but also incredible\" hunger strike that ultimately led to the presidential pardon.\n\nShe said she did not yet know whether her brother would be allowed to leave Egypt to be reunited with his 13-year-old son, Khaled, who lives in Brighton.\n\n\"[Alaa] missed all his childhood. He needs to be with Khaled as a teenager, to take Khaled to school, to take Khaled to the beach, to do all the things they have been robbed of the opportunity to do.\"\n\nShe also said her brother's release was \"not just about a personal moment\".\n\n\"I'm hoping it can be a moment of collective hope,\" she explained. \"There might be a revision to the state of the thousands and thousands of people who are languishing in prison for years and are waiting for the same kind of happiness, to be reunited with their family,\" she added.\n\nThe NCHR said the pardon was \"a step that underscores a growing commitment to reinforcing the principles of swift justice and upholding fundamental rights and freedoms\", while Egyptian human rights lawyer Ahmed Ragheb said he hoped it would \"pave the way for granting amnesty to those who have been sentenced in cases related to freedom of expression\"."

Their case is part of a larger issue where over 100 US-born children have been left without parental care due to aggressive immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, which has abandoned previous policies aimed at humane treatment during deportations. Many undocumented parents have been swiftly deported, often without adequate time to arrange care for their children, leading to a growing crisis affecting the lives and well-being of these children.",

And they didn\u2019t hear an officer tell their mom, Kenia, that they would be picked up by Child Protective Services and placed into foster care if she couldn\u2019t find someone to take care of them.\n\nAll they knew was that their mother, their only parent since their father died five years ago, was being taken from them.\n\nAcross the country, US-born children like Febe and Angelo have become collateral damage in the Trump administration\u2019s unprecedented crackdown on undocumented immigrants.\n\nCNN identified more than 100 US citizen children, from newborns to teenagers, who have been left stranded without parents because of immigration actions this year, according to a review of verified crowdfunding campaigns, public records and interviews with families, friends, immigration attorneys and other advocates.\n\nThese cases have unfolded as the Trump administration has abandoned the \u201chumane enforcement\u201d of immigration laws when deporting mothers and fathers who entered the country illegally, according to policy documents.\n\nSince President Donald Trump took office in January, American children across the country have ended up in the care of relatives, neighbors, friends, co-workers and even strangers. Their parents were picked up during raids on workplaces ranging from farms to meatpacking plants, coming out of check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement or dropping their kids off at school.\n\nIn some cases, ICE appears to have violated protections that still remain in official policies by failing to allow undocumented parents time to find an appropriate caregiver or to make travel plans for their children as they are taken into custody and deported, CNN found. Unlike immigrant children, American children of immigrants do not fall within ICE\u2019s jurisdiction and are not tracked by the agency.\n\nAn ICE spokesperson did not provide any data on how many cases the agency is aware of where US citizen children have been separated from their parents and would not comment on the removal of \u201chumane\u201d from official ICE policies. The spokesperson claimed that ICE \u201cgoes out of its way\u201d to give parents the opportunity to designate a guardian or have their children accompany them upon removal.\n\n\u201cCNN is trying to obscure the fact that each of the illegal alien parents they are defending willingly chose to break our nation\u2019s criminal and administrative laws and as a result of those choices, are responsible for what happens to their children \u2013 just as any U.S. citizen parent who breaks the law is when they are taken to jail,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nAccounts gathered by CNN included an autistic 11-year-old who was placed in foster care in Nebraska when her father was picked up by ICE in June, and a 10-month-old left with family friends when her single mother was arrested during a workplace raid at a cannabis farm in Southern California in July. In Michigan, the oldest daughter of four reportedly scrapped plans to attend college in the fall so she could raise her three younger siblings after their widowed father was detained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s literally a kid\u2019s worst nightmare having someone come take your parents in the middle of the night,\u201d said Wendy Cervantes, a longtime immigration policy expert who has worked with Democratic and Republican lawmakers to help craft federal policies that protect the children of immigrants. \u201cNo matter the outcome, you are turning a kid\u2019s life upside down.\u201d\n\n\u2018Children at risk\u2019\n\nFederal agents donned riot gear and lobbed flash bang grenades and smoke bombs at protesters as they raided a pair of cannabis farms near the California coast this summer. When the smoke cleared, multiple employees were left injured and a worker fleeing one of the facilities plummeted 30 feet from the roof of a greenhouse to his death.\n\nThe raids made headlines for the chaotic and deadly scene that unfolded, as well as reports that a protestor fired at ICE agents.\n\nWhat went largely unnoticed was just how many US citizen children \u2014 more than a dozen, according to CNN\u2019s analysis \u2014 were left without parents to care for them.\n\nOne 15-year-old ended up on his own with his two younger brothers, 8 and 9, when his mother was arrested, her immigration attorney told CNN. From detention, the mother had told the attorney she wanted to see her children as soon as possible. But she was deported to Mexico only three days after the raid.\n\nMartita Martinez-Bravo and her small nonprofit organization, Friends of Fieldworkers, have been attempting to fill in some of the gaps \u2014 gathering donations and delivering diapers, formula, clothes and toys to those in need. Since the raids, which swept up more than 300 undocumented workers, Martinez-Bravo\u2019s phone constantly rings. Many families contacting her have had their primary or sole income-earner ripped away, leaving the remaining parent without a way to pay rent and other bills.\n\nShe said some of the most alarming calls have come from people who are now unexpectedly caring for children. She recalled one call about a babysitter who showed up to one of the farms with two babies in her arms the morning after the raid. Their parents had never come home, Martinez-Bravo said she was told.\n\n\u201cThere is no government support, so all the support that is happening is from nonprofit groups and families,\u201d said Martinez-Bravo. \u201cIt\u2019s leaving children at risk.\u201d\n\nMartinez-Bravo wore a cheerful, embroidered red blouse on a Friday afternoon last month when she dropped off a large Target bag full of supplies \u2014 including toothbrushes, toothpaste and Lysol wipes \u2014 at a one-bedroom apartment where seven people had been living for more than a month.\n\nThe apartment had been tight when it was just a family of four living there \u2013 two farmworkers and their two children. But then the couple took in three more children \u2013 their niece and two nephews \u2013 when those kids\u2019 parents were detained and quickly deported.\n\nThe aunt and uncle struggled to pay for food and rent, and their landlord told them too many people were living in the small apartment. The stress had become so great that the aunt \u2014 who is also undocumented \u2014 kept getting headaches. Just the week prior, she ended up in the hospital, she said.\n\nWhen she could no longer afford a babysitter for the youngest of the children, she said, a family friend drove the 2-year-old boy \u2014 a US citizen \u2014 across the border to live with his father in Tijuana, Mexico. The father said he had come to the United States days after he found his own father shot dead in his house in Mexico. He said he and his son are now sharing a room with a roommate while his wife stays with her family thousands of miles away. He found a job on a farm and works six days a week, but nets less than $20 a day. After paying for child care, it\u2019s a struggle to afford food and diapers, he said.\n\nBack in California, the aunt says she worries about being separated from her own children, a teenager and 4-year-old, who were both born in the US and are citizens. She wants a better future for them, one where they don\u2019t come home from long days picking produce, caked in mud like her and their father.\n\n\u201cNow I feel sad for everything happening,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cWhat happens if ICE takes me?\u201d\n\nA new kind of family separation\n\nPrevious immigration crackdowns had primarily focused on immigrants who had violent criminal records or were recent arrivals.\n\nBut now, as immigration agents scramble to meet the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive quotas of 3,000 arrests a day, many immigrants who have lived in the country a decade or longer with no criminal records are being arrested, detained and deported \u2014 often within a matter of weeks or even days.\n\nMany parents in the cases CNN identified had dutifully attended immigration appointments, paid taxes and received work permits and other authorization to remain in the country, according to interviews and records from parents, families and attorneys.\n\nIn prior policy documents, ICE noted that there were \u201climited circumstances in which detention is appropriate\u201d for parents. While it was not unheard of under past administrations for immigrant parents to end up deported, ICE has historically given agents \u201cdiscretion\u201d to prevent children from being separated from their sole caregivers.\n\nICE has taken a different approach under Trump\u2019s second term. The administration\u2019s \u201cborder czar,\u201d Tom Homan, has repeatedly said parents are to blame for entering the country illegally and having children here without being documented. \u201cIf (you\u2019re) in the country illegally and you choose to have a US citizen child, that\u2019s on you,\u201d Homan told Politico in July. \u201cIf we want to send a message to the whole world \u2026 go have a US citizen child and you\u2019re immune \u2026 we\u2019re never going to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nICE echoed this in its statement to CNN, saying that even if an undocumented immigrant attends immigration appointments, pays taxes or receives authorization to work in the US, they \u201care not absolved of their original offense of illegally entering the country.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s \u201cDetained Parents Directive,\u201d meanwhile, has been changed to weaken protections for undocumented parents, most notably removing a written commitment to pursue \u201chumane enforcement\u201d of deportation laws. Instead, the guidance states that agents should \u201cremain cognizant of the impact enforcement actions may have on a minor child.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s updated policy still provides that undocumented parents should be given time to find an appropriate caregiver or to make travel plans for their children. Yet, some detained parents have alleged they were not given such accommodations, according to immigration attorneys and accounts detailed in interviews and online fundraisers.\n\nIn one case, a young girl was placed in foster care despite having family members who were willing to care for her, according to a nonprofit. In others, parents were deported so quickly that there wasn\u2019t enough time for them to secure passports for their children to be able to join them.\n\n\u201cThis ICE is not using their discretion,\u201d said Heidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cThe checks and balances that used to exist are gone.\u201d\n\nIn Honduras and Guatemala \u2014 two countries many undocumented immigrants are being deported to \u2014 parents are arriving without their US citizen children and saying they weren\u2019t given the option to bring them, researchers from the nonprofit advocacy group Women\u2019s Refugee Commission said after visiting both places.\n\n\u201cSome parents were showing up inconsolable because they did not know where their children were or who was caring for them,\u201d said Zain Lakhani, the group\u2019s director of migrant rights and justice. \u201cThis is the new family separation crisis.\u201d\n\nIn its statement, ICE said parents are given the opportunity to designate a guardian to care for their children or to have their children accompany them when they are deported. \u201cThat decision is entirely up to the illegal alien parents, and they are given a reasonable amount of time to make that decision,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nCiting the increasing likelihood that undocumented parents could end up in ICE custody, nonprofits have been holding community workshops to help parents consider their options, such as designating guardians for their children in the event they are separated. Lawmakers in several states have also recently introduced legislation to make it easier for parents to designate appropriate caregivers if they are taken.\n\n\u201cWe are witnessing families being torn apart in real time \u2014 parents detained, unable to pick up their children from school and childcare,\u201d Democratic California Assemblywoman Celeste Rodriguez said in a statement about legislation that is currently awaiting the governor\u2019s signature. \u201cThis bill is not just about planning; it\u2019s about creating a safety net.\u201d\n\nLasting trauma\n\nMimi Lettunich was in the middle of work when she received a call from an immigration agent asking her whether she could pick up her friend Jackie Merlos\u2019 four children. Merlos was being detained, and if she didn\u2019t immediately find a US citizen to take her kids, they would end up in foster care.\n\nWithin hours, Lettunich found herself driving along the highway with 9-year-old triplets and their 7-year-old brother to care for indefinitely.\n\nThe children sat stunned in the back seat. Lettunich herself was trying to wrap her mind around what was happening, she told CNN. She couldn\u2019t understand why immigration authorities would take away Merlos and her husband, well-regarded local business owners who had come to Portland, Oregon, from Honduras decades ago.\n\nLettunich hadn\u2019t cared for young children in years \u2014 her own kids were now grown up. And she had a full-time job. As they drove to her Portland home, she realized she and her husband hadn\u2019t even started to think about what they needed or how this was all going to work: Did they have toothbrushes? Where were they going to sleep? What were they going to have for dinner? How do we make sure they feel comfortable but also give them their space?\n\nThat first night at Lettunich\u2019s, the children slept in their clothes because they didn\u2019t have pajamas. She comforted them before bed, telling them they were safe and reading them stories. She told them they could think of this as \u201csummer camp,\u201d and the kids now call it \u201cCamp Reindeer\u201d because of how many deer they see in the backyard. In the days and then weeks that have followed, she and her husband have taken the kids swimming, to the zoo and out to dinner \u2014 anything to try to cheer them up. Because they have had to keep working too, they enrolled the children in day camps, and they often visit their parents in detention on the weekends.\n\nBut Lettunich said she worries every day about the impacts that they will be coping with for the rest of their lives because of the ordeal. \u201cThey fear for their parents,\u201d she said. \u201cThey ask, \u2018are Mom and Dad not coming home?\u2019\u201d\n\nOne of the kids has been keeping everything bottled up, she said. He doesn\u2019t want to hear anything about what happened or talk about it, only wanting to \u201cthink of happy things.\u201d And all of the children have started talking with a psychiatrist to try to begin processing the trauma, she said.\n\nLess than three hours away in her cell at an ICE detention center in Tacoma, Washington, their mother, Jackie Merlos, is grappling with her own emotions, writing regular journal entries about her experience and her worries. US Customs and Border Protection, which initially detained Merlos and her husband, told CNN she was arrested \u201cas she attempted to smuggle illegal aliens into the United States\u201d and that formal removal proceedings were underway. Neither Merlos nor her husband has been charged with a crime related to this allegation, however, and Merlos has said she and her family were simply meeting her sister \u2014 a Canadian resident \u2014 at a park along the US-Canada border. ICE did not comment.\n\nIt has been more than 70 days since Merlos was separated from her kids, and her next court date isn\u2019t until the middle of October.\n\n\u201cI feel powerless not being able to see or hug my children, play with them, and watch them grow,\u201d she wrote a week after her children were separated from her. \u201cI\u2019m suffering, and my children are suffering psychologically. It\u2019s not fair to separate children from their mom and dad.\u201d\n\nSometimes Merlos convinces herself that what is happening is just a nightmare that she will wake up from. \u201cMy life feels meaningless without them,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBut until the whole family is reunited, she urged her children to keep praying and to continue living their lives without her.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t stop practicing your piano (David), guitar (Carlitos), violin (Abigail), and piano (Caleb),\u201d Merlos wrote.\n\nAn untracked issue\n\nPleas for donations to help stranded children have been popping up online since immigration efforts ramped up earlier this year.\n\nIn some cases, the children themselves are asking for financial support to help pay for food, rent and utility bills. Teenagers describe being left on their own with younger siblings, and recent high school graduates say they have dropped out of college and returned home in the hopes of keeping their siblings housed, fed and out of the care of strangers.\n\n\u201cMy mother is the most hard working woman I know, she is a single mother of 3 and has worked for us to always have everything we need and everything she\u2019s had worked for her whole life was just taken away from her,\u201d a daughter wrote in a July fundraiser. \u201cTruly anything helps.\u201d\n\nBecause the number of kids left behind by the ongoing ICE raids and deportation efforts is not being publicly tracked, CNN used the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe as a way to provide a snapshot of the issue, as well as interviews with families and attorneys, who confirmed additional cases to reporters. CNN\u2019s count of more than 100 US citizen children does not include dozens of children whose citizenship status or age was unclear, or where fundraisers couldn\u2019t be verified.\n\nThe fundraising accounts, which GoFundMe confirmed to CNN had been verified by the company\u2019s trust and safety team, also served as a window into where separated children have ended up. Some were taken into foster care. Most were being cared for by family friends, community members or relatives.\n\nICE said it couldn\u2019t comment on CNN\u2019s analysis because it included anonymous families and some of the information had come from what it called \u201cnotoriously biased and unreliable\u201d crowdfunding websites. The spokesperson did not respond to questions about how often children were ending up in this situation or whether this was something being internally tracked by the agency.\n\nImmigration experts said said it is difficult to fully assess how widespread the issue is until the federal government comprehensively tracks and releases that data. There are millions of US citizen children living in households where their only parent or both parents are undocumented, Brookings Institution research shows.\n\nAttorneys told CNN about cases ranging from an 8-year-old who allegedly watched her single mother get handcuffed and taken away by ICE to a one-year-old who is currently living with a foster family as the toddler\u2019s mom fights for custody from detention.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stunning that we\u2019re putting so much emphasis on hitting deportation numbers, and not thinking about all the collateral damage we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Leecia Welch, deputy litigation director at nonprofit Children\u2019s Rights, who has been visiting families in immigrant detention centers to monitor conditions. \u201cWe\u2019re traumatizing everybody involved in these situations and completely destabilizing their lives and causing long-term trauma.\u201d\n\n\u2018It terrifies me\u2019\n\nIt was around 6:30 in the morning when Kenia Perez arrived home from her overnight shift at the hospital.\n\nShe had stopped at the store to get milk for her daughter\u2019s cereal and was planning to go inside and wake her kids up and get them ready for school, when she saw two large, unfamiliar cars parked outside her apartment.\n\nICE agents were waiting for her.\n\n\u201cRun away as far as you can,\u201d she texted her 14-year-old son, Isaac, who jumped out the window. Since Isaac was also undocumented, she worried ICE would take him too \u2014 leaving Febe and Angelo without any family in the country.\n\nAgents in tactical vests and local police officers surrounded her in the parking lot.\n\nDesperate to keep her children out of foster care, her next call was to Jeff Chaney, a family friend and coworker who had agreed just a day earlier to take guardianship of the children if ICE came for her \u2014 something she had become increasingly nervous about under the Trump administration.\n\nPerez had been in the US for roughly a decade, fleeing cartel violence in her native Honduras. She described to CNN how she was assaulted, raped and left in a dumpster on her journey. She was pregnant when she was apprehended at the border and records show she was released under an order requiring regular check-ins with ICE. She met and married her husband in the years that followed and created a family in Galveston, Texas. Only months after she gave birth to her third child, her husband passed away from Covid in 2020, and she suddenly became the sole caregiver for her three children \u2014 two of whom, Febe and Angelo, are US citizens.\n\nPerez said she paid taxes and documents show that she never missed a check-in with ICE. Her work permit is not set to expire until the spring of 2026. But ICE came for her anyway.\n\nUnlike other cases examined by CNN, Perez said she was allowed to go into her apartment, wake her children, and tell them goodbye.\n\n\u201cI need you to be strong,\u201d she remembers telling Febe and Angelo. \u201cYou see those men. They\u2019re going to take Mom.\u201d\n\nPerez prayed she would be able to take her children with her to Honduras. Even though she knew it would be dangerous, she couldn\u2019t imagine being separated.\n\nBut she was deported 11 days after her arrest, leaving her friend, Chaney, trying to lighten the kids\u2019 moods. He took them to IHOP on the weekends and held movie nights at his house.\n\nChaney couldn\u2019t keep the kids at his house given the long hours he worked at his two jobs, so the children spent several days bouncing around among a network of Perez\u2019s coworkers\u2019 homes until one of her undocumented friends gave them a place to stay, at least temporarily. Because the kids didn\u2019t have access to any of the funds Perez had saved from her job, community members began supporting the family through a GoFundMe campaign.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Chaney said that when he voted for Trump last year, he understood that immigration enforcement was a top priority for his administration. He supported the Republican Party\u2019s promise to secure the border and to go after criminals and gang members.\n\nBut he never imagined that someone like Perez, his close friend and co-worker, would end up caught in the crackdown.\n\n\u201cThis is not what I voted for,\u201d he said, adding that he never supported the targeting of working-class people who had been doing everything right. \u201cYou don\u2019t do this. This is inhumane what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nAn ICE spokesperson told CNN Perez asked to be reunited with her children before she was deported, but that she refused to provide agents with their specific location. Perez told CNN she did not want to endanger any of her undocumented friends who were helping to care for her kids when she was first arrested, but that she had hoped that while she was in detention, she would have an opportunity to secure their passports so that they could be reunited when she was deported. \u201cAfter exhausting all efforts, ICE proceeded with her removal in accordance with federal law,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe spokesperson described Perez as an \u201cirresponsible parent,\u201d who \u201cchose to use her children as a bargaining chip in an attempt to prevent her own removal from the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny claims by her now that ICE improperly separated her from her kids are patently false and just another attempt to manipulate the system for her own benefit,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nFrom a small home on a dirt road in a neighborhood of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, known for gang violence, Perez called her kids every night, telling them everything was going to be OK. Her daughter\u2019s dolls and her son\u2019s toys sat waiting for them, along with two spots next to her in her bed.\n\nMore than two months after she was deported, Perez was finally able to secure the paperwork and passports needed for Febe and Angelo to reunite with her in Honduras, where her oldest son had also joined her. But she told CNN she worries about her children and the life they will have in one of the most violent countries in the world.\n\n\u201cIt terrifies me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the decisions I\u2019m making, but I\u2019m tied hand and foot.\u201d\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nCNN\u2019s analysis, which provided a snapshot of the number of US citizen children being stranded by ICE actions, included accounts from interviews with families, attorneys and nonprofit organizations, as well as fundraisers from the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe. CNN provided GoFundMe with a list of roughly 150 campaigns to confirm which fundraisers had been verified by the company\u2019s Trust & Safety Team as part of its standard verification process, and reporters contacted the organizers and family members. The count does not include dozens of children whose citizenship status or age was unclear, or where fundraisers couldn\u2019t be verified.\n\nCNN\u2019s Abel Alvarado, Norma Galeana and Yahya Abou-Ghazala contributed to this report."

                "article_summary": "Ray, a Nepali-speaking Bhutanese refugee who was deported from the U.S. to Bhutan, where he has never lived, is now hiding in India after being ordered to leave Bhutan within 24 hours of his arrival. He faces extreme hardship and uncertainty, relying on the kindness of a pastor for survival, as U.S. immigration policies have led to the deportation of individuals like him to countries where they face danger and persecution. The situation has reignited trauma in the Nepali-speaking Bhutanese community, many of whom are haunted by past experiences of displacement and fear of further expulsions.",
                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "Whenever Ray finds a working internet connection, his first instinct is to contact his wife and tell her that he's safe \u2014 for now.\n\nRay, who is in his late 20s, was born in a refugee camp in Nepal and came to the U.S. as a kid. He was recently deported to Bhutan \u2014 a tiny Himalayan kingdom that he had never lived in and where his family faced persecution. Within 24 hours of his arrival, Ray said Bhutanese authorities ordered him to leave.\n\nNow, Ray is hiding in India where he has no legal status, family, or passport. He said he is only surviving thanks to a pastor who took him in.\n\n\" I have nothing here. It's desperation right now for me,\" said Ray, who asked to be identified only by his English first name to protect his safety and preserve his chance to appeal his deportation.\n\nFor years, Bhutan refused to accept Nepali-speaking Bhutanese refugees like Ray. But under President Trump's second term, over two dozen people have been deported there, even as Bhutan is accused of turning them away.\n\nU.S. immigration law includes safeguards that prevent deporting people to countries where they may face serious danger. But advocates say the Trump administration has largely abandoned those protections \u2014 pointing to the attempts to send people to Libya and South Sudan, as well as a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nWhile some of those efforts faced legal challenges, the deportations to Bhutan have quietly continued.\n\n\" Our understanding is that families have been verbally told by ICE officers that the government of Bhutan will welcome them, that it's gonna be okay \u2014 and we're really seeing just the opposite,\" said Aisa Villarosa, an attorney with the Asian Law Caucus, a national advocacy and legal aid group that has been closely monitoring the situation.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement and the Consulate of Bhutan did not respond to requests for comment. But in a recent Supreme Court case about third country deportations, U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer argued that noncitizens with criminal records should not be allowed to stay in the U.S. simply because their home countries refuse them.\n\nA mass exodus from Bhutan\n\nMost Nepali-speaking Bhutanese refugees are descendants of Nepali farmers and laborers who journeyed to southern Bhutan in the 19th century. Some have even older roots.\n\nFor the next several decades, they had little interaction with the rest of Bhutan. But as the country sought to modernize and unify, the government enacted policies in the 1980s that targeted ethnic Nepalis' legal status and culture.\n\nProtests erupted, some of which turned violent. As authorities crushed resistance, the situation worsened with hundreds of ethnic Nepalis imprisoned, homes set ablaze, and entire villages uprooted, according to Michael Hutt, an emeritus professor of Nepali and Himalayan studies at SOAS, University of London.\n\n\" People were arrested and told that they could be released as long as they signed a piece of paper to say that they would leave Bhutan and take their family with them,\" Hutt said.\n\nThose unable to provide official proof of citizenship were forced to leave. By the early 1990s, an estimated 100,000 people \u2014 about one sixth of the country's population \u2014 were expelled or fled.\n\nSeven refugee camps were set up in eastern Nepal with the help of the U.N. refugee agency. But refugees were not allowed work permits or citizenship in Nepal, leaving them in limbo. When resettlement efforts began in 2008, the U.S. accepted the most by far \u2014 over 85,000 refugees.\n\nSwept away within minutes\n\nRay moved to the U.S. with his family when he was 12 and grew up in the south. He said he was in awe of how people of different backgrounds coexisted peacefully. It was new to him.\n\nIn his senior year of high school, Ray, a green-card holder at the time, followed his friends in an incident that led to felony burglary and trespassing charges. He called it a \"stupid mistake\" and the biggest regret of his life. He served two years probation. Several years later, immigration authorities sought his deportation.\n\nRay was in ICE custody for a few months but eventually let go. His theory is that Bhutan was not accepting refugees. Over the next few years, he went on to get married, have children, and work in factories and gas stations.\n\nThen, one Sunday morning this March, a group of ICE agents showed up at Ray's doorstep. He said he was rushed out without a chance to hug his wife or two young children, who were asleep.\n\n\"It was just like, probably maximum two minutes,\" he said.\n\nFew return to camps in Nepal, others missing\n\nWhen Ray arrived in Bhutan, he said authorities immediately confiscated his phone and personal documents. Then, he said he was questioned about his family's origins.\n\n\"They tell us that, 'You can't stay here because your language and our language don't match,'\" he recalled.\n\nRay was put in a hotel overnight, he said. The next morning, he and other deportees were ordered to leave the country, he added. He said he pleaded with officials to let him stay while he fought his deportation case, but they refused.\n\nThe Asian Law Caucus (ALC) and Asian Refugees United (ARU), which is focused on empowering Asian youth, said they have been in contact with the families of 27 individuals who were deported to Bhutan in recent months. Many shared similar accounts of their loved ones expelled within a day of arrival. Most also said they have been unable to contact their loved ones ever since, according to Villarosa from ALC.\n\nAt least four deportees have traveled back to the refugee camps in Nepal. There, they also face uncertainty. Only two out of the original seven refugee camps remain today and most of the humanitarian groups have withdrawn, according to Gopal Siwakoti, a human rights activist based in Nepal.\n\n\"In the camp, there is no place to stay because their huts were already dismantled a long time ago,\" he said.\n\nLast month, the Nepali government ruled that the four deportees who returned to the refugee camps cannot remain in the country and must pay a fine until they leave.\n\nDeportations haunt a community scarred by past refugee experiences\n\nBefore this year, ARU's co-founder Robin Gurung from Pennsylvania said the top concern within the Nepali-speaking Bhutanese community was mental health struggles rooted in past refugee experiences. The recent wave of deportations have only made things worse, he added.\n\n\"The fear has re-traumatized our community members who went through a series of displacement and series of traumatic events,\" Gurung said.\n\nBhadra Mishra, who is part of ARU in Ohio, said the deportations have rekindled questions of belonging.\n\n\"When do we have to not fear another expulsion? When can we be free? Truly free?\" she said.\n\nLast month, Mohan Karki, a Nepali-speaking Bhutanese refugee from Ohio, received a temporary stay of deportation over concerns raised about Bhutan \u2014 a small win, according to immigration advocates. His wife, Tika Basnet is hoping Karki will be allowed to stay in the only country they have ever called home.\n\n\" Nepal is not our country. India is not our country,\" she said. \"They never recognized us.\"\n\nIn Ray's absence, his wife has become the sole provider for the family \u2014 working extra shifts at a beauty supply store, while also caring for their children and Ray's aging parents. His children believe their father is away on a business trip.\n\n\"The only thing that keeps me fighting to come back are my wife and kids,\" Ray said. \"I don't wanna see my kids growing up without a father figure.\""

She laughed off one comment about California Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2013 that he told her he was hiking when she called to ask for his endorsement, only to never call back \u2013 and reflected on her comments about not choosing former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as her running mate.\n\nShe also gave cautious backing to Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor who many top party officials have declined to endorse.\n\nWhy she didn\u2019t press Biden\n\nHarris was pressed on the portions of her book she devoted to questioning former Biden\u2019s initial insistence on going through with a reelection campaign despite concerns about his age. She downplayed the idea that she would raise questions to Biden about his choice.\n\n\u201cThere was so much, as we know, at stake. And as I write, you know, the \u2013 where my head was at, at the time, is that it would be completely \u2013 it would come off as being completely self-serving,\u201d Harris continued, downplaying the idea that she would raise questions about Biden\u2019s reelection decision.\n\nNot choosing Buttigieg as her running mate\n\nAnother notable moment in the interview came when Harris was asked about the portion of her book in which she explained her reservations about selecting Buttigieg as her running mate.\n\nHarris wrote that Buttigieg was her first choice, but that because he is gay, she thought it was \u201ctoo big of a risk\u201d to pick him while already asking voters to accept a Black woman as president.\n\nMaddow, who is gay, pressed Harris on that passage, commenting that \u201cto say that he couldn\u2019t be on the ticket effectively because he was gay, it\u2019s hard to hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no, that\u2019s not what I said,\u201d Harris responded. \u201cWith the stakes being so high, it made me very sad, but I also realized it would be a real risk.\u201d\n\nShe went on, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about any prejudice on my part, but that we had such a short period of time. And the stakes were so high. I think Pete is a phenomenal, phenomenal public servant. And I think America is and would be ready for that. But when I had to make that decision with two weeks to go \u2013 you know, and maybe I was being too cautious.\u201d\n\nButtigieg has said he was \u201csurprised\u201d by Harris\u2019 comments in her book, telling Politico, \u201cMy experience in politics has been that the way that you earn trust with voters is based mostly on what they think you\u2019re going to do for their lives, not on categories.\u201d\n\nA tepid endorsement of Mamdani\n\nMamdani\u2019s upset victory in this summer\u2019s New York City primary has left lingering divisions within his party. The 33-year-old state assemblyman and democratic socialist has inspired younger voters but also rankled top Democrats with his criticism of Israel, his proposals to freeze rent on city-stabilized apartments and make public buses free, and his allies\u2019 talk of running primary challengers against Democratic incumbents.\n\nAsked specifically if she would endorse Mamdani, Harris responded, \u201cI support the Democrat in the race.\u201d\n\nShe also added, \u201cLet me just say this, he\u2019s not the only star \u2013 I know that you know, he\u2019s in New York. And I know New Yorkers think they\u2019re the center of the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are people like Barbara Drummond in Mobile, Alabama, Helena Moreno in New Orleans. They\u2019re all running for mayor, too, and they are stars. So I hope that we don\u2019t so over-index on New York City that we lose sight of the stars throughout our country,\u201d Harris commented.\n\nOn Trump and Kimmel\n\nHarris also devoted a significant portion of the interview to excoriating President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, repeatedly calling him a \u201ctyrant\u201d and urging \u201ctitans of industry\u201d to stand up to what she said were anti-democratic actions.\n\n\u201cRight now we are dealing with, as I called him at my speech on the Ellipse, a tyrant,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe used to compare the strength of our democracy to communist dictators. That\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with right now, Donald Trump, and these titans of industry are not speaking up.\u201d\n\nHarris also pointed to the suspension of ABC host Jimmy Kimmel amid controversy over his comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, praising pushback against Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr for implying that his agency would take action against the network if it didn\u2019t address Kimmel.\n\nShe echoed the warnings of former President Barack Obama, who has urged similar resistance from institutions facing crackdowns from the Trump administration, in particular law firms and universities.\n\n\u201cTalk about the power being with the people and the people making that clear with their checkbooks as it relates to the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe saw the power of the people over the last few days, and it spoke volumes, and it moved a decision in the right direction.\u201d\n\nHer future\n\nHarris earlier passed on a bid to run for California governor next year. Asked about a third run for the presidency in 2028, Harris said, \u201cThat\u2019s not my focus right now. It\u2019s not my focus at all. I know \u2013 it really isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe praised Newsom\u2019s effort to launch a statewide referendum that would redraw California\u2019s US House maps in response to Texas\u2019 mid-decade redistricting that could give Republicans as many as five new seats.\n\n\u201cPart of what we\u2019ve got to, I think, challenge ourselves to accept is that we tend to play by the rules. But I think this is a moment where you got to fight fire with fire,\u201d Harris said."

Despite this support within the Democratic Party, the ideology remains unpopular among Republicans and many independents, complicating efforts for socialists to gain traction in battleground areas. The poll highlights the ongoing internal debate among Democrats on how to rebuild the party after recent electoral setbacks, as progressives and moderates seek to define their path forward.",

Even within the Democratic Party, some voters are skeptical about the electability of democratic socialists in swing areas, a reality Sanders faced during his two unsuccessful presidential runs.\n\nDemocrats find themselves in turmoil after the national drubbing they took last year, and have been tussling for months over how to rebuild their party. Progressives and moderates alike have sought to shape the debate through polling, memos and in-person gatherings as they bicker over the path out of the wilderness.\n\nThis survey marks the first formal poll the DSA Fund has released \u2014 the latest example of the left seeking to professionalize its operations and create infrastructure to build on its recent electoral victories. The organization said it plans to share its findings with hundreds of socialists elected around the country.\n\nFifty-three percent of Democratic voters said they preferred politicians described as similar to Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez and Mamdani, while 33 percent favored those similar to Schumer, Jeffries and Pelosi. Fourteen percent didn\u2019t choose.\n\nThough Democratic voters reported viewing elected officials who describe themselves as Democrats or democratic socialists roughly equally, independent and Republican voters saw the socialists far more negatively. Both types of hypothetical politicians were described as having the same affordability-focused agenda.\n\nThe results help explain why socialists and progressives have found success in blue seats and cities \u2014 underscored by Mamdani\u2019s victory in New York City\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary in June \u2014 but have struggled to appeal to swing voters in battleground areas.\n\nIn the poll, democratic socialists were defined as believing \u201cthat the government should take a more active role to improve Americans\u2019 lives. They generally support higher taxes on corporations and high-income earners, support regulations that protect workers and consumers, and want more public ownership of key industries like housing, health care and utilities.\u201d\n\nThe survey described capitalists as believing \u201cthat the private sector is best equipped to make improvements to Americans\u2019 lives. They generally support lower taxes, oppose government regulations of businesses, and want the private sector to own key industries like housing, health care and utilities.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing each description, 74 percent of likely Democratic voters said democratic socialism comes closest to their viewpoint, while 16 percent said the same of capitalism. A plurality of independent voters and a majority of Republicans said they preferred capitalism.\n\nThe survey of 1,257 likely voters nationwide, conducted from Aug. 22 to 24 using web panel respondents, had a 3-point margin of error."

Eyewitnesses say the police shouted \u201cstop\u201d twice before shooting towards the teens.\n\nResident Johnny Inthisone told CBC News that the shooting unfolded only seconds after police warned the youths to stop.\n\nDespite efforts by police and paramedics to revive Rezayi, he was pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\nBishop said Rezayi was struck by at least one bullet and that investigators were conducting a forensic analysis of the gun collected at the scene.\n\nRezayi\u2019s family, who immigrated to Quebec from Afghanistan, say the death of their son has left them with grief and few answers.\n\n\u201cI love my son. I love my baby,\u201d his mother, Fahima, told the Montreal Gazette. \u201cWhy did they shoot my baby?\u201d\n\nRezayi said the family has received almost no information since he was killed. \u201cNothing. They\u2019re not giving me anything,\u201d she said.\n\nThe teen\u2019s father, Sharif, said police didn\u2019t come to the family home until nearly six hours after the shooting. \u201cWe sat here, not knowing. And then they came and told us he was gone,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the Tuesday press conference, Bishop said investigators retrieved a baseball bat and ski masks at the scene but declined to provide further specifics about the case, citing the ongoing investigation. She said five people had been assigned to the case.\n\nBut she warned residents against pursing \u201cprivate investigations\u201d into the shooting.\n\n\u201cA lot of people that are trying to understand what\u2019s going on. I totally understand that, but they\u2019re doing certain private investigations and they\u2019re meeting with people,\u201d she said, calling on anyone with evidence to come forward. \u201cYou have to trust us. We\u2019re the ones who are doing the investigation. We\u2019re an independent office. Our mission is to shed light on what happened and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d"

                "article_summary": "Amy Marin-Franco, a teacher at Robb Elementary School, faced scrutiny after the tragic shooting that claimed 19 children and two teachers, with law enforcement initially blaming her for propping open a door that allowed the shooter access. However, surveillance footage later confirmed that she closed the door after rushing back inside, contradicting claims she had failed to follow protocol. Despite receiving an apology from her school district, Marin-Franco continues to struggle with the aftermath of the shooting and the misinformation surrounding her actions that day, while advocating for the release of surveillance footage to clear her name.",
                "source": "cnn",
                "text": "When teacher Amy Marin-Franco saw a pickup truck crash in a ditch outside her school, her first thought was to get help.\n\nWhen a young man got out of the truck with a gun, she abruptly pivoted \u2014 she still wanted to get help, but now to protect the children and staff inside her school.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a coward,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nBut in the words of law enforcement, she became something worse: someone who had failed to follow protocol and unwittingly helped a murderous teen enter an elementary school where he killed 19 children and two teachers in the deadliest school shooting for a decade.\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t true.\n\nAnd although officials walked back their denunciation of her a few days later, Marin-Franco says the doubts have lingered around her ever since, from neighbor and stranger alike. For weeks after the shooting, she said she did not go anywhere. When she finally went to a school board meeting, she sat at the back, afraid the bereaved families packing the front rows would attack her. To this day, she says people still believe the lie. \u201cI see it every day,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can feel the division, you can feel the people that are, \u2018Hmm, she left the door open.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s even proof on surveillance video of what she did and did not do. Marin-Franco believes this evidence will clear her name forever, but it\u2019s caught up in a yearslong effort by local and state officials in Texas to keep public records hidden.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the video that I\u2019m looking at, because I want to make it a point that I didn\u2019t run straight to my room to hide,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about myself. I was thinking about saving lives.\u201d\n\nIt was May 24, 2022, in the last week of school before the summer holidays at Robb Elementary in Uvalde. The fourth grade had had their awards ceremony earlier in the morning and Marin-Franco was getting ready for a dance party for her after-school students.\n\nShe pushed a wheeled cart from her corner classroom into a hallway adorned with a massive hand-colored \u201cCongrats Class of 2022\u201d poster. As she headed out to the parking lot to get supplies, she nudged a rock to the frame of the side door to stop the door closing fully. It was against district policy, but a common practice among teachers in the building to use the rock as they stepped outside to get something from their cars or take a short break outside.\n\nWhen the truck crashed, Marin-Franco ran back to her classroom to get her phone to call 911. \u201cThere was just an accident right here behind Robb school,\u201d she told the dispatcher as soon as the call was connected, a recording showed.\n\nStill on the phone to give more details, Marin-Franco was heading toward the truck when her voice suddenly changed. First there was confusion about the actions of two men from a nearby funeral home who had also gone to help.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re running, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d she told the dispatcher. Then shock and alarm when she saw the man get out of the truck and shoot at them. \u201cOh my god, he has a gun!\u201d\n\nMarin-Franco ran back to the school building and opened the door. Surveillance video clearly shows her pushing the rock out of the way with the sole of her right foot before slamming the entry door closed.\n\n\u201cThe video shows me running into the building and I close the door. I kick the rock and I close the door,\u201d she told CNN.\n\nA Department of Justice investigation found this action should have locked the door, though there was no way to check from the inside. And CNN revealed maintenance records just this month that showed repeated problems with that entry door, and many other internal and external doors before the shooting.\n\nThe hallway surveillance video shows Marin-Franco banging on a colleague\u2019s door to ask her to get a lockdown initiated while she stays on the phone with the police dispatcher, returning to the entry door to peer outside to try to get more information on the shooter\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m holding the door shut. I have the phone in my left hand and I\u2019m telling her, \u2018Black hoodie, black hair. He threw a gun. He threw a bag. He threw another gun. He jumped the fence.\u2019\u201d\n\nA minute before the gunman walked into her building, Marin-Franco went to her empty classroom, closing the door about 30 seconds before he entered. She had no key to lock it, she said.\n\n\u201cI kept looking to the door to see if the shooter was coming into my room.\u201d Marin-Franco recalled frantic moments as she thought about going into the hallway or finding a place to hide, eventually crouching under a counter in her room.\n\nMarin-Franco whispered to the operator that the shooter was inside the building, before the line cut. \u201cThe rounds are still going off, but after every round, it was total silence,\u201d she said.\n\nShe remembers her mind running wild, accepting her fate while running through scenarios to tackle the shooter.\n\n\u201cAnd then I hear voices. I\u2019m like, \u2018What is that? Those are the cops,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nPolice officers entered the school through the same door as the gunman \u2014 and less than three minutes after him. But after an initial approach during which they came under fire, they lost momentum, waiting for keys or breaching tools or specialist personnel. Much of that time, the first responders huddled at either end of the hallway, many of them outside Marin-Franco\u2019s classroom.\n\nShe waited until, apparently by chance, an officer opened the door to a connecting classroom and escorted her out.\n\n\u201cI never moved until finally, somebody came in, got me out.\u201d\n\nThat was a little more than 20 minutes after officers first entered the school. It would be another 52 minutes before they confronted the gunman and got help for the victims.\n\nThough he crashed his grandparents\u2019 pickup off the campus, the gunman had no trouble getting to the school. He shot at windows and pulled open the door Marin-Franco had slammed shut. And that became a critical point of failure for law enforcement chiefs looking to make the early apportionment of blame.\n\nRobb Elementary School was the softest of soft targets. A 5-foot perimeter fence was no barrier to someone determined to climb over. There was no full-time security. And there were multiple entrances to multiple buildings.\n\nThree days after the shooting, it was becoming clear something had gone hugely wrong in the law enforcement response. Hundreds of officers went to the school, but it took them 77 minutes to shoot and kill the gunman.\n\nRumors and misinformation about what had happened were also rife.\n\nCol. Steve McCraw, then-director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, the lead law enforcement agency in the state, took time to set some of the record straight.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to report the facts as we know them now,\u201d he told reporters on May 27, giving details from video surveillance, 911 calls from inside the classrooms where the shooter was, and evidence that had been collected.\n\nHe ran through a timeline, clarified a police officer had encountered a sports coach and not the shooter outside the school and discussed what the hallway surveillance camera showed \u2014 that Marin-Franco propped the door open to go outside and ran back inside to get her cellphone. But he said nothing about her kicking out the rock and pulling the door closed.\n\nIn response to a question, he went further, saying: \u201cThat back door was propped open. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be propped open. It was supposed to be locked,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, the teacher that went back for her cellphone propped it open again, so that was an access point that the subject used.\u201d\n\nAt home with her daughter, Marin-Franco watched McCraw shred her life, live on TV.\n\n\u201cI looked up at her and I kept saying. \u2018I closed the door. I closed the door,\u2019\u201d Marin-Franco told CNN. \u201cI (was) shaking again uncontrollably. I couldn\u2019t control myself.\u201d\n\nShe felt so unwell, she asked her daughter to take her to the hospital to be checked out.\n\n\u201cThe nurse, she\u2019s taking my vitals, and I\u2019m looking at her, and I\u2019m telling her, \u2018I closed the door, I closed the door,\u2019 and I\u2019m shaking from head to toe,\u201d Marin-Franco recalled. \u201cShe said, \u2018You need to calm down, are you going to faint on me?\u2019 And I looked up at her and I kept saying, \u2018I closed the door. I closed the door.\u2019\u201d\n\nMarin-Franco was visited at the hospital the next day by her supervisor, whom she begged to help her set the record straight. The colleague was there when a Texas Ranger and an FBI agent came to say they had reviewed the video and saw she had pulled the door shut.\n\nThat colleague emailed the leadership of the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District: \u201cAmy is already under much stress from having lived the tragedy that we do not want her to endure any more suffering due to misinformation.\u201d She added: \u201cAmy was adamant about wanting you to know these facts as they related to her.\u201d\n\nA week after the shooting, DPS spokesperson Travis Considine told The Associated Press Marin-Franco\u2019s story had been confirmed. \u201cWe did verify she closed the door. The door did not lock. We know that much and now investigators are looking into why it did not lock,\u201d he said.\n\nMonths later, McCraw acknowledged the error could have been corrected sooner. \u201cI did say the teacher pushed the rock in the door. I said that on that Friday, and didn\u2019t correct it until the next week,\u201d he told a meeting of the state Public Safety Commission in October, 2022, adding: \u201cWhen we found out about it, we certainly corrected it on the record.\u201d\n\nMarin-Franco said a statement was issued to her family, but she has never considered it sufficient. \u201cThey never called me. They never called my kids. They never apologized to me,\u201d she said.\n\nUvalde is a small town, where families and lives are all intertwined. Parents who lost their children still see the officers who waited in the hallway at the grocery store. Some of the responders had children at Robb. Marin-Franco\u2019s grandson was a Robb second grader, in a different building. A school police officer was married to one of the teachers who died. And pretty much everyone knows each other\u2019s business.\n\nMany people knew it was Marin-Franco who was called out by McCraw, even if her name was not used. And as she suffered the reproachful looks and comments, she was also troubled by another small-town connection.\n\nThe week before the massacre, she had grabbed some food at the local Wendy\u2019s, where she was served by a young man who would soon buy two rifles and take them and a stockpile of ammunition into her elementary school.\n\n\u201cHe gave me my food and there was nothing ugly about him. There was nothing evil about him,\u201d Marin-Franco said of how he seemed. Now, she does whatever she can to block his face from her mind.\n\n\u201cWhen I go to sleep \u2014 which is very little \u2014 I try to sleep, and I see his face.\u201d\n\nMarin-Franco, now 60, has not worked since the day of the shooting. She still shakes and limps as a result of the mental and physical exertion of what happened. Panic attacks can be triggered by a siren or when washing her hands.\n\nShe lives alone and spends her time praying and reading. She also paints, which can help calm the shaking in her hand when she focuses intently on the brush. She sells some of her work to pay bills.\n\nPaintings she has made of sunflowers hang on the wall in her living room, but she would leave Uvalde if she could afford to.\n\n\u201cIf I want to heal, I\u2019m not going to do it here,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a different person. But she died that day. I see my pictures from before. That\u2019s not me anymore.\u201d\n\nFor now, she still feels the need to show people what she did.\n\n\u201cI want the whole world to see that I did not run straight to my room to hide. I was warning everybody that there was a shooter on campus,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not stand around like all those 376 officers did. I was warning everybody to get in their rooms.\u201d\n\nAlthough CNN and other media organizations obtained copies of the surveillance video three years ago, there has still been no public release of the unedited footage. The city and county of Uvalde and the school district have published \u2014 or at least promised to publish \u2014 public records but the Texas DPS is still fighting to keep materials secret. That includes the surveillance video taken from Robb Elementary soon after the massacre, which the school district says is the only copy.\n\nDPS told CNN it had no plans to release the video. \u201cThe video you reference was collected as evidence in a criminal investigation and is currently held as evidence in a pending criminal prosecution,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nMore than three years later, Marin-Franco got one thing she had needed \u2014 an apology from her former employers. She said she had never been contacted by anyone from the school district, from the forwarded pleas when she was in the hospital, right up to a school board meeting late last month.\n\nThere she berated the board members for failing to release the public records as they had promised.\n\n\u201cYou asked us to trust you, but how can we?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou say you stand for transparency, but you have withheld the very footage that will clear my name and show the courage and truth of what I did that day.\u201d\n\nAfter the district\u2019s lawyers admitted a mistake was made and there would be more information released \u2014 not including the video \u2014 board member JJ Suarez took time to address her, saying he had seen the footage through media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that video was there because you have been through so much, and that video, how it got out, I don\u2019t know, because we don\u2019t have that, our district doesn\u2019t have it, but it got out somewhere. It cleared you, Amy, it cleared you from any wrongdoing and anything that you were accused of.\u201d\n\nIn a subsequent meeting \u2014 and with new legal representation \u2014 the school board went further regarding its files that are being held by DPS, including the video.\n\n\u201cThe district has requested those records but those have not been provided,\u201d lawyer Philip Fraissinet explained.\n\n\u201cThe board would like to file a brief urging the court to release all records and recordings that were taken from the district and are in DPS\u2019s possession.\u201d\n\nThe hour was nearing midnight, but Marin-Franco was still there, hoping to witness one more step forward in her journey for truth."

Neither did Gregson Wagner.\n\nWood, an Oscar-nominated actress known for starring in classic films like \"West Side Story,\" \"Rebel Without a Cause\" and \"Miracle on 34th Street,\" drowned Nov. 29, 1981. At the time, she was on a yacht with Wagner, actor Christopher Walken and the boat\u2019s captain over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nAfter a night of drinking, Wood\u2019s body was found floating in the waters off Catalina Island. She was 43.\n\nMARISKA HARGITAY SHARES THE SURPRISING WAY SHE DISCOVERED HER BIOLOGICAL FATHER'S IDENTITY\n\nGregson Wagner, who was 11 at the time, remembered thinking to herself, \"If I don\u2019t deal with this, it will kill me, so I\u2019m going to deal with it.\"\n\nWagner, now 95, raised Gregson Wagner along with her sisters, Katie Wagner and Courtney Wagner. Gregson Wagner told People magazine that the patriarch is \"proud\" of her.\n\n\"He always told me that,\" the 54-year-old told the outlet. \"He told me this once when we were having some therapy together. He said, \u2018I never thought you would make it when your mom died,\u2019 because I was so close to her. And, so, he\u2019s always blown away that I am totally OK.\n\n\"It was hard for me to find my strength for a long time, but now I do feel it,\" said Gregson Wagner.\n\nOver the years, the actress has been determined to keep the late star\u2019s legacy alive. She wrote a memoir published in 2020, \"More Than Love,\" which was accompanied by an HBO documentary, \"Natalie Wood: What Remains Behind.\" She recently relaunched a fragrance line that pays tribute to her mother.\n\n\"Everything that happened was so public, but grief is so private,\" she said. \"The truth is I do feel better when I talk about my grief.\"\n\nWATCH: ROBERT WAGNER'S MOST MEMORABLE ROLES, FROM \u2018HART TO HART\u2019 TO \u2018AUSTIN POWERS\u2019\n\nThe outlet noted that Gregson Wagner has remained close to Wagner. He remarried her mother in 1972 when Gregson Wagner was a toddler. Wood and Wagner first married in 1957 and divorced in 1962.\n\n\"I have had a great life, but I was so broken at that moment,\" said Gregson Wagner. \"So, I think he feels like if he dies tomorrow, he knows I'm going to be OK, but I'll miss him a lot.\n\n\"I think that grief is a lifetime of work, but the fragrance is just one little beautiful area of my life that is about beauty and something positive,\" she shared. \"Like alchemy, turning metal into gold. I turned my sadness and pain into beauty.\"\n\nFor decades, Wagner faced accusations that he was involved in Wood\u2019s death. In 2020, Gregson Wagner told Fox News Digital the patriarch didn\u2019t think twice about participating in her documentary to set the record straight.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t have to convince him at all,\" she explained at the time. \"I told him that [filmmaker] Laurent Bouzereau and I were going to make this documentary. \u2026 I told him we wanted him to be in it, and he said, \u2018Of course.\u2019 I think my dad really loved Laurent and really connected with him. I think he felt very safe in his hands and safe with me. He could share his memories and tell his side of the story on his own terms, which is the way he wanted to do it.\"\n\nGregson Wagner believed her father was courageous in revisiting bittersweet memories of Wood. The family is adamant that Wagner, who was described as being determined to give them a loving upbringing, wouldn\u2019t have harmed their mother in any way. They maintain what occurred that night was a tragic accident.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\n\"I am always blown away by his courage,\" she said. \"As my dad and knowing him for basically my whole life, I know him to be such a courageous person.

                "text": "Hundreds of bodies could have been buried at a mass grave discovered in Egypt\u2019s Sinai province by human rights campaigners.\n\nBodies lying on the surface and others buried barely 30cm below were found at a burial site near a military outpost by the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights.\n\nThe group discovered the mass graves while conducting research into disappearances and extrajudicial killings of civilians during a decade of conflict in the Sinai region between Egyptian security forces and Islamic State-aligned militants.\n\nThe findings, exclusively shared with the Guardian, provide \u201crare, documented evidence of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions in North Sinai\u201d, said Ahmed Salem, the executive director of SFHR.\n\n\u201cThis discovery not only sheds light on the scale of violations committed by the Egyptian army during the conflict, but also demonstrates a systematic pattern of unlawful killings and the secret burial of victims, carried out with total impunity.\u201d\n\nThe Egyptian state denies having carried out forced displacement in Sinai but is accused of having displaced more than 150,000 indigenous residents and has never acknowledged any civilian casualties in Sinai during its war against IS.\n\nIn a new report, SFHR identified the site of a mass grave south of the city of al-Arish, in an area with visible signs of a heavy military presence, including several bases and large sand trenches.\n\nThe grave was only 350 metres from a road but was concealed by the military presence in an area that was heavily locked down during the peak periods of conflict between 2013 and 2022.\n\nSFHR said two members of pro-military militias had given basic information about the mass graves sites but their own researchers had then had to search for the sites themselves.\n\nWhen they visited, on two occasions in December 2023 and January 2024, they discovered two pits, one of which they could not access because of its proximity to military forces but which they said had the remains of bodies visible from the surface.\n\nVideos shared by SFHR show that when they arrived at the site the remains of bodies were apparent without having to dig, having possibly been dislodged from their graves by flooding in the past. Other bodies were found when they dug further, to a depth of 30cm.\n\nResearch conducted by Forensic Architecture, a research agency based at Goldsmiths, University of London, using satellite analysis and images shared by SFHR from the site, confirmed that a minimum of 36 skulls could be identified. SFHR\u2019s researchers believe there are more than 300 bodies at the site based on their own counts but said they could not take pictures of all of them because of time constraints.\n\nForensic Architecture confirmed that the site was probably used as a mass grave by identifying the clearing of the land and the emergence of track marks over a period of time.\n\n\u201cThere were so many bodies visible, I couldn\u2019t imagine I would see something like that. These were people who might have once walked beside me on the streets and now here were there skeletons,\u201d said a member of SFHR\u2019s team, whose identity has been concealed for fear of reprisals. \u201cThe scene was horrific. We all froze from that first moment we stepped into the pit and saw so many corpses superficially buried there.\u201d\n\nThey said the bodies were buried in an undignified manner, without respect for local customs. They found many bodies were probably in the clothing they were wearing when they were killed. Some were blindfolded. They said there were no signs of military uniforms or equipment in the graves.\n\nSFHR\u2019s first informant told them that the bodies buried in the mass graves belonged both to people killed shortly after detention and those who had been detained for several years. They were not necessarily militants but were suspected of collaborating with them; however, they had been executed without any legal process or substantial evidence.\n\nAnother source confirmed the site south of al-Arish city and said he had witnessed an execution of 15 people there, after which soldiers had placed weapons next to their bodies and the next day claimed in a statement that they had killed 15 terrorists in a clash.\n\nThe wife of a man who was arrested during a mass raid in 2016 alongside his father and brothers said that nine years later the family are still trying to find information about their relatives but are constantly told by security forces to give up.\n\n\u201cWe have lived in fear. Nine years is a long time and we have lived without any news. I was scared to ever look through the statements of the military spokesperson, to see their names and pictures among those \u2018liquidated\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nThe woman said the family were ordinary civilians. Her mother-in-law would go to meet recently released prisoners and ask about their family, but found no information.\n\nShe said the family has struggled since most of the men in the family were arrested and others fled Sinai for fear of the same happening to them. The women fend for themselves by baking bread and selling it locally.\n\nShe also has a young son, who she was pregnant with at the time of her husband\u2019s arrest, and has been looking after the daughter of one of the brothers whose wife had died prior to his arrest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see my son grow up knowing nothing of his his father other than a picture,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. Not a single night of these past nine years have I slept without tears running down my cheeks.\u201d"

                "text": "History becomes legend. Legend becomes myth.\n\nAt best, historians hope that at least a kernel of truth lingers lost among centuries\u2019 worth of embellishment, propaganda, and hype.\n\nBut the gap between fantasy and reality has narrowed dramatically when it comes to what we know of China\u2019s tyrannical first emperor, Qin Shi Huang.\n\nEvidence is mounting that a 15-ton casket pulled from the outskirts of his fabled tomb last year belongs to his noble, yet tragic, son Prince Gao.\n\nAnd new clues are strengthening the likelihood that the emperor\u2019s famous mausoleum really did house an enormous, realistic model of the vast empire he had conquered.\n\nQuicksilver strands\n\nChina\u2019s most famous historian, Sima Qian, lived from 145BC to 86BC.\n\nEmperor Qin died in 210BC. So well over a century had passed by the time Sima penned his epic \u201cShiji \u2013 the Records of the Grand Historian.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s plenty of time for political spin and fanfiction to have taken their toll.\n\nHis story certainly sounded fanciful.\n\nEmperor Qin had spent much of his reign searching for the secret of eternal life. But every alchemist, explorer, magician and priest he tasked with the job failed.\n\nLuckily, the first thing he had done when taking the throne at age 13 was order the construction of an immense mausoleum.\n\nSima wrote that 700,000 workers had laboured 38 years to complete the funerary complex at Mount Li in Shanxi province, north-central China.\n\n\u201cReplicas of palaces, scenic towers, and the hundred officials, as well as rare utensils and wonderful objects, were brought to fill up the tomb,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cMercury was used to fashion imitations of the hundred rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze, and the seas, constructed in such a way that they seemed to flow. Above were representations of all the heavenly bodies, below, the features of the earth.\u201d\n\nThe first modern evidence that some of this may be true came in 1974.\n\nFarmers digging a well stumbled on the pottery statue of a soldier. Archaeologists soon found an entire terracotta army, exact in every minor detail.\n\n\u201cAs further excavation revealed the extent of the emperor\u2019s mausoleum, with offices, stables and halls, along with clay figures of officials, acrobats and labourers and life-size bronze animals, it became clear that the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian, writing in second century BC, hadn\u2019t been exaggerating after all,\u201d writes the Royal Society of Chemistry\u2019s Philip Ball.\n\nBut what interests chemists and archaeologists alike is mercury.\n\nMercury (Shui yin) translates as \u201cwater silver\u201d in Chinese.\n\nToxic truth\n\nEmperor Qian\u2019s central mausoleum has been surveyed, but not excavated.\n\nIt\u2019s some 1,640 square feet. And at its heart is an 262 ft by 164 ft chamber.\n\nAt that scale, the mythical map would have to be enormous.\n\nBut soil samples taken in the 1980s revealed unnaturally high levels of mercury. More recent gravity-mapping and electrical resistivity tests have been more conclusive.\n\n\u201cMeasurements of soil resistivity have revealed another intriguing feature,\u201d writes Ball. \u201cThey show a so-called phase anomaly, which is produced when an electrical current is reflected from a conducting surface, such as a metal. Could this be a sign of mercury?\u201d\n\nSome Chinese archaeologists believe these reflections roughly correlate with the positions of China\u2019s major river systems. Others aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nWhat is sure, now, is that the production of mercury was in full force at the time of Emperor Qian.\n\nChinese state-controlled media reports the chemical makeup of mercury recovered from the mausoleum matches that found in the cinnabar mines of Xunyang, 75 miles away. Once used as a pigment and traditional medicine, smelting this mineral would release the mercury bound within it.\n\nNew surveys of Xunyang have found three ancient mining sites that produced the mineral along the Shengjia River valley. All three contain artefacts dating from the Neolithic era to the Qing Dynasty.\n\nThe Global Times reports up to 100 tons of mercury has been detected in the mausoleum.\n\n\u201cMercury has excellent insulation properties, forming a sealed thermal barrier within the tomb, while also having antibacterial effects,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cTherefore, scientists widely surmise that the mercury in the tomb was used for preservation and antitheft purposes.\u201d\n\nResearchers have also long suspected the importance of cinnabar.\n\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post\u2019s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here!\n\n\u201cChinese legend tells of one Huang An, who prolonged his life for at least 10,000 years by eating mercury sulphide (the mineral cinnabar),\u201d writes Ball.\n\n\u201cThe First Emperor was said to have consumed wine and honey laden with cinnabar, thinking it would prolong his life\u201d.\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nLike Emperor Qian\u2019s mausoleum, Chinese archaeologists have been nervous about picking apart the burial casket excavated last year.\n\nWork continues, slowly.\n\nThe 15-ton casket appears untouched by grave robbers.\n\nTherefore, like the tomb of the Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamun, it\u2019s likely to offer an immense insight into royal life in that era.\n\nIts casing has largely collapsed. However, this has revealed approximately 6000 bronze coins, as well as jade, silver, and gold figurines. A complete set of cutlery and porcelain crockery has been recovered, as have pieces of armour and weapons.\n\nInitially, its owner was assumed to have been a \u201cnotable warrior\u201d.\n\nNow speculation is centring on one of the First Emperor\u2019s many sons.\n\nEmperor Qian\u2019s first son, Fusu, was supposed to inherit the throne. But royal court machinations eventually whittled their way through the succession until Prince Hu Hai rose to the top.\n\nPrince Gao knew he was doomed. So he resolved to publicly confront his younger brother to demand an honourable death and the right to be buried with his famous father.\n\nOr so the story goes.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in 2000 years \u2026 we have a chance to figure out if what Sima Qian wrote is correct,\u201d says Oxford University associate professor Hui Ming Tak Ted.\n\nSo far, the evidence is circumstantial.\n\nPart of the skull has been recovered. Testing shows it to belong to a healthy male, aged between 18 and 22 years old.\n\nAnd the youngest objects identified so far belong to the late Qin period \u2013 meaning they fit the timeline of the emperor\u2019s death.\n\nBut a royal signet or personal seal would have to be recovered before the burial\u2019s identity is confirmed."

He wants to make sure that we\u2019re able to stay in our homes.\u201d\n\nMamdani, virtually unknown to most New Yorkers when he entered the June Democratic primary, beat Andrew Cuomo even as he lost in majority-Black neighborhoods across the city. His campaign has long been accused of relying on younger, wealthier residents who are pricing out longstanding residents \u2013 a critique summarized by an adviser to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries who referred to Mamdani\u2019s backers as \u201cTeam Gentrification.\u201d\n\nAhead of a November election where he will face Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams as independents, Mamdani is working to make inroads with Black voters by emphasizing his commitment to homeownership and lowering costs for people trying to stay in neighborhoods that are getting more expensive.\n\nThere is still some skepticism of Mamdani\u2019s credentials and his proposals, giving an opening to Adams, the second Black mayor in the city\u2019s history, and Cuomo, who has long counted on Black voters in his runs for governor.

Yvette Clarke, State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Brooklyn Democratic Party Chair Rodneyse Bichotte.\n\nSharpton, founder of the National Action Network, said he was impressed with Mamdani but hadn\u2019t decided on whom to endorse.\n\nRev. Malcolm Byrd, pastor of Mother AME Zion Church in Harlem, which has hosted Mamdani at their Sunday service, said he has watched for years as his congregation changes rapidly.\n\n\u201cThere is a constant cycling of new people and in Black communities, the Black church is the one place where if you unite your messaging, you can get a message across to Black America,\u201d Byrd told CNN.\n\nDonovan Richards, the Queens borough president, previously represented parts of southeast Queens that are home to a large middle-class Black community where many residents own their homes. Mamdani lost the area in the primary, but not by large margins. Now, as Mamdani adjusts his message to include a focus on homeowners, Richards says Mamdani is reaching out to older communities with the help of established Black leaders like him who have endorsed him.\n\nSome of the city\u2019s Black leaders including Richards have cautioned Mamdani that his rent freeze proposal for rent-stabilized apartments may alienate some Black voters, including some small landlords who rely on rental income.\n\nMamdani has responded by highlighting his campaign proposal to tackle the city\u2019s onerous property tax system. The notoriously complex system has gone without reform for decades, resulting in an antiquated structure that taxes homeowners in more affluent neighborhoods at much lower rates than those in poorer areas. Mamdani has also said he would end a city policy to sell tax liens when homeowners fall behind on their property taxes. The policy has been found to disproportionally affect Black and brown homeowners, resulting in the loss of their homes to foreclosure.\n\nWhile Byrd also hasn\u2019t endorsed a candidate, he said Mamdani had \u201cwon a lot of people over\u201d the Sunday he addressed the congregation and warned against candidates who assume that if the Black churches have with them before, they will be with them again.\n\nMamdani is a constant on the Sunday church circuit, visiting over a dozen churches in the last month, he has gathered with young black entrepreneurs, visited small businesses in Brooklyn\u2019s Little Caribbean neighborhood and recently made an appearance at the West Indian Day Parade \u2013 a political right of passage for all political candidates where lack of rhythm could temporarily make or break support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said that a good leader is a good listener, so before you ask me to wine, I need to see a good example,\u201d Mamdani told a crowd of parade revelers referencing the Jamaican dance. The crowd obliged and Mamdani followed, swinging his hips from side to side encouraging the crowd to join in the dance.\n\nDuring a recent meeting with young Black and Latino entrepreneurs in the Bronx Mamdani listened as the crowd discussed access to capital, education, business investments and the cost of living.\n\nSome of the entrepreneurs were wary of his ties to democratic socialism and worry that their chance to make money in a system that has historically disadvantaged them could slip away.\n\nFor years, progressives have struggled to gain traction with older and more moderate Black voters, even as they\u2019ve been able to appeal to a diverse base of young people. That dynamic was on display during the 2016 and 2020 presidential primaries, in which Black voters in South Carolina rejected independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in favor of the party\u2019s eventual nominees, Hillary Clinton and President Joe Biden.\n\nAntjuan Seawright, a South Carolina-based Democratic strategist who advises Reps. Jim Clyburn and Hakeem Jeffries, said progressives still have work to do.\n\n\u201cWhat no voter wants, in particular Black voters, is someone showing up telling you what\u2019s good for you, instead of listening to what your needs, concerns, fears, hopes and aspirations are.\u201d\n\nA former backer of Cuomo and Adams, Shirley Fearon, 80, said she first met Mamdani during a community barbecue after her youngest daughter and grandchildren had mentioned him in their conversations. Slowly she came around, concluding that the other two candidates in the race \u201cwere tainted,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFor sure, they\u2019re a little suspicious,\u201d Fearon said of neighbors and friends in church who have told her they\u2019re still not sure whether they will vote for Mamdani. \u201cThe older folks, we sort of go with what we know.\u201d"

Despite substantial financial efforts to undermine his campaign, including support for rival candidates like Andrew Cuomo, Mamdani continues to lead in polls, reflecting a strong voter desire for change in housing policies. As the election approaches, the billionaire class's attempts to thwart his candidacy appear increasingly ineffective, with Mamdani gaining widespread grassroots support.",
                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "Zohran Mamdani has had to overcome a lot during his campaign to be New York City\u2019s next mayor.\n\nHis age, relative lack of experience and his self-stated democratic socialism could have held him back. Yet the 33-year-old, a relative unknown 12 months ago, sailed through all challenges as he became the favorite to win the election in November.\n\nOne thing still looms over Mamdani, however: New York City\u2019s billionaire class, and the not-unrelated real estate lobby.\n\nMamdani has terrified some traditional big-money Democratic donors and powerful real-estate tycoons by promising to freeze rent prices and raise taxes \u2013 slightly \u2013 on the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers.\n\nSuch promises prompted elites to spend millions during the Democratic primary, which didn\u2019t work. Mamdani coasted past Andrew Cuomo, the former New York governor \u2013 but the rich aren\u2019t done yet.\n\nSome of New York\u2019s wealthiest landlords and business people gathered with Cuomo this month to \u201cplot his path to City Hall\u201d, with the city\u2019s biggest developer warning that they must unite to stop Mamdani, according to the New York Times.\n\nAmong the plotters were at least two billionaires and one of New York\u2019s biggest building developers. Days after that meeting, Bill Ackman, a hedge fund manager and some-time activist who has a net worth of nearly $10bn, also weighed in.\n\nAckman, who has donated to Democrats, but supported Donald Trump in 2024, called for Eric Adams, the incumbent mayor who, like Cuomo, is running as an independent candidate, to drop out of the race to clear the path for the former governor.\n\nEarlier, Ackman had claimed, as have other wealthy New Yorkers, that Mamdani\u2019s proposal to place an additional 2% tax on New Yorkers earning more than $1m would cause rich people to flee the city. He pledged to invest huge amounts in blocking Mamdani, who more than 570,000 people voted for (including ranked choice voters) in the Democratic primary.\n\n\u201cThere are hundreds of million[s] of dollars of capital available to back a competitor to Mamdani that can be put together overnight,\u201d Ackman said in June \u2013 adding that he is \u201cin the text strings and the WhatsApp groups\u201d.\n\nIt was Cuomo who attracted the big money during the primary. An analysis by In These Times found that real estate donors spent $6m trying to get Cuomo elected. The New York Times reported that $250,000 alone came from the head of a Boston-based construction company planning to expand into New York.\n\nMichael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor, spent $8.3m supporting Cuomo over the summer, and the money is continuing to pour in: less than two weeks ago Ron Lauder, a billionaire Republican donor, gave $750,000 to a super Pac backing Cuomo, in August John B Hess, head of the Hess Corporation, gave his second $500,000 donation, the investigative outlet Sludge reported.\n\n\u201cSince the primary they\u2019ve been panicking and scrambling, trying to figure out how they can defeat Mamdani to keep their bottom line,\u201d said Sumathy Kumar, managing director of the NYS Tenant Bloc, an affordable housing advocacy group.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been holding emergency meetings trying to cohere around Cuomo. In the primary they dropped millions of dollars into the Cuomo-aligned super Pac \u2013 they\u2019ve been trying everything they can, throwing money, and it doesn\u2019t seem to be working.\u201d\n\nThat much is clear, given Mamdani continues to hold a commanding lead over Cuomo. This week, a Marist poll found him winning 45% of the vote; Cuomo had 24%, the Republican Curtis Sliwa, 17% and the embattled Adams was at just 9%.\n\nIt\u2019s polling that reflects the urgency Cuomo-backers are feeling. In recent weeks, there have been repeated calls for Sliwa and Adams to drop out of the race to consolidate anti-Mamdani donors and voters, with Trump also reportedly weighing in \u2013 there have even been reports the president\u2019s advisers had discussed offering a job to Adams if he steps down.\n\nEven if that happens, however, there\u2019s little hard evidence that Cuomo would win. The Marist poll asked New Yorkers how they would vote in a hypothetical match-up between just Mamdani and Cuomo: in that scenario 49% went for Mamdani compared with 39% for his opponent, suggesting the billionaire class\u2019s efforts may be in vain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not working,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cThey\u2019ve spent millions of dollars warning New Yorkers against a Zohran Mamdani win, and it didn\u2019t work, because tenants want a rent freeze, they want to be able to stay in New York City.\u201d\n\nWith early voting in the election starting in just over a month \u2013 election day is Tuesday, 4 November \u2013 the richest New Yorkers may be finding out the hard way that money can\u2019t buy you everything.\n\n\u201cMany power brokers and billionaires are frustrated, and scared, because their demands are not the center piece of Zohran\u2019s agenda and they find themselves outside of \u2018the room where it happens\u2019,\u201d said Ana Mar\u00eda Archila, co-state director for New York Working Families party, a progressive political party which backs Democratic candidates who align with its platform.\n\n\u201cZohran has tapped into a broadly shared sentiment that something has to change, and now. He is proposing concrete solutions and that is why so many people are enthusiastically supporting his campaign.\u201d"

(And expect cops in Mamdani\u2019s NYPD to be under orders against it.)\n\nThat doesn\u2019t technically count as full-on legalization, plead his mouthpieces \u2014 but has the same result: \u201cSex workers\u201d able to freely ply their trade wherever they choose \u2014 or, more to the point, wherever their pimps demand.\n\nBecause prostitution absolutely is not just an unusual career path, as progressives insist: While a bare handful of \u201cpros\u201d might sincerely choose to sell their bodies for a living, it\u2019s a tremendously unnatural and appalling route for nearly all women.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of prostitutes are seduced, coerced or outright trafficked into the flesh trade, an inherently dehumanizing business that brings blight into every area where it flourishes.\n\nAnyone who doubts that can just take a stroll along the \u201cMarket of Sweethearts\u201d on Roosevelt Avenue in Queens.\n\n(And if you doubt that progressives see no problem with public prostitution, consider the clean-up-Roosevelt-Ave prescription from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mamdani\u2019s fellow Democratic Socialist: more trash cans.)\n\nAgain, for all his soft-pedaling in these final weeks of the mayoral race, Mamdani has been four-square for decriminalization from his first race in office in 2020, right along with ending all cash bail, complete drug decriminalization, massively defunding the NYPD and closing Rikers without building replacement jails.\n\nSitting on a fat lead in the polls, he\u2019s hoping to keep voters in the dark, and avoiding questions as best he can.\n\nHence his dubious dodge of a WABC town hall, supposedly in protest of the network\u2019s (now lapsed!) suspension of Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nMamdani wants voters distracted by all the wonderful things he\u2019s promised, when in fact, cheaper hookers may be the only part of his \u201caffordability\u201d agenda that he can actually deliver on."

The page is still viewable via an online archive. Fox News Digital has asked WFG multiple times why the page was deleted but has not gotten a response.\n\nMeanwhile, Batie-Smoose previously told Fox News Digital what she recalled during the Oct. 3 game against Colorado State in which Fleming was accused of conspiring with opposing player Malaya Jones to have Slusser spiked in the face.\n\n\"Close to the end of that set was when [Fleming] overpassed a serve right on top of the net for Malayla to hit toward Brooke Slusser, and then those two were kind of always doing eye contact and making smirks up to that point.

Nearly 60% of these participants lost 10% of their body weight, while 39.6% lost at least 15%.\n\nOf the 1,127 participants who had pre-diabetes at the start of the study, up to 91% achieved nearly normal blood sugar levels compared to the 42% taking a placebo, the researchers found.\n\nOrforglipron showed \"clinically meaningful improvements\" in cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity, like non-HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and triglycerides.\n\nPOPULAR WEIGHT-LOSS MEDICATION COULD RELIEVE PAINFUL ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS, DOCTORS REPORT\n\nThe highest dose also reduced a marker for inflammation, called high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, by 47.7%.\n\nThe study found the drug\u2019s safety profile to be consistent with the existing GLP-1 medications. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal, including nausea, constipation, diarrhea and vomiting, at mild to moderate severity.\n\nSean Wharton, M.D., director at Wharton Medical Clinic and the lead study author in Canada, wrote in a statement that obesity is a \"complex, global health challenge\" requiring treatment options that are \"effective and easy to integrate into everyday life.\"\n\n'NEXT OZEMPIC' AIMS TO DELIVER 30% WEIGHT LOSS WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS\n\n\"In this phase 3 study, orforglipron demonstrated strong efficacy results and safety consistent with the GLP-1 class, reinforcing its potential as a first-line treatment in primary care,\" he said in the press release.\n\n\"Orforglipron could help reduce known markers of cardiovascular risk associated with obesity and support meaningful improvements in public health.\"\n\nLilly announced it is moving forward with plans to get approval for orforglipron as an obesity drug.

And, for many people, the steep price tag isn\u2019t the only barrier.\n\nGLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy typically require a doctor\u2019s evaluation and a prescription, as well as frequent pick-ups from the pharmacy. It\u2019s a process that can be time-consuming and expensive. But, with the right program, it doesn\u2019t have to be.\n\nMyStart is one of the leading telehealth platforms aiming to transform how weight-loss medications are prescribed, with an ambitious goal of making the process faster and more affordable.\n\nGetting started is simple. New users begin with a short health intake quiz, providing some basic information on their health and goals. Depending on the individual\u2019s needs, follow-up bloodwork and video consultations may be required.\n\nIn many cases, MyStart can approve a prescription within 24 hours, with medication arriving at the patient\u2019s front door in as little as 48 hours.\n\nThe program starts at $299/month, but the cost covers more than injections. Patients receive access to U.S. board-certified clinicians nationwide, expedited FedEx shipping, personalized dosage adjustments and ongoing support from a dedicated patient care coordination team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re passing our efficiencies back to our patients,\u201d MyStart CEO Matthew Stern explained. \u201cThe more we scale, the more affordable this becomes. Our goal is long-term health, not just short-term results.\u201d\n\nAffordability isn\u2019t just about competitive pricing; it\u2019s about cost transparency and consistency. At MyStart, the initial price for medication and ongoing care will never increase from a user\u2019s original plan, even if their dosage changes over time.\n\nThe company\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ritu Chopra, has also highlighted that MyStart is there to support patients every step of the way, not just when they need a prescription.\n\n\u201cWe built MyStart to take the confusion out of GLP-1 care,\u201d says Dr. Ritu Chopra, Chief Medical Officer. \u201cWe\u2019ve designed a complete protocol, not just a prescription, and we\u2019re proud to offer under-24-hour turnaround on consultations and 48-hour delivery.\u201d\n\nUnlike some traditional providers, they offer a structured 90-day program that includes comprehensive medical oversight. Users can connect with MyStart clinicians as often as needed to discuss side effects, track progress, or adjust dosage.\n\nOn average, users lose 22 pounds within their first six months with MyStart. Aside from supporting their weight loss goals, many reviewers have credited the program for bringing back their confidence and \u201cchanging their lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had tried every diet out there and was about to give up,\u201d one pleased reviewer said. \u201cMyStart helped me get on GLP-1, and just four months later, I\u2019m in love with my new body!\u201d\n\nEven with its revolutionary impact in the weight-loss space, this is just the beginning for MyStart. The company has also expanded its services to include women\u2019s hormone health, metabolic longevity, and personalized wellness, providing patients\u2019 a full spectrum of care to take charge of their health.\n\nMyStart is redefining what modern care looks like in a space where access to effective weight-loss treatments is often blocked by high costs and complex processes.

Super Typhoon Ragasa is the strongest storm of 2025 and is now bearing down on China's southern coast.\n\nIt is due to make landfall in Guangdong province on Wednesday, where some 370,000 people have been evacuated, and many schools and businesses shut. Hong Kong has upgraded its typhoon warning to level 10, the maximum level.\n\nRagasa - equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane - packed wind gusts of up to 285km/h (177mph) at its highest point on Monday, and has triggered warnings of floods, storm surges and landslides across the region this week.\n\nTaiwan has been lashed by the outside edge of Ragasa since Monday. The island recorded almost 60cm (24 inches) of rain in its east due to the typhoon, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nIn Hualien county the burst lake washed away a bridge, uprooted trees and submerged cars. Video showed fast-moving water flowing through the area.\n\n\"In some places, water temporarily rose as high as the second floor of a house and was about [as high as] one floor in the town centre, where the water has been receding,\" Lee Lung-sheng, deputy chief of Hualien County Fire Department, told AFP news agency.\n\n\"About 263 people were trapped and moved up to higher ground when the river suddenly rose. They are not in immediate danger, but they are very worried about the high water.\"\n\nElsewhere in Taiwan six people were injured, ferry services suspended and more than 100 international flights cancelled as Ragasa passed through.\n\nChinese authorities are warning of storm surges of up to five metres. Some 370,000 people have been evacuated so far in Guangdong, as authorities warn of a \"catastrophic\" situation.\n\nOn Tuesday, supermarket shelves in Hong Kong were wiped empty of fresh bread, vegetables, meat and instant noodles as residents prepared to hunker down.\n\nHong Kong International Airport said it expected \"significant disruption to flight operations\" from 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Tuesday until the next day.\n\nMore than 500 Cathay Pacific flights are expected to be cancelled, while Hong Kong Airlines said it would stop all departures from the city.\n\nRagasa has been dubbed the \"King of Storms\" by China's meteorological agency and is expected to move towards northern Vietnam in the coming days, potentially affecting millions.\n\nIn cities across southern China, shop owners piled sandbags in front of their stores in preparation for the storm's arrival, with residents in low-lying areas next to the sea front particularly worried about tidal surges.\n\nMany have also taped up the windows of their homes and businesses, hoping to prevent their destruction.\n\n'Dirty side' of Ragasa menaces Hong Kong\n\nAlthough this part of southern China and Hong Kong is used to frequent typhoons, the impact this time may be worsened because of the location of the storm.\n\nThe right hand side of Ragasa - as it approaches Hong Kong and Guangdong - is know as the \"dirty side\" - and it is this which will hit the region. The \"dirty side\" can be much more destructive than the left-hand side, primarily because the motion of the storm is added to the background circulation of the typhoon.\n\nWhere these two movements combine is where the most destructive winds are found. Additionally, these winds will be pushing water inland, resulting in a bigger storm surge.\n\nIt is not yet clear exactly how much climate change has affected Ragasa specifically. But a warming world is expected to make tropical storms like typhoons and hurricanes more intense on average, according to UN scientists.\n\nThat means higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall and a higher risk of coastal flooding, although the number of typhoons across east and southeast Asia may decrease in future."

Hong Kong-based airline Cathay Pacific said it would stop passenger flights scheduled to leave and arrive in the city on Tuesday evening until Thursday morning.

                "text": "The bursting of a barrier lake in Taiwan has killed at least 14 people and left 124 people missing, officials have announced, after Super Typhoon Ragasa pounded the island with torrential rains and brought widespread damage to parts of east Asia.\n\nThe outer rim of Super Typhoon Ragasa has been bearing down on Taiwan since Monday as its path moves down towards the southern Chinese coast.\n\nThe barrier lake, formed by landslides triggered by earlier heavy rain in Taiwan\u2019s east, burst its banks mid-afternoon on Tuesday, unleashing a wall of water into the Guangfu township.\n\n\u201cAs of 7 am [Wednesday], 14 people are confirmed dead and 18 were reported injured,\u201d said Lee Kuan-ting, a Hualien county government press official.\n\n\u201cThirty missing was the figure last night, released by the National Fire Agency, and our teams are still searching,\u201d he added.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s fire department said on Wednesday that 124 people remained missing in Hualien county.\n\nRagasa had already toppled trees, torn the roofs off buildings and killed at least two people while ripping through the northern Philippines, where thousands sought shelter in schools and evacuation centres.\n\nHong Kong and parts of southern China were on high alert on Wednesday as Ragasa approached with powerful winds and rains, forcing Chinese authorities to shut down schools and businesses in at least 10 cities.\n\nIn Hong Kong, classes were to be suspended on Tuesday and Wednesday, though the stock exchange adopted new rules this year to keep markets open during typhoons.\n\nThere were no flights out of Hong Kong after 6pm Tuesday, according to the airport\u2019s website. Cathay Pacific earlier said that more than 500 of its flights were set to be cancelled.\n\nThe super typhoon was generating maximum sustained winds of 195km/h near its centre while moving west across the South China Sea, according to Hong Kong\u2019s weather service.\n\nThe Hong Kong Observatory issued its highest typhoon warning, T10, at 2.40am on Wednesday, saying it will \u201cremain in force for some time\u201d as Ragasa comes closest to the territory later in the morning.\n\nIt also warned of significant swells and storm surge as the storm moves through, with some areas potentially seeing water levels four to five metres above normal.\n\nAn AFP reporter saw waves nearly five metres high smash into the seaside promenade of Hong Kong\u2019s Heng Fa Chuen residential district around nightfall.\n\nTerence Choi, a Hong Kong resident, said he had stocked two days\u2019 worth of food at home, adding that he was \u201cquite nervous\u201d about the prospect of the housing estate losing power and fresh water supply.\n\nYang Lee-o, who has lived in the coastal neighbourhood of Lei Yue Mun for 40 years, said government workers had already spent a day placing sandbags.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s number-two official, Eric Chan, previously said Ragasa would pose a \u201cserious threat\u201d comparable to the super typhoons of 2017 and 2018, which cost hundreds of millions in property damage.\n\nScientists warn that storms are becoming more powerful as the world warms due to the effects of climate change.\n\nRagasa \u2013 named after the Filipino word for rapid motion \u2013 is expected to make landfall in the central and western coastal areas of Guangdong within 24 hours, the province\u2019s emergency management bureau said on Tuesday morning.\n\nShenzhen in China\u2019s south-east earlier ordered the evacuation of 400,000 people.\n\nEmergency management authorities in the Chinese tech hub said that except for emergency rescue personnel and those ensuring people\u2019s livelihood, \u201cdo not go out casually\u201d.\n\nOther cities in the southern province of Guangdong that are implementing the measures include Chaozhou, Zhuhai, Dongguan and Foshan.\n\nWith Reuters"

                "text": "In the spring of 2012, David Cameron was prime minister and British troops were still fighting in Afghanistan under the stewardship of the then defence secretary, Philip Hammond.\n\nBefore deploying, soldiers from the UK would be flown 3,000 miles south-west of Helmand province, to Kenya, for hot weather training. They would train at Batuk, the British army base that still operates today, close to Nanyuki, a poor market town in the east of the country.\n\nIn a town that struggles with poverty, unemployment and limited economic opportunities, many women in Nanyuki would turn to selling sex for money \u2013 British soldiers being a lucrative source of trade.\n\nAgnes Wanjiru, a 21-year-old hairdresser and mother to a five-month-old baby, was among them. On the night she disappeared, in late March 2012, she was last seen in the bar of the Lion\u2019s Court hotel, a popular haunt with British soldiers, where she had been drinking with two friends, Florence Nyaguthii and Susan Nyambura.\n\nThe next morning, when Agnes failed to return home, her family and friends began looking for her. They spent weeks searching, until, about two months later, Agnes\u2019s body was found in a septic tank in the grounds of the hotel.\n\nIn the years since then, her disappearance has been the subject of a number of criminal investigations and inquests, Agnes\u2019s family campaigning to get answers while caring for Stacey, the daughter she left behind.\n\nOver the course of 13 and a half years, the campaign was spearheaded by her niece Esther Njoki and sister Rose Wanyua Wanjiku, who saw power pass between six prime ministers and seven defence secretaries in the UK, and three presidents in Kenya, before they saw any progress.\n\nTheir campaign was cast into the international spotlight, and was given added momentum, when the Sunday Times, almost four years ago to the day, began reporting on Agnes\u2019s case.\n\nServing and former soldiers who were in Kenya at the time Agnes disappeared spoke out, with several coming forward to name a suspect in the case.\n\nIt put renewed pressure on the governments of both countries, amid anger and protests in Kenya over Britain\u2019s continued military presence in the region. Separately, the renewed interest in the case also resulted in a fresh police investigation, led by Kenyan detectives, with the support of the UK\u2019s royal military police.\n\nWith jurisdiction in the case resting with Kenya, detectives flew out from Nairobi to the UK to question suspects and witnesses, many of them British soldiers.\n\nAfter almost a decade and a half with no arrests, no court appearances, and no convictions, it seemed unlikely that there would ever be a breakthrough in the case.\n\nYet on Tuesday, the high court in Nairobi issued an arrest warrant for Robert James Purkiss, a former British soldier, originally from Greater Manchester.\n\nIt is only an arrest warrant, with the charges set before the Kenyan court not proven. Purkiss would need to be extradited in order to face those charges.\n\nIt means the Kenyan government will first need to submit an extradition request to the UK Home Office, which will need to be certified by the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, and sent to the courts, with extradition cases normally heard at Westminster magistrates court.\n\nFor a suspect to be extradited, the court must be satisfied there are reasonable grounds for believing the conduct described is an extradition offence, and only then will a warrant be issued in the UK and a suspect arrested.\n\nA date would then be set for an extradition hearing in front of British judge, which Purkiss would have the opportunity to contest, before the separate criminal proceedings could take place in Kenya. The case is next due to be mentioned at court in Nairobi on 21 October.\n\nIf Purkiss is successfully extradited to face trial in Kenya, the criminal proceedings would look different to those in the UK; the jury system was abolished in Kenya at the end of colonial rule.\n\nSimilar to in a UK criminal case, a defendant has the opportunity to plead guilty or not guilty, and if a case goes to trial, the prosecution and defence will set out their respective cases, with the opportunity to cross-examine each other\u2019s witnesses.\n\nHowever, it is the presiding judge who makes a decision in a case, rather than a citizen jury, with legal expert assessors, who assist the judge in determining facts, used in some cases, particularly more serious trials.\n\nNeither the Home Office nor the Ministry of Defence has disclosed whether a request for extradition has yet been submitted by the Kenyan government.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru and we remain absolutely committed to helping them secure justice,\u201d a UK government spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe understand that the Kenyan director of public prosecutions has determined that a British national should face trial in relation to the murder of Ms Wanjiru in 2012.\n\n\u201cThis is subject to ongoing legal proceedings and we will not comment further at this stage.\u201d"

But the judge, who also controversially argued that the court lacked jurisdiction over the case, claimed there was no proof Bolsonaro was to blame for inciting the riots.\n\nFux did, however, vote to convict two of Bolsonaro\u2019s closest allies \u2013 his former defence minister, Gen Walter Braga Netto, and his former aide-de-camp, Lt Col Mauro Cid \u2013 for the crime of violently attempting to abolish Brazilian democracy. The judge concluded that the pair had helped plan and bankroll a plot to murder Moraes in order to generate social mayhem they hoped would trigger a military intervention.\n\nThere were leftwing celebrations outside the supreme court as Rocha sealed the fate of Bolsonaro and seven other close allies who were also convicted. They include the former defence ministers, Netto and Gen Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira de Oliveira, the former minister for institutional security, Gen Augusto Heleno, and the former navy commander, Adm Almir Garnier Santos.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s former spy chief, Alexandre Ramagem, and justice minister, Anderson Torres, were also found guilty, as was Cid.\n\n\u201cToday, Brazil is making history,\u201d Lindbergh Farias, the leader of Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party in the lower house of congress, said as he emerged from the building. \u201cBrazil is saying: \u2018Coups are a crime!\u2019\u201d\n\nFabiano Leit\u00e3o, a trumpeter who has spent years using his instrument to criticise Bolsonaro, turned up\u200b to mark the day of history with a rendition of Chopin\u2019s Funeral March that symbolised the former president\u2019s downfall. \u200b\u201cIt\u2019s the end! It\u2019s the end of this guy!\u201d Leit\u00e3o\u200b said as he pulled out his trumpet.\n\nAfter playing the sombre composition, the leftwing musician\u200b \u200blaunched into a lively samba, capturing the joy many Brazilians feel at the demise of a politician they blame for attacking their country\u2019s democracy, environment and minorities. \u201cThe extreme right is a mechanism\u200b of destruction of countries. It destroys everything: healthcare, science, technology, education, culture. It destroys it all. So this is a historic moment for this county,\u201d Leit\u00e3o said. \u201cJustice is done, comrades!\u201d\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s senator son, Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, called the verdict political persecution and Donald Trump said the conviction was \u201cvery surprising\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn\u2019t get away with it at all,\u201d said the US president who has spent recent months trying to pressure Brazil\u2019s supreme court and government into halting Bolsonaro\u2019s trial with a campaign of tariffs and sanctions.\n\n\u201cThe United States will respond accordingly to this witch hunt\u200b,\u201d tweeted the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, calling the conviction \u201cunjust\u201d.\n\nEduardo Bolsonaro, another son of the former president, told Reuters he expected the US to apply further sanctions against officials following his father\u2019s conviction.\n\nIn a post on social media, Brazil\u2019s foreign ministry rejected the statement from US officials, saying \u201cthreats like those made today by the US secretary of state Marco Rubio \u2026 will not intimidate our democracy\u201d.\n\nThe former president did not attend court this week, remaining in his nearby mansion, where he is under house arrest and police officers have been stationed to ensure he does not flee to one of Bras\u00edlia\u2019s foreign embassies.\n\nProgressive elation at the downfall of a president blamed for rampant environmental destruction, hundreds of thousands of Covid deaths and attacks on minorities, has been tempered by the realisation that his political movement remains very much alive. Some fear Fux\u2019s questioning of the judges\u2019 authority over the case could open the door to legal challenges and even the trial\u2019s annulment in the future.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t declare Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s political death,\u201d said Dr Camila Rocha, a political scientist from the Brazilian Centre for Analysis and Planning, who studies the Brazilian right.\n\nRocha expected supporters of the former president to keep fighting to rescue their leader from jail. Likely strategies include trying to elect a large number of rightwing senators in next year\u2019s elections who could impeach members of the supreme court considered Bolsonaro\u2019s foes; petitioning Donald Trump to heap more pressure on Brazil over Bolsonaro\u2019s plight; and trying to ensure that a pro-Bolsonaro candidate beats Lula in the 2026 presidential election. Their hope was that a rightwing president might grant Bolsonaro a pardon, although the supreme court could torpedo those plans, she said.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ll continue trying various ways of getting Bolsonaro out of jail and to uphold his leadership and keep him visible,\u201d she predicted.\n\nIn recent weeks, pro-Bolsonaro lawmakers have been pushing the idea of an amnesty for their leader and others who were involved in the coup attempt and the 8 January 2023 riots in Bras\u00edlia. They claim such forgiveness would help pacify a politically divided country.\n\nBut Fabio Victor, the author of a book about military involvement in Brazilian politics called Camouflaged Power, said he believed an amnesty would serve as an \u201cincentive to illegality\u201d. \u201cIt would send an awful signal \u2013 it would undoubtedly represent a setback to democracy,\u201d he warned.\n\nThis article was amended on 12 September 2025 to reflect that at the time of first publication three out of five judges had convicted Jair Bolsonaro, but that was later updated to four."

                "text": "The two-bedroom apartment in Bel\u00e9m became Suelen Freitas\u2019s home in 2020, when she moved her family to the same building as her elderly mother. On the edge of the Amazon rainforest, it was where her story played out for five years, from enduring the Covid pandemic, to watching her two children get into the university.\n\nBut in March everything changed. An eviction notice gave them and their neighbours 30 days to vacate their apartments. One by one, all 12 families were forced out. \u201cIt was very painful,\u201d Freitas said.\n\nThe reason, she was told, was that the building\u2019s owner planned to convert all of the flats into short-term rentals for Cop30, the annual climate summit which is scheduled to take place in the Brazilian city in November.\n\nThis year\u2019s summit, which began with an idealistic dream that the world would come to see the climate crisis for themselves in the rainforest, is increasingly enmeshed in anger and recriminations over sky-high accommodation costs and accusations that poorer countries are being forced out of the meetings.\n\nFreitas\u2019s story has become an all too common one in a city which, even before it was chosen to host the summit, was suffering a housing shortage and the country\u2019s second-highest rental costs.\n\n\u201cCop30 was just the cherry on top,\u201d said Priscilla Santos, the co-founder of the Rede Amaz\u00f4nidas pelo Clima thinktank. She credits the big real estate companies that operate in the city with triggering the lodging crisis.\n\n\u201cThey immediately moved to secure exclusive deals with high-end property owners and promised to rent them out to foreigners at outrageous prices,\u201d she said.\n\nLocal government picked up the idea and Cop30 was presented as a money-making opportunity on social media and beyond. Promotional material found by the Guardian encouraged local people to \u201ctake advantage of this great opportunity to earn even more\u201d.\n\nLured by the prospect of once-in-a-lifetime profits, landlords soon started favouring short-term rentals for Cop30 at the expense of the city\u2019s residents.\n\nFreitas\u2019s husband, who is an Uber driver, spent the 30 days after their eviction notice scanning the streets for rental listings. Each time the conversations were the same: \u201cIs it for Cop? No? Then we\u2019re not renting to you.\u201d\n\nIt was clear from the beginning that Bel\u00e9m would not have enough hotel rooms for the 50,000-odd people expected to attend the summit, so resorting to private homes was always a condition for the event to happen. But the way it has played out has in some cases been unfortunate.\n\nGiovana Silva* moved with her husband to a three-bedroom house with a back yard in February 2024, when the couple decided to start a family.\n\nA year into the three-year fixed-rate lease, however, the landlord approached them. In exchange for agreeing to vacate the house in November, Silva and her husband were offered about a tenth of the landlord\u2019s expected profits from Cop30 rentals.\n\nThe verbal agreement included some remodelling of the property, which was supposed to last a week. Instead, it dragged on for almost three months. \u201cThe worst part was being confined to our bedroom, the only part of the house that remained undisturbed,\u201d Silva said.\n\nSilva is pregnant and it pains her to think of what\u2019s to come: stripping the house of anything remotely personal, moving in with the in-laws for a month, and not knowing how the guests will treat her home or what it will look like when she returns. \u201cIt\u2019s much too little money for such a heavy burden,\u201d she said.\n\nBel\u00e9m residents feel that much of the global media has painted their city as poor, lacking in infrastructure and incapable of hosting Cop. To them the coverage seems colonial and stereotypical. Despite all the challenges, they are adamant that they want to host the summit, which Santos says is more than a symbolic choice.\n\n\u201cWe need people to come here and see the Amazon for what it really is, beyond exotified or romanticised notions,\u201d she said.\n\nThe event has already created a ripple effect. \u201cEveryday people have started to perceive themselves as being affected by the climate crisis. This discussion, once niche, has now become commonplace,\u201d Santos said.\n\n\u201cThe lady who cleans my house, who months ago confused Cop with the football World Cup [Copa, in Brazilian Portuguese], not only recognises the international importance of the event, but she now understands what climate change is and how it affects her life,\u201d said the lawyer Ieda Andrade.\n\nAndrade founded Conex\u00e3o Cop30, an accommodation micro-platform that connects hosts and guests by word of mouth.

The move, which cost over $200,000 and required them to take out a home equity loan, was successfully completed despite the challenges posed by hurricane season.

                "text": "When Dr. Scott Twentyman and Cindy Doughty of Rodanthe, NC, bought their three-story beach house in 2002, extreme weather and beach erosion weren\u2019t issues they worried about.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on our radar at the time,\u201d Twentyman tells Realtor.com\u00ae. \u201cWe never even thought of it.\u201d\n\nBut over time, Rodanthe eroded nearly 13 feet per year, according to some estimates, ultimately putting the couple\u2019s dream home at risk. So, they had to move\u2014but they weren\u2019t going without their house!\n\nThe perfect storm\n\nTwentyman and Doughty saw several of their neighbors\u2019 houses fall into the Atlantic Ocean back in 2019, when the Outer Banks was hit by three nor\u2019easters in a row, including Hurricane Dorian.\n\n\u201cWhen one of the houses went down, one of the neighbor\u2019s pilings crashed down through our back door, and our first floor had 2 feet of water in it,\u201d Doughty recalls. \u201cIt was crazy.\u201d\n\nThe couple knew they had to take action\u2014and fast.\n\n\u201cIt was clear we had to move or lose the house,\u201d says Twentyman. \u201cWe had no choice.\u201d\n\nIf they put the house on the market, they feared they would get a lowball offer, since the home was uninhabitable at that point.\n\n\u201cPlus, we could never get something like this house again, so we really didn\u2019t want to sell it,\u201d notes Twentyman.\n\n\u201cAnd you can never replace the view,\u201d Doughty adds. \u201cThis is not something you can just go out and buy somewhere.\u201d\n\nThe solution? Move the house entirely. Luckily, they were \u201cfortunate\u201d to own a double lot, Twentyman explains, so moving the house was actually a viable option.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, there would have been no empty lots to move it to, since Hatteras Island is built out,\u201d he says.\n\nThe price of saving their home\n\nThe couple ultimately made the decision to relocate their home 100 feet further inland from the encroaching beach. While not a far move, it was still a significant undertaking that came with a hefty price tag\u2014over $200,000, all of which they had to pay out of their own pockets.\n\nThe reason for this substantial out-of-pocket expense, Twentyman explains, is that insurance companies typically refuse to cover the costs of proactively moving a home, even if it\u2019s clearly endangered by natural forces.\n\n\u201cThe insurance company says the house has to fall into the ocean before you get paid,\u201d Twentyman laments. \u201cIt\u2019s idiotic.\u201d\n\nIn order to save their home, the couple had to take out a home equity loan on another property they owned to finance the move themselves.\n\n\u201cWe hired a company called Expert House Movers, and they certainly earned their name,\u201d says Twentyman, explaining that they were the same team to move the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse in the late 1990s.\n\nDue to the same erosion problem, the historic structure need to be relocated 2,900 feet from the spot on which it had stood since 1870.\n\nKnowing they handled such an important project gave the couple \u201cconfidence\u201d to trust their own home would be moved with care.\n\nTime was of the essence\n\nThey had to completely remove the first floor\u2014which consisted of an entryway, laundry room, and stairway\u2014so they could put girders under the house on top of the pilings to support the weight of the structure.\n\nAnd because hurricane season was underway, it was a race against time.\n\n\u201cOnce the house is gone, you can\u2019t do anything with that land\u2014it\u2019s a total loss,\u201d says Twentyman. \u201cThe house goes down\u2014that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nSecuring the necessary permits and completing construction took several long months.\n\n\u201cIt was very stressful,\u201d says Doughty.\n\nBut luckily, the actual act of moving the house only took about 20 minutes.\n\n\u201cI was really surprised how quickly that part happened,\u201d Doughty adds.\n\nThe big move\n\nShockingly, they didn\u2019t have to take anything out of the house before it was moved.\n\n\u201cI just assumed we\u2019d have to empty out the house and take all the glassware off the shelves, but they told me we didn\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d recalls Doughty.\n\nThough the night of the move was marked by heavy storms, a brief calm allowed the house to be transported.\n\n\u201cThe wind died down, the rain stopped, and it got really quiet,\u201d says Doughty. \u201cI still get goosebumps just thinking about it.\u201d\n\nAfter the home was moved, the pilings were no longer driven into sand\u2014they were now sitting on bedrock.\n\n\u201cKnowing it\u2019s on bedrock gives us more peace of mind, especially when bad weather strikes,\u201d says Twentyman.\n\nNo second thoughts\n\nThe couple says they have absolutely no regrets about moving their house and would advise other people in coastal communities to consider doing the same.\n\n\u201cIt was a big leap of faith, but it paid off,\u201d says Doughty. \u201cWe both have such a strong emotional connection to this house, and we didn\u2019t want to lose it.\u201d\n\nAlthough the experience was stressful, Twentyman says it actually drew them closer together as a couple, \u201cbecause we were in this battle together, side by side.\u201d"

                "text": "Several popular brands of laundry detergent sheets are little more effective \u2013 and in one case, less effective \u2013 than plain water in front loading washing machines, testing by consumer group Choice has found.\n\nA relatively new form of detergent, laundry detergent sheets are usually advertised as an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional forms of detergent such as powder and liquid, as they don\u2019t contain single-use plastics.\n\n\u201cIn principle, I don\u2019t know why they shouldn\u2019t be able to perform as well,\u201d said Chris Barnes, who manages product testing reviews at Choice, and was involved in this year\u2019s test of more than 50 laundry detergents \u2013 including powders, liquids, capsules and sheets. \u201cI suspect they\u2019re not actually delivering as much actual detergent in each dose.\u201d\n\nChoice tests detergents annually to find the best and worst products on shelves for front and top loading washing machines. A score above 70% for front loaders and above 60% for top loaders were what the experts recommended for an effective wash, as top loaders are generally less efficient at washing than front loaders. Front loaders have longer wash cycles, which means they\u2019re able to wash the clothes more thoroughly, Barnes said.\n\nSign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning\n\nFor the second year in a row, Omo products cleaned up, taking out the first, second and third spots for front loaders. Omo powder scored 81%, followed by the Omo Ultimate 3 in 1 capsules and Omo Ultimate 3 in 1 Sensitive capsules with scores of 77% and 76% respectively.\n\nCapsules, which tend to be the most expensive detergent category, were hit or miss for front loaders. The highest scoring capsule, the Omo Ultimate 3 in 1 Sensitive capsules, receiving 77% \u2013 at $1.29 a wash \u2013 but the lowest scoring capsule, Active Expert 3 in 1 laundry capsules, scored just 52%.\n\nHowever, in front loaders and top loaders, laundry sheets ranked at the bottom of the list, performing little better than water. For front loaders, Skipper\u2019s laundry detergent sheets scored 46% and Lucent Globe\u2019s scored 45%. Restor\u2019s Fresh Linen laundry detergent sheets scored 44%. Water alone was ranked at 45%.\n\nA Restor spokesperson responded to the score, saying: \u201cWe have conducted extensive independent testing on Restor laundry detergent sheets, where the new formula demonstrated incredibly strong performance in both cleaning power and stain removal.\u201d\n\nA Skipper spokesperson said : \u201cThe testing focused on stain removal of specific soiling types, not whether the products remove oils and bacteria to keep clothes hygienic and fresh.\u201d\n\n\u201cComparing our sheets to plain water makes for a catchy headline, but it does not reflect their everyday utility in the household.\u201d\n\nAldi\u2019s Green Action laundry liquid concentrate was the next lowest non-sheet detergent for front loaders, scoring 45%. \u201cWe will investigate this allegation, however we are confident of our stringent processes in place that ensure our product quality meets and exceeds shoppers\u2019 expectations,\u201d an Aldi spokesperson said.\n\nFor top loaders, Aldi\u2019s Trimat Advanced Laundry powder concentrate emerged as the most effective, with a score of 66%, beating Omo Powder Ultimate by one point.\n\nWhile Omo\u2019s top-scoring products cost upwards of $0.83 per wash, three products with scores between 71% and 74% cost less than $0.30 per wash: Active Expert laundry powder, Aldi\u2019s Trimat Advanced laundry liquid concentrate and Coles\u2019s Ultra Concentrate laundry powder.\n\nBarnes said that a typical load of laundry for most consumers is not very dirty, so in those cases a mild or weak detergent will actually do the job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that there is a good mix out there of really good performers, but also decent and cheap performers,\u201d said Barnes.\n\n\u201cIt is actually worth doing a little bit of homework just to see what the cost per wash is \u2013 it can be quite surprising.\u201d\n\nHowever, Barnes said buying a better washing machine might be a more sensible use of money than spending more on detergents.\n\n\u201cA large amount of the actual cleaning process \u2026 is actually done by the mechanical action of the machine itself,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA good detergent will not make up the difference for a really terrible washing machine.\u201d"

                "text": "Bar mops tend to be smaller than a typical kitchen towel, which makes sense: When used in actual watering holes, they\u2019re often kept folded along a bar\u2019s narrow glass rail.\n\nA Utopia bar mop measures 16 by 19 inches. (In contrast, our top-pick kitchen towels, Williams Sonoma All Purpose Pantry Towels, each measure 20 by 30 inches.) However, in our extensive absorption testing, the Utopia towel rivaled and even outperformed several more expensive kitchen towels from other brands, despite its diminutive size.\n\n\u201cBar mops are generally made of terry cloth, as opposed to woven cotton,\u201d says Lesley Stockton, a senior staff writer on our kitchen team. \u201cThat makes them better for wiping up spills, cleaning counters, and drying pots and pans.\u201d\n\nBar mops are less ideal, Lesley says, for such food-related tasks as pressing tofu or drying leafy greens, since they \u201ctend to release more lint than woven kitchen towels.\u201d\n\nUtopia\u2019s bar mops are fashioned from ring-spun cotton \u2014 which, as we note in our bath towels guide, \u201ccreates finer, smoother strands of yarn\u201d and a more high-quality fabric than regular cotton.\n\nI always store some Utopia towels under my kitchen sink for easy access so that I can quickly wipe up everyday meal-prep messes as needed, and I keep a few more near my front door for when the dog finishes a rain-soaked walk.\n\nMy most frequent use for them, though, is in the bathroom, where they\u2019ve become my preferred washcloth for doing my twice-daily skincare regimen. I soak an entire towel with hot water to remove cleanser from my face, neck, and chest; the towel\u2019s nubbly texture offers a gentle, feel-good exfoliation, and since the bar mop is oversized compared with a typical washcloth, it makes my routine feel a little more luxurious.\n\nThen I wring out the towel and use it to wipe up all the water I\u2019ve splashed across the vanity and onto the bathroom mirror. (I\u2019m very messy.) It easily handles those two tasks back to back, and after quickly drying out on a towel rack, it\u2019s ready to handle other messes.\n\nOur kitchen towel testers have given the Utopia bar mops low marks for being \u201cnot that attractive\u201d compared with other kitchen towels, and I agree that they can look disproportionately stumpy when slung over a towel rack or through a drawer handle \u2014 but I\u2019ve come up with a few styling hacks that can elevate their look.\n\nMy favorite technique is to roll (rather than fold) several of them and display them together in a basket that fits in a handy space close to the sink. (A wooden wine crate or similar container also works.)\n\nFor my two-bathroom home, I keep some in a decorative storage bin that sits atop a toilet tank, and I put others in a standing storage unit. When I have guests over, I put a small wastebasket on the floor nearby to encourage folks to use a fresh hand towel on a bathroom visit and then toss it into the wastebasket below.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever reached for a bathroom\u2019s lone hand towel and found it damp thanks to the person who used it previously, you can imagine how much nicer it is to use a fresh one every time\u2014especially in a house full of people.\n\nAfter more than a year of using the Utopia bar mops, I\u2019ve found that I can easily keep them looking bright by washing them with other whites in warm or hot water and adding OxiClean or white vinegar to the cycle. The best part is that when they do start to get dingy, I feel no remorse about demoting them to rag duty (and, one day, to my textile recycling heap).\n\nAt less than $2 a pop, they\u2019re an amazingly bargain-priced way to add a little bougie to your bathroom.\n\nThis article was edited by Alexander Aciman and Annemarie Conte."

The church is widely known for mass weddings, pairing thousands of couples who often are from different countries.\n\nHan did not speak to reporters as she arrived at the Seoul court on Monday for a hearing on the warrant request. After an hours-long hearing, the court issued its decision in the early hours of Tuesday as Han awaited the verdict at a detention centre near Seoul, where she will now be held.\n\nThe Unification Church had criticised investigators\u2019 attempts to arrest Han, noting that she appeared for questioning last week while still recovering from a heart procedure earlier this month, and accused them of disrespecting an \u201cinternationally respected religious leader\u201d.\n\nFormer first lady Kim was arrested and charged last month on allegations including bribery, stock manipulation and meddling in the selection of a legislative candidate. Kim has denied the allegations, calling them \u201cfalse information\u201d.\n\nThe lawmaker, Kweon Seong-dong, a staunch Yoon loyalist who was arrested last week, has denied receiving money from the church. Investigators also last week visited the headquarters of his conservative People Power party to obtain documents in order to examine claims that Unification Church members signed up en masse ahead of the party\u2019s 2023 leadership race to boost Kweon\u2019s candidacy.\n\nSouth Korea has a long tradition of politicians courting religious groups, from powerful Protestant lobbies to homegrown movements around self-proclaimed messiahs. In a country that is majority secular, religious groups wield disproportionate political influence.\n\nMembers of the ruling Democratic party, including leader Jung Chung-rae, have demanded the People Power party\u2019s dissolution should the allegations be proven, citing violations of constitutional church-state separation. Hwang Myeong-seon, one of the party\u2019s lawmakers, said \u201cpolitical groups that parasitise on religious power no longer have the right to exist.\u201d\n\nFormer conservative heavyweight Hong Jun-pyo turned against his old party, calling it \u201cno different from a political party dominated by pseudo-religious cult leaders.\u201d\n\nHan\u2019s arrest follows Japan\u2019s court order to dissolve the Unification Church in March after former prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s assassination by a man whose family was said to be bankrupted by church donations.\n\nThe investigation into Kim is one of three special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul\u2019s new liberal government investigating Yoon\u2019s presidency. Kim faces her first criminal trial on Wednesday, which her lawyers said she would attend.\n\nThe others focus on Yoon\u2019s planning and execution of his short-lived martial law imposition on 3 December and his government\u2019s alleged cover-up of a marine\u2019s drowning death during a 2023 flood rescue operation.\n\nYoon\u2019s martial law lasted only a few hours before the liberal-led legislature voted to lift it. He was impeached later in December and formally removed from office in April. He was re-arrested in July and now faces insurrection and other charges.\n\nProsecutors have summoned him for questioning on Wednesday over allegations he ordered drone missions to North Korea to create a pretext for the failed martial law. Yoon also has a bail hearing scheduled for Friday, though he has continuously boycotted ongoing court proceedings and refused prosecutor questioning.\n\nHis wife has been investigated over various criminal allegations, stemming from events both before and during her husband\u2019s presidency. The suspicions include accepting luxury gifts through an intermediary from a Unification Church official who allegedly sought various business favours, including the church\u2019s participation in a Cambodian development project. The official, who has been arrested, is also suspected of providing 100m won ($71,800) in bribes to Kweon.\n\nHan was questioned for nearly 10 hours on Wednesday last week and denied the allegations against her in brief comments to reporters.\n\nHan is the top leader of the church, officially called the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, which her husband founded in 1954.\n\nWith Associated Press and Reuters"

The swift verdict arrived hours after jurors were sent to deliberate on Tuesday morning.\n\nLee was charged with killing Minu Jo, 6, and Yuna Jo, 8, in June 2018. The children\u2019s remains were found inside luggage at an abandoned storage unit in Auckland in August 2022.\n\nLee, who is a New Zealand citizen, had traveled to South Korea and changed her name in 2018, shortly after the children are believed to have been killed. She was born in South Korea and went by the name Ji Eun Lee previously.\n\nLee, 45, was extradited from South Korea in November 2022.

The children were killed seven months after Lee\u2019s husband died from cancer.\n\nThe children\u2019s remains were discovered after Lee stopped paying rental fees for the Auckland storage unit when she ran into financial difficulties in 2022. The locker\u2019s contents were auctioned online and the buyers found the bodies inside.\n\nJustice Geoffrey Venning ordered that Lee remain in custody until she is sentenced on Nov. 26. Murder carries a mandatory life sentence in New Zealand, with judges required to set a prison term of at least 10 years before an offender can apply for parole.\n\nVenning said when the trial began on Sept. 8 it would be distressing to Lee and granted her permission to watch the proceedings from another room in the courthouse. She returned to the dock for Tuesday\u2019s verdict, and stood with her head bowed and her hair covering her face, New Zealand news outlets reported."

                "text": "The ABC has been ordered by the federal court to pay Antoinette Lattouf $150,000 in pecuniary penalties for terminating her employment.\n\nIn a strongly worded judgment the court found the broadcaster had \u201cabjectly surrendered\u201d to pro-Israel lobbyists and \u201clet down the Australian public badly\u201d.\n\nThe penalty is for breaching the Fair Work Act and the ABC\u2019s enterprise agreement when it unlawfully terminated the casual presenter for holding a political opinion opposing the Israeli military campaign in Gaza.\n\nThe pecuniary penalty is on top of a previous order to pay Lattouf compensation of $70,000.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nThe court found the ABC\u2019s conduct was a particularly serious breach of employment law because the ABC\u2019s senior managers knew there was an \u201corganised political campaign\u201d by pro-Israel lobbyists to have Lattouf removed from air.\n\n\u201cThe ABC\u2019s position became more difficult, caught between the campaign by pro-Israel lobbyists, its statutory obligation of impartiality, including the appearance of impartiality, and Ms Lattouf pouring fuel on the fire by making a social media post that was obviously going to be controversial,\u201d Justice Darryl Rangiah said in his published judgment.\n\n\u201cThe ABC\u2019s response was to surrender to the lobbyists\u2019 political campaign by sacrificing Ms Lattouf. It did so for spurious reasons and without giving Ms Lattouf the opportunity to defend herself.\u201d\n\nThe decision on penalties brings to an end a highly charged dispute which began in December 2023 when the journalist\u2019s on-air shifts were cut short three days into a five-day stint hosting ABC Radio\u2019s Sydney Mornings.\n\nIn June Rangiah found the ABC contravened section 772 of the Fair Work Act and breached five clauses of the ABC\u2019s enterprise agreement.\n\nThe amount is three times as much as the ABC submitted it should pay, but far short of the $350,000 Lattouf wanted.\n\nThe ABC had admitted it acted unlawfully and said the total penalty imposed should be between $37,560 and $56,340.\n\nRangiah found the main decision-maker, former chief content officer Chris Oliver-Taylor, \u201cblithely ignored the risk that the ABC would be in contravention of the enterprise agreement and forged ahead with his decision to terminate\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe did not bother to consult the human relations and legal experts within the ABC,\u201d Rangiah wrote. \u201cThat was, I infer, because he was keen to \u201cbeat the story\u201d that The Australian intended to publish. I accept Ms Lattouf\u2019s submission that the ABC acted with disdain for her legal rights under the enterprise agreement.\u201d\n\nRangiah rejected Lattouf\u2019s submission that the ABC lacked contrition because it had not terminated the employment of the director of audio, Ben Latimer, for his role.\n\nWhile Oliver-Taylor has left the ABC, Latimer was promoted to the executive after the events of 2023. \u201cAlthough I did not accept significant aspects of Mr Latimer\u2019s evidence, it was not his decision to remove Ms Lattouf from her employment,\u201d Rangiah said.\n\n\u201cThere is no obvious basis for the termination of Mr Latimer\u2019s employment. I do not consider that Mr Latimer remaining employed by the ABC demonstrates a lack of contrition.\u201d\n\nThe ABC\u2019s failure to investigate who leaked news of her termination to The Australian demonstrated its apology to Lattouf for distress caused \u201chas its limits\u201d and the broadcaster has \u201climited contrition for the broader effects of its unlawful actions\u201d on the journalist, the judgment found.\n\nAt a hearing earlier this month, Lattouf\u2019s lawyers argued for the maximum penalty because of \u201csignificant pressure\u201d put on senior management by Ita Buttrose, the broadcaster\u2019s former chair, to sack Lattouf.\n\nThe trigger for Lattouf\u2019s sudden removal on the Wednesday after her shift was an Instagram post she shared from Human Rights Watch that said Israel had used starvation as a \u201cweapon of war\u201d in Gaza.\n\nThe broadcaster asked the court to take into consideration the finding by Rangiah that Lattouf\u2019s conduct in making the Human Rights Watch post was \u201cill-advised and inconsiderate of her employer\u201d.\n\nThe ABC has been ordered to pay the penalty to Lattouf within 28 days."

The lawsuit claims that LAFS misled the Department of Education during a 2017 audit, asserting that nearly all federal funds received\u2014approximately $85 million annually\u2014were obtained through fraudulent means. In response, LAFS plans to file a motion to dismiss the complaint, denying the allegations and stating that previous investigations by the Department of Education have already settled these claims.",

                "text": "Two former executives at the Los Angeles Film School allege in a lawsuit that the school has operated a massive student loan scam for years that involves arranging for thousands of fake job placements for its graduates.\n\nThe executives also claim that the school, located on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, lied to the Department of Education during a 2017 audit in an effort to cover up the fraud.\n\nDave Phillips, the school\u2019s former VP of career development, and Ben Chaib, the former VP of admissions, filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the school in 2024. The suit, unsealed earlier this year, alleges that \u201cnearly all\u201d of the tens of millions of dollars the school receives each year from federal student aid programs is the result of fraud.\n\nThe suit accuses the school of \u201choodwinking\u201d thousands of students with false claims about graduates\u2019 prospects for employment.\n\nThe school offers two- and four-year degrees in film and music production, animation and other fields, with tuition ranging from $40,000 to $80,000 per program, according to its website.\n\nAccording to the suit, Phillips \u201cobserved the vast majority of LAFS graduates were not able to obtain entry level positions.\u201d The lawsuit quotes an internal agenda stating that most graduates \u201creport a yearly income of 0-$5,000 in their field of study.\u201d\n\nLAFS receives about $85 million per year in federal assistance, of which about $60 million comes from student loans, the suit states. Another $19 million comes in veterans\u2019 education grants.\n\nThe school is owned by James \u201cBill\u201d Heavener, the CEO, and three partners, who also own and control Full Sail University in Winter Park, Fla. Like LAFS, Full Sail also offers online and in-person instruction in entertainment production and related fields. According to the complaint, Full Sail receives $377 million per year in federal assistance.\n\nThe two former executives allege in the lawsuit that LAFS and Full Sail engaged in fraud in order to meet a key accreditation benchmark \u2014 namely, that at least 70% of graduates are able to find work in their field. If they failed to maintain their accreditation, the schools risked losing eligibility for federal student aid.\n\nThe complaint alleges that LAFS executives estimated that, at best, 20% of graduates would be able to find work on their own, and so for the remaining 50%, they had to \u201cengineer the gigs.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, LAFS paid Ivar Music Group and other entities nearly $1 million from 2010-17 to \u201chire\u201d its graduates for two-day jobs. The suit alleges that LAFS controlled who would be hired, when they would work and how much they would be paid.\n\nThe suit states that the two schools \u201cself-financed thousands of temporary employment opportunities for their graduates through schemes with non-profits and paid-off vendors to give the false impression to incoming students and federal regulators that their graduates were gainfully employed.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Film School is expected to file a motion to dismiss the complaint on Oct. 1. In a joint statement of the case filed last week, the school\u2019s attorneys denied the claims, saying that Phillips and Chaib are attempting \u201cto resuscitate time-barred and erroneous allegations, which were already thoroughly investigated and settled by the Department of Education.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower complaint alleges that in addition to arranging for fake jobs, LAFS also illegally tied compensation for its sales team to student enrollment.\n\nThe suit further alleges that LAFS executives lied to Department of Education auditors by denying the existence of the incentive compensation system and failing to disclose the link to Ivar Music Group.\n\nIn the statement filed last week, LAFS says that the Department of Education conducted a \u201ccomprehensive investigation\u201d into the allegations from 2017-2020, resulting in the settlement.\n\nThe Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges last renewed the school\u2019s accreditation in 2023 for a five-year period. The ACCSC did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPhillips, a former William Morris agent, was a vice president in charge of job placement at LAFS, as well as an adviser to the board. Chaib was recruited to work for the school after working in admissions at other for-profit colleges, including Heald College and the University of Phoenix. Each worked at LAFS for 12 years and were members of the top-level executive team.\n\nPhillips left the school in 2022. According to a suit the school filed against him, his contract was not renewed. The school alleged in the lawsuit that Phillips\u2019 counsel later sent LAFS a demand letter that included quotations from his conversations with Heavener and Tammy Elliott, the school\u2019s president. Heavener and Elliott sued, alleging that Phillips had invaded their privacy by secretly recording them. That suit was later dismissed.\n\nAccording to the filing made last week, the school reached a settlement with Phillips in 2023. A separate settlement was reached with Chaib in 2021. LAFS alleges that both released their claims against the school at that time, but are now engaged in \u201ca campaign to extract additional money.\u201d\n\nPhillips and Chaib filed the whistleblower lawsuit in June 2024, seeking to recover fraudulently obtained student aid funds on behalf of the U.S. government. Private individuals who help bring such misconduct to light can reap 25-30% of any recovery.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice opted not to get involved in the case last May, leading to the suit being unsealed.\n\nAn attorney for the school, Mazda Antia, declined to comment to Variety.\n\nThe federal government issued a series of regulations in the 2010s to crack down on for-profit colleges, and state and federal investigations led to the closures of Corinthian Colleges \u2014 the owner of Heald College \u2014 and ITT Technical Institute.\n\nIn 2009, the University of Phoenix paid $67.5 million to settle a whistleblower action brought by two former employees. The case involved allegations of incentive-based compensation for recruiting students. The two former employees were awarded $19 million.\n\nThe Department of Education fined Heald College in the amount of $29.7 million in 2015, after determining that the school had lied about its job placement statistics."

However, he said: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t justify it, I accept that I drank more than I should have that night.\u201d\n\nHe said he had reached out to the paramedics and apologised and that the incident was \u201ccompletely out of character\u201d.\n\nThe premier, Chris Minns, told reporters that he wanted to be \u201cfrank\u201d about why the decision was made, despite the incidents.\n\n\u201cThis decision was not made based on who had the mistake-free, perfect record. I want to make it clear that for me, it was based on who I believe should be in the commissioner chair on New South Wales\u2019 worst day, and when the public\u2019s in danger, and the New South Wales police force needs exceptional leadership,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s led the Reconstruction Authority. He\u2019s had the most difficult command in the New South Wales police, not just for one year or two years, but for over a decade.\u201d\n\nLanyon was seconded to the acting chief executive of the NSW Reconstruction Authority, the state\u2019s disaster recovery agency, in April.\n\nHe had been a deputy police commissioner since 2019, and had been considered among the frontrunners for the commissioner role in 2021 when Webb took the reins. He was reportedly seconded to the Reconstruction Authority due to \u201cfractures in his relationship\u201d with Webb.\n\nIn his nearly four-decade career with the force, he has led major crime-fighting commands against organised crime. He\u2019s also overseen the state\u2019s metropolitan policing operations, making him responsible for thousands of frontline officers.\n\nLanyon was responsible for establishing Operation Amarok, which targets high-risk domestic violence offenders.\n\nLanyon said, as commissioner, he will be focused on tackling organised crime, youth crime and \u201cstrengthening community safety in our regions, and supporting victims of domestic and family violence.\n\n\u201cI also want to strengthen the culture of the New South Wales police force, [and] cultivate a culture of respect, professionalism, and fairness,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want every officer, every member of the executive, part of one team, united behind the forces, goals, motivated by purpose and community.\u201d\n\n\u201cI acknowledge Commissioner Karen Webb for her distinguished 38-year career in the police force, she leaves a legacy of achievement as the first woman to lead the New South Wales Police forces and as a commissioner who delivered enduring reforms.\u201d\n\nWebb officially retires from the force on 30 September. Peter Thurtell is currently acting in her role.\n\nWebb\u2019s time in the top job was also met with controversy. She was widely criticised over her handling of the alleged murders of Luke Davis and Jesse Baird, allegedly at the hands of police officer Beau Lamarre-Condon.\n\nIn 2023, she denied allegations of a \u201ccover-up\u201d over the Tasering of 95-year-old Clare Nowland. Webb was also scrutinised over $687,000 paid out to three media advisors in two years.\n\nIn a statement after she announced her resignation, Minns congratulated Webb saying she had \u201cstood tall in moments of crisis, led significant reform to policing, and staunchly defended law and order in this state\u201d."

It was not possible, he added, to jam frequencies \u201cdue to nearby civilian use of the electromagnetic spectrum, for radio communications, cell phones and the like\u201d \u2013 while shooting down unidentified craft is an unrealistic option near heavily populated areas.\n\n\u200b\u200bIf a Russian link is proved, it would be a significant moment for Nato, which is already on a heightened state of alert. It is two weeks after 19 Russian decoy drones crossed the border into Poland, an incident which has been followed by further incursions into Romania and \u2013 in case Europe had not got the message \u2013 a 12-minute flight into Estonian airspace by three Russian MiG-31 jets over the Baltic Sea on Friday.\n\nThe Polish incident alone was enough to prompt Nato to set up Operation Eastern Sentry, enhanced air policing over eastern Europe, with extra jets supplied by the UK, France, Germany and Denmark. But Copenhagen is about 300 miles from the nearest Russian territory, the exclave of Kaliningrad, and is not a location that Moscow was expected to target successfully.\n\nAt the same time, it is a reminder how far new and relatively inexpensive Russian drones can reach. Russian Gerberas, the $10,000 decoy drones that flew into Poland, are generally considered to have a maximum range of about 370 miles (enough to reach Copenhagen from Kaliningrad). The better-known $75,000 Shaheds can reach further, probably more than 1,000 miles, depending on the exact configuration.\n\nThere is also speculation the drones that approached Copenhagen airport were launched from a ship in the Baltic. Though so far unproven, it is theoretically possible, and would have given Denmark little time to react.\n\nEven if there is no Russian link to the Copenhagen incident, the sudden boldness of the Kremlin in Poland and Estonia is new territory for Nato. The US president, Donald Trump, seems little interested in the string of incidents, making no reference to subject in his rambling speech at the UN on Tuesday \u2013 and it is European allies that have already been forced to step up air defences with extra fighter jets.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Denmark\u2019s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, also made a tentative link between the overnight drone flights and the hacking episode that has led to flights being disrupted in Brussels, Berlin and Heathrow airports since Friday.\n\nA ransomware attack \u2013 which usually originates in Russia \u2013 knocked out automated check-in systems provided by Collins Aerospace and forced the cancellation of dozens of flights. Though a Russian link cannot be confirmed in this case yet, the possibility has to be considered.\n\nSome experts, such as the former White House adviser Fiona Hill, have emphasised that while the west does not consider itself at war with Russia, Moscow has a different view. Its main focus remains the invasion of Ukraine, but from a Kremlin perspective it may be rational to try to impose greater costs on Europe, which is increasingly becoming Kyiv\u2019s principal backer as the US pulls back.\n\nWhile there appears to be no intent to cause casualties, the recent incidents are an expensive nuisance and have already forced European Nato members to increase their active military deployment. Though Nato, meeting on Tuesday, said the alliance would use \u201call necessary military and non-military tools to defend ourselves\u201d, it is not yet obvious that Russia has been deterred."

Moscow denied it had been trying to target facilities on Polish soil.\n\nA similar incident occurred in Romania only a few days later when a drone flew into Romanian airspace before disappearing from the radar.\n\nAnd on Saturday three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered Estonian skies and remained there for 12 minutes, leading Nato jets to be scrambled. The incursions were part of a \"wider pattern of increasingly irresponsible Russian behaviour,\" Nato said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nIn recent days Poland stated it would shoot down any objects that violated its airspace, while Sweden promised to do the same if it spotted any Russian aircraft in its skies.\n\nIn response to Russia's incursions into Poland and Romania, Nato has pledged to move troops and fighter jets eastwards.\n\nPlanes from the UK, France, Germany and Denmark are taking part in air defence missions over Poland in a bid to bolster the alliance's eastern flank."

Hall was released in March after negotiations that were also led by Qatari officials.\n\nThe fate of Juya is unknown.

Famously private, Scott only discusses her donations through her website and does not confirm them until after the recipients do.\n\n\u201cThis extraordinary gift is a powerful vote of confidence in HBCUs and in the work of UNCF,\u201d the nonprofit\u2019s President and CEO Dr. Michael L. Lomax told The Associated Press in a statement. \u201cIt provides a once-in-a-generation opportunity for our member institutions to build permanent assets that will support students and campuses for decades to come.\u201d\n\nLomax said Scott\u2019s donation would be used for UNCF\u2019s pooled endowment, which aims to establish a $370 million fund \u2014 $10 million for each UNCF member HBCU. That fund will be invested and designed to pay out about 4% annually, which will then be divided among the HBCUs to help stabilize their budgets. Increasing HBCU endowments is a priority since they trail endowments at non-HBCUs by 70%, according to the UNCF.\n\nThe broader $1 billion fundraising effort is an attempt to help HBCUs address the funding disparity they face when compared to other colleges and universities. A 2023 study by philanthropic research group Candid and ABFE, a nonprofit that advocates for investments in Black communities, found that the eight Ivy League schools received $5.5 billion from the 1,000 largest US foundations compared to $45 million for the 99 HBCUs in 2019.\n\nSince Scott, a novelist who received the bulk of her fortune after divorcing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, signed the Giving Pledge in 2019, promising to donate more than half her wealth, HBCUs have been among her favorite grantees. She previously gave UNCF $10 million in 2020.\n\nThough Scott hasn\u2019t addressed HBCU donations specifically, she wrote in 2020 that her funding decisions were \u201cdriven by a deep belief in the value different backgrounds bring to problem-solving on any issue.\u201d\n\nScott hasn\u2019t made any announcements about her giving since she acknowledged $2 billion in gifts in 2024, bringing her total to $19.2 billion. According to Forbes, Scott\u2019s net worth is currently around $34 billion.\n\nHer unusual donations \u2014 which are much larger than most foundations give at one time and carry no restrictions on when they can be used or what they can be used for \u2014 financially strengthened the nonprofits that received them, said Phil Buchanan, president of The Center for Effective Philanthropy, which studied Scott\u2019s giving over three years.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t see the fears people predicted come to pass,\u201d said Buchanan, who disclosed that The Center for Effective Philanthropy received a one-time $10 million grant from Scott. Though some worried that the large gifts would cause the recipients to increase staffing too much or hurt their fundraising efforts, Buchanan said their study of 2,000 nonprofits saw little evidence of that. \u201cFolks are pretty prudent,\u201d he said. \u201cThis shows that if you carefully vet nonprofits, we can trust them to make good use of funds.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson that UNCF hopes other funders will learn, following Scott\u2019s example.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply grateful for MacKenzie Scott\u2019s continued support,\u201d Lomax said. \u201cBy entrusting UNCF to decide how best to use these funds, she affirms that HBCUs merit investment at this scale and her generosity will strengthen our member institutions and provide pathways to success for tomorrow\u2019s changemakers.\u201d"

As I base most of my knowledge of extreme wealth on Succession, being a billionaire looks as appealing as an impromptu game of baseball with the Roys.\n\nWith impeccable timing, as her ex-husband, Jeff, prepared to defend the dominance of Amazon during last week\u2019s congressional hearing, MacKenzie Scott, formerly Bezos, announced that she had begun the process of giving away the majority of her wealth.\n\nThe 50-year-old is estimated to be worth $60bn and last year she pledged to \u201ckeep going until the safe is empty\u201d; last week, she named the recipients of $1.7bn in donations, in part, she explained in a post on Medium, because of \u201ca dividend of privilege I\u2019d been overlooking: the attention I can call to organisations and leaders driving change\u201d.\n\nThe numbers are staggering and certainly transformative: millions upon millions given to traditionally black universities, to organisations working to fight climate change and economic inequality, to LGBTQ groups, to do with it as they see fit. Yet the mind boggles at the fact that these numbers, while only a start, barely make a dent in the fortune.\n\nThere is still nearly $58bn left to go, plus whatever baffling interest continues to accrue. The numbers remain incomprehensible. Perhaps it will make more sense when the safe is truly empty.\n\nReese Witherspoon: thrice snubbed, are you having a laugh, ref?\n\nI love awards ceremonies so much that I will happily sit through the traditionally excruciating \u201cnominations\u201d show just to whet my appetite for the main event.\n\nLast week, those for the 72nd Emmys were announced by Leslie Jones, who seems to have a similar level of enthusiasm for this stage of the game as I do.\n\nI realise now that it is my equivalent of sport. The post-match \u201csnubs and surprises\u201d chat is what I imagine football fans talk about at the pub, except instead of discussing tactics (sorry, I\u2019m very bad at this) and, er, substitutions (I did tell you), I\u2019m shouting about Reese Witherspoon and Normal People.\n\nWitherspoon managed the impressive feat of starring in three massive, award-magnet drama series this year \u2013 The Morning Show, Big Little Lies, Little Fires Everywhere \u2013 yet was snubbed on the acting front for all of them. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s fine about it, given that her production company made all three shows, and they have been honoured in other categories, but still, throw her a bone, Emmys! Nobody does uptight as well as her.\n\nThere were other notable snubs, for Unbelievable, and for Daisy Edgar-Jones in Normal People, with even Paul Mescal tweeting: \u201cThis only exists because of you.\u201d (Connell and Marianne 4 ever!) On the plus side, there was a lot of deserved yet surprising love for What We Do in the Shadows and Unorthodox. Even better, the event sets up a big battle, as both Jeremy Strong and Brian Cox are nominated for lead actor in Succession, continuing the father-son feud that never ends.\n\nNicholas Braun: Love in a Covid climate\n\nExcuse the ongoing Succession obsession, but the series was nominated for a mammoth 18 Emmys, with Variety declaring that it had \u201cstepped into the Game of Thrones void\u201d.\n\nOne of those nominations went to Nicholas Braun, who plays Cousin Greg, a man so appallingly spineless that he will inevitably end up running the world. In the same week as he found out he was up for an Emmy, Braun released his debut single, Antibodies (Do You Have The), a crowd-sourced, tongue-in-cheek, punk-pop anthem about trying to find love in a pandemic.\n\n\u201cCan you find a testing site/ Before you spend the night?\u201d goes one line, which is both very funny and oddly depressing. Braun told Rolling Stone that his test for the antibodies had come up negative.\n\nBraun said boredom had driven him to songwriting. Succession\u2019s third season was due to start filming in April and has been pushed back to autumn, although Matthew Macfadyen, also Emmy-nominated as Tom, was unsure. \u201cI think it changes week to week \u2013 or day to day, really,\u201d Macfadyen told the Hollywood Reporter. At this rate, surely, it\u2019s only a matter of time before Shiv\u2019s reinvention as a techno star."

She also \u201chumbly apologised\u201d for criticising him in public and told him she was aware \u201cyou feel hellaciously let down by me\u201d.\n\nDescribing the phone call that prompted the email, Henderson told the Telegraph: \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how terrible Epstein was. I can remember everything about that call.\n\n\u201cIt was a chilling call and I\u2019m surprised anybody was ever friends with him given the way he talked to me.\n\n\u201cHe said he would destroy the York family and he was quite clear on that. He said he would destroy me. He wasn\u2019t shouting. He had a Hannibal Lecter-type voice. It was very cold and calm and really menacing and nasty.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe pressure she was put under to protect her family must have been huge. I am sure there were legal actions.\n\n\u201cAnd this was long before the duke\u2019s life had been ruined by his association with Epstein. It was 14 years ago and everyone will do what they have to do to protect their family. Her family and children will always come first for her.\u201d\n\nHenderson has been contacted for comment.\n\nFerguson had told the Evening Standard in her 2011 interview: \u201cI abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know that this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf. I am just so contrite I cannot say. Whenever I can, I will repay the money and have nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again.\u201d\n\nAmong the organisations to end their relationships with the duchess after the 2011 email came to light this week was the Teenage Cancer Trust, which dropped her as patron after 35 years.\n\nSimilar announcements came from the Wiltshire and Dorset-based children\u2019s hospice Julia\u2019s House, Prevent Breast Cancer, the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation and the National Foundation for Retired Service Animals, which all cut ties with the duchess on Monday. The British Heart Foundation also said Ferguson was no longer a serving ambassador for the charity.\n\nEpstein was found dead in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan, in the US, in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges. The death was ruled a suicide."

She's kept bouncing back. Last Christmas she was praised by royal insiders for helping to keep Prince Andrew away from public events when he was caught up in a Chinese spy scandal.\n\nThe Christmas before she had been back in the royal fold, joining a royal Christmas gathering in Sandringham for the first time in decades. That was despite the Duke and Duchess of York not being working royals or allowed to be part of official royal events.\n\nBut this latest scandal is going to raise difficult questions about any future return - and Buckingham Palace might want the duke and duchess to keep their distance.\n\nSign up here to get the latest royal stories and analysis every week with our Royal Watch newsletter.

Normally, we'd be discussing your work, your duty and we'll come on to that but today you've chosen to speak out for the first time. Why have you decided to talk now?\n\nPrince Andrew: Because there is no good time to talk about Mr Epstein and all things associated and we've been talking to Newsnight for about six months about doing something around the work that I was doing and unfortunately we've just not been able to fit it into either your schedule or my schedule until now. And actually it's a very good opportunity and I'm delighted to be able to see you today.\n\nEM: As you say, all of this goes back to your friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, how did you first become friends? How did you meet?\n\nPA: Well I met through his girlfriend back in 1999 who\u2026 and I'd known her since she was at university in the UK and it would be, to some extent, a stretch to say that as it were we were close friends. I mean we were friends because of other people and I had a lot of opportunity to go to the United States but I didn't have much time with him.\n\nI suppose I saw him once or twice a year, perhaps maybe maximum of three times a year and quite often if I was in the United States and doing things and if he wasn't there, he would say \"well, why don't you come and use my houses?\" so I said \"that's very kind, thank you very much indeed\".\n\nBut it would be a considerable stretch to say that he was a very, very close friend. But he had the most extraordinary ability to bring extraordinary people together and that's the bit that I remember as going to the dinner parties where you would meet academics, politicians, people from the United Nations, I mean it was a cosmopolitan group of what I would describe as US eminents.\n\nEM: Was that his appeal then?\n\nPA: Yeah.\n\nEM: Was that what you\u2026 because you were perceived by the public as being the party prince, was that something you shared?\n\nPA: Well, I think that's also a bit of a stretch. I don't know why I've collected that title because I don't\u2026 I never have really partied. I was single for quite a long time in the early 80s but then after I got married I was very happy and I've never really felt the need to go and party and certainly going to Jeffrey's was not about partying, absolutely not.\n\nEM: In 2008 he was convicted of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution, he was jailed, this was your friend, how did you feel about it?\n\nPA: Well I ceased contact with him after I was aware that he was under investigation and that was later in 2006 and I wasn't in touch with him again until 2010. So just it was one of those things that somebody's going through that sort of thing well I'm terribly sorry I can't be\u2026 see you.\n\nEM: So no contact?\n\nPA: No contact.\n\nEM: When he was serving time there was no call, no letter, nothing there?\n\nPA: No, no, no.\n\nEM: He was released in July, within months by December of 2010 you went to stay with him at his New York mansion, why? Why were you staying with a convicted sex offender?\n\nPA: Right, I have always\u2026 ever since this has happened and since this has become, as it were, public knowledge that I was there, I've questioned myself as to why did I go and what was I doing and was it the right thing to do? Now, I went there with the sole purpose of saying to him that because he had been convicted, it was inappropriate for us to be seen together.\n\nAnd I had a number of people counsel me in both directions, either to go and see him or not to go and see him and I took the judgement call that because this was serious and I felt that doing it over the telephone was the chicken's way of doing it. I had to go and see him and talk to him.\n\nAnd I went to see him and I was doing a number of other things in New York at the time and we had an opportunity to go for a walk in the park and that was the conversation coincidentally that was photographed which was when I said to him, I said, \"Look, because of what has happened, I don't think it is appropriate that we should remain in contact,\" and by mutual agreement during that walk in the park we decided that we would part company and I left, I think it was the next day and to this day I never had any contact with him from that day forward.\n\nEM: What did he say when you told him that you were breaking up the friendship?\n\nPA: He was what I would describe as understanding, he didn't go into any great depth in the conversation about what I was\u2026 what he was doing, except to say that he'd accepted, whatever it was, a plea bargain, he'd served his time and he was carrying on with his life if you see what I mean and I said, \"Yes but I'm afraid to say that that's as maybe but with all the attendant scrutiny on me then I don't think it is a wise thing to do.\"\n\nEM: Who advised you then that it was a good idea to go and break up the friendship? Did that come from the palace, was Her Majesty, the Queen involved?\n\nPA: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that came from\u2026 so there were a number of people who\u2026 so some people from my staff, some people from friends and family I was talking to and I took the decision that it was I had to show leadership and I had to go and see him and I had to tell him, \"That's it.\"\n\nEM: That was December of 2010.\n\nPA: Yep.\n\nEM: He threw a party to celebrate his release and you were invited as the guest of honour.\n\nPA: No, I didn't go. Oh, in 2010, there certainly wasn't a party to celebrate his release in December because it was a small dinner party, there were only eight or 10 of us I think at the dinner. If there was a party then I'd know nothing about that.\n\nEM: You were invited to that dinner as a guest of honour.\n\nPA: Well I was there so there was a dinner, I don't think it was quite as you might put it but yeah, OK I was there for\u2026 I was there at a dinner, yeah.\n\nEM: I'm just trying to work this out because you said you went to break up the relationship and yet you stayed at that New York mansion several days. I'm wondering how long?\n\nPA: But I was doing a number of other things while I was there.\n\nEM: But you were staying at the house\u2026\n\nPA: Yes.\n\nEM: \u2026 of a convicted sex offender.\n\nPA: It was a convenient place to stay. I mean I've gone through this in my mind so many times. At the end of the day, with a benefit of all the hindsight that one can have, it was definitely the wrong thing to do. But at the time I felt it was the honourable and right thing to do and I admit fully that my judgement was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable but that's just the way it is.\n\nEM: Because during that time, those few days, witnesses say they saw many young girls coming and going at the time. There is video footage of Epstein accompanied by young girls and you were there staying in his house, catching up with friends.\n\nPA: I never\u2026 I mean if there were then I wasn't a party to any of that. I never saw them. I mean you have to understand that his house, I described it more as almost as a railway station if you know what I mean in the sense that there were people coming in and out of that house all the time.\n\nWhat they were doing and why they were there I had nothing to do with. So I'm afraid I can't make any comment on that because I really don't know.\n\nEM: Another guest was John Brockman, the literary agent. Now, he described seeing you there getting a foot massage from a young Russian woman, did that happen?\n\nPA: No.\n\nEM: You're absolutely sure or you can't remember?\n\nPA: Yeah, I'm absolutely sure.\n\nEM: So John Brockman's statement is false?\n\nPA: I wouldn't\u2026 I wouldn't\u2026 I don't know Mr Brockman so I don't know what he's talking about.\n\nEM: But that definitely wasn't you getting a foot massage from a Russian girl in Jeffrey Epstein's house?\n\nPA: No.\n\nEM: It might seem a funny way to break off a friendship, a four-day house party of sorts with a dinner. It's an odd way to break up a friendship.\n\nPA: It's a difficult way of put\u2026 that's a very stark way of putting it, yes you're absolutely right. But actually the truth of it is is that I actually only saw him for about, what the dinner party, the walk in the park and probably passing in the passage.\n\nEM: Let's go to that Central Park walk which was snapped. Friends of yours suggest that Epstein wanted that photo taken, perhaps he'd even set it up, do you worry that you were being played?\n\nPA: Again, new information is coming out since his suicide has made us reappraise that walk in the park. We can't find any evidence or my staff and my people and I can't find any evidence to suggest that that was what he was doing. I mean you can look at it in so many different ways. The fact of the matter is is that somebody very cleverly took that photograph, it wasn't as far as I remember nor do my security people remember, anybody being present or close because there were enough security around.\n\nI mean there are even photographs of the security people who are around in the photograph. So I mean he could have done but\u2026\n\nEM: Yeah, I guess what I'm asking is do you feel that you were part of Epstein's public rehabilitation?\n\nPA: Oh no, funnily enough I don't, no. I mean if he was\u2026 if he was doing\u2026 if that photograph was taken with that purpose in mind, then it doesn't\u2026 it doesn't equate to what actually happened.\n\nEM: So why wouldn't you announce this break up when you got that? Why wouldn't you publicly explain what you've done? Did you worry that he had something that could compromise you?\n\nPA: No, no.\n\nEM: Do you regret that trip?\n\nPA: Yes.\n\nEM: Do you regret the whole friendship with Epstein?\n\nPA: Now, still not and the reason being is that the people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn either by him or because of him were actually very useful. He himself not, as it were, as close as you might think, we weren't that close. So therefore I mean yes I would go and stay in his house but that was because of his girlfriend, not because of him.\n\nEM: Was that visit, December of 2010 the only time you saw him after he was convicted?\n\nPA: Yes, yeah.\n\nEM: Did you see him or speak to him again?\n\nPA: No.\n\nEM: Never since then?\n\nPA: No, that was\u2026 funny enough, 2010 was it, that was it because I went\u2026 well first of all I wanted to make sure that if I was going to go and see him, I had to make sure that there was enough time between his release because it wasn't something that I was going into in a hurry but I had to go and see him, I had to go and see him, I had to talk.\n\nEM: And stay with him, and stay in the house of a convicted sex offender?\n\nPA: I could easily have gone and stayed somewhere else but sheer convenience of being able to get a hold of the man was\u2026 I mean he was in and out all over the place. So getting him in one place for a period of time to actually have a long enough conversation to say look, these are the reasons why I'm not going to\u2026 and that happened on the walk.\n\nEM: July of this year, Epstein was arrested on charges of sex trafficking and abusing dozens of underage girls. One of the Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts\u2026\n\nPA: Yeah.\n\nEM: \u2026 has made allegations against you. She says she met you in 2001, she says she dined with you, danced with you at Tramp Nightclub in London. She went on to have sex with you in a house in Belgravia belonging to Ghislaine Maxwell, your friend. Your response?\n\nPA: I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\n\nEM: You don't remember meeting her?\n\nPA: No.\n\nEM: She says she met you in 2001, she dined with you, she danced with you, you bought her drinks, you were in Tramp Nightclub in London and she went on to have sex with you in a house in Belgravia belonging to Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nPA: It didn't happen.\n\nEM: Do you remember her?\n\nPA: No, I've no recollection of ever meeting her, I'm almost, in fact I'm convinced that I was never in Tramps with her. There are a number of things that are wrong with that story, one of which is that I don't know where the bar is in Tramps. I don't drink, I don't think I've ever bought a drink in Tramps whenever I was there.\n\nEM: Do you remember dancing at Tramp?\n\nPA: No, that couldn't have happened because the date that's being suggested I was at home with the children.\n\nEM: You know that you were at home with the children, was it a memorable night?\n\nPA: On that particular day that we now understand is the date which is the 10th of March, I was at home, I was with the children and I'd taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking for a party at I suppose sort of 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon. And then because the duchess was away, we have a simple rule in the family that when one is away the other one is there. I was on terminal leave at the time from the Royal Navy so therefore I was at home.\n\nEM: Why would you remember that so specifically? Why would you remember a Pizza Express birthday and being at home?\n\nPA: Because going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do, a very unusual thing for me to do. I've never been\u2026 I've only been to Woking a couple of times and I remember it weirdly distinctly. As soon as somebody reminded me of it, I went, \"Oh yes, I remember that.\" But I have no recollection of ever meeting or being in the company or the presence.\n\nEM: So you're absolutely sure that you were at home on the 10th March?\n\nPA: Yeah.\n\nEM: She was very specific about that night, she described dancing with you.\n\nPA: No.\n\nEM: And you profusely sweating and that she went on to have bath possibly.\n\nPA: There's a slight problem with the sweating because I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don't sweat or I didn't sweat at the time and that was\u2026 was it\u2026 yes, I didn't sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenalin in the Falkland's War when I was shot at and I simply\u2026 it was almost impossible for me to sweat. And it's only because I have done a number of things in the recent past that I am starting to be able to do that again. So I'm afraid to say that there's a medical condition that says that I didn't do it so therefore\u2026\n\nEM: Is it possible that you met Virginia Roberts, dined with her, danced with her in Tramp, had sex with her on another date?\n\nPA: No.\n\nEM: Do you remember meeting her at all?\n\nPA: No.\n\nEM: Do you know you didn't meet her or do you just not remember meeting her?\n\nPA: No, I have\u2026 I don't know if I've met her but no, I have no recollection of meeting her.\n\nEM: Because she was very specific, she described the dance that you had together in Tramp. She described meeting you, she was a 17-year-old girl meeting a senior member of the Royal Family.\n\nPA: It never happened.\n\nEM: She provided a photo of the two of you together.\n\nPA: Yes, yes.\n\nEM: Your arm was around her waist.\n\nPA: Yes.\n\nEM: You've seen the photo.\n\nPA: I've seen the photograph.\n\nEM: How do you explain that?\n\nPA: I can't because I don't\u2026 I have no\u2026 again I have absolutely no memory of that photograph ever being taken.\n\nEM: Do you recognise yourself in the photo?\n\nPA: Yes, it's pretty difficult not to recognise yourself.\n\nEM: Your friends suggested that the photo is fake.\n\nPA: I think it's\u2026 from the investigations that we've done, you can't prove whether or not that photograph is faked or not because it is a photograph of a photograph of a photograph. So it's very difficult to be able to prove it but I don't remember that photograph ever being taken.\n\nEM: But it's possible that it was you with your arm around her waist?\n\nPA: That's me but whether that's my hand or whether that's the position I\u2026 but I don't\u2026 I have simply no recollection of the photograph ever being taken.\n\nEM: The world has now seen the photo that Virginia Roberts provided taken by Epstein we understand in Ghislaine Maxwell's house.\n\nPA: Well here's the problem, I've never seen Epstein with a camera in my life.\n\nEM: I think it was Virginia Roberts's camera, she said a little Kodak one that she lent to Epstein, he took a photo and your arm is round her waist.\n\nPA: Listen, I don't remember, I don't remember that photograph ever being taken. I don't remember going upstairs in the house because that photograph was taken upstairs and I am not entirely convinced that\u2026 I mean that is\u2026 that is what I would describe as me in that\u2026 in that picture but I can't\u2026 we can't be certain as to whether or not that's my hand on her whatever it is, left\u2026 left side.\n\nEM: You think that\u2026\n\nPA: Because I have no recollection of that photograph ever being taken.\n\nEM: So why would somebody have put in another hand? You think it is next to her in the photo.\n\nPA: Oh it's definitely me, I mean that's a picture of me, it's not a picture of\u2026 I don't believe it's a picture of me in London because when I would go out to\u2026 when I go out in London, I wear a suit and a tie. That's what I would describe as\u2026 those are my travelling clothes if I'm going to go\u2026 if I'm going overseas. There's a\u2026 I've got plenty of photographs of me dressed in those sorts of\u2026 that sort of kit but not there.\n\nEM: Just to clarify sorry, you think that photo has been faked?\n\nPA: Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken.\n\nEM: And you don't recollect having your hand\u2026\n\nPA: No.\n\nEM: \u2026 round her waist in Ghislaine Maxwell's house on any occasion, even if it was a different date?\n\nPA: I'm terribly sorry but if I, as a member of the Royal Family, and I have a photograph taken and I take very, very few photographs, I am not one to, as it were, hug and public displays of affection are not something that I do. So that's the best explanation I can give you and I'm afraid to say that I don't believe that photograph was taken in the way that has been suggested.\n\nEM: Why would people not believe that you were there?\n\nPA: I'm sorry, why would?\n\nEM: I'm just trying to understand, there's a photo inside Ghislaine Maxwell's house, Ghislaine herself in the background, why would people not believe that you were there with her that night?\n\nPA: They might well wish to believe it but the photograph is taken upstairs and I don't think I ever went upstairs in Ghislaine's house.\n\nEM: Are you sure of that?\n\nPA: Yeah, because the dining room and everything was on the ground floor, was as you came in\u2026 as you came in the hall. So I don't remember ever going up there. I'm at a loss to explain this particular photograph. If the original was ever produced, then perhaps we might be able to solve it but I can't.\n\nEM: But you can say categorically that you don't recall meeting Virginia Roberts, dining with her?\n\nPA: Yep.\n\nEM: Dancing with her at Tramp?\n\nPA: Yep.\n\nEM: Or going on to have sex with her\u2026\n\nPA: Yes.\n\nEM: \u2026in a bedroom in a house in Belgravia?\n\nPA: I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened.\n\nEM: Do you recall any kind of sexual contact with Virginia Roberts then or any other time?\n\nPA: None whatsoever.\n\nEM: Because she said in a legal deposition, a legal court document in 2015, she had sex with you three times. She is not confused about this. She said the first was in London when she was trafficked to you, the second was at Epstein's mansion in New York.\n\nPA: That is a date in April I believe, is that correct?\n\nEM: She said it was a month or so later.\n\nPA: Yeah, well I think that the date we have for that shows that I was in Boston or I was in New York the previous day and I was at a dinner for The Outward Bound Trust in New York and then I flew up to Boston the following day and then on the day that she says that this occurred, they'd already left to go the island before I got back from Boston. So I don't think that could have happened at all.\n\nEM: There was a witness there, Johanna Sjoberg who says that you did visit the house in that month.\n\nPA: I probably did, on one of the weirder things, I was staying with the\u2026 because of what I was doing I was staying with the Consul General which is further down the street on the 5th so I wasn't\u2026 I wasn't staying there. I may have visited but no, definitely didn't, definitely, definitely no, no, no activity.\n\nEM: Because in a legal deposition 2015, she said she had sex with you three times. Once in a London house when she was trafficked to you in Maxwell's house.\n\nPA: Yes.\n\nEM: Once in New York a month or so later at Epstein's mansion and once on his private island in a group of seven or eight other girls.\n\nPA: No.\n\nEM: No to all of those?\n\nPA: All of it, absolutely no to all of it.\n\nEM: Why would she be saying those things?\n\nPA: We wonder exactly the same but I have no idea, absolutely no idea.\n\nEM: She made these claims in a US deposition.\n\nPA: Hmm mmm.\n\nEM: Are you saying you don't believe her, she's lying?\n\nPA: That's a very difficult thing to answer because I'm not in a position to know what she's trying to achieve but I can tell you categorically I don't remember meeting her at all. I do not remember a photograph being taken and I've said consistently and frequently that we never had any sort of sexual contact whatever.\n\nEM: She spoke about you outside the court in August of this year? She said, I quote, \"He knows exactly what he's done and I hope he comes clean about it.\"\n\nPA: And the answer is nothing.\n\nEM: So if Virginia Roberts is watching this interview, what is your message to her?\n\nPA: I don't have a message for her because I have to have a thick skin. If somebody is going to make those sorts of allegations then I've got to have a thick skin and get on with it but they never happened.\n\nEM: For the record, is there any way you could have had sex with that young woman or any young woman trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein in any of his residences?\n\nPA: No and without putting too fine a point on it, if you're a man it is a positive act to have sex with somebody. You have to have to take some sort of positive action and so therefore if you try to forget it's very difficult to try and forget a positive action and I do not remember anything. I can't, I've wracked my brain and thinking oh\u2026 when the first allegations, when the allegations came out originally I went well that's a bit strange, I don't remember this and then I've been through it and through it and through it over and over and over again and no, nothing. It just never happened.\n\nEM: Epstein's housekeeper also in a Florida Court legal deposition said that you visited the Palm Beach residence around four times a year, you got a daily massage.\n\nPA: Four times a year?\n\nEM: That was what he said in a Florida Court legal deposition.\n\nPA: No.\n\nEM: I'm just wondering when you look back now, is there a chance that those massages might have been the services of someone who is being sexually exploited or trafficked by Epstein?\n\nPA: No, I don't think\u2026 I mean I\u2026 no, definitely not, definitely not and I definitely did not visit his Palm Beach house three of four times a year, absolutely not.\n\nEM: How many times would you say you visited?\n\nPA: In total, probably four times in total throughout the time that I knew him. In fact probably that was the place that\u2026 if you see what I mean, he was in the house more there than in other\u2026 in other places that I was at.\n\nEM: So that's where you'd find him?\n\nPA: But it was usually because I was going\u2026 I was going through and on somewhere else so it was a day, that was it.\n\nEM: You said in your statement from the palace, at no time did I see, witness or suspect any suspicious behaviour.\n\nPA: Yeah, yeah.\n\nEM: Virginia Roberts's legal team says, \"You could not spend time around Epstein and not know what was going on. You could not spend time around Epstein and not know what was going on.\"\n\nPA: If you are somebody like me then people behave in a subtly different way. You wouldn't\u2026 first of all I'm not looking for it, that's the thing, you see, if you're looking for it, then you might have suspected now with the benefit of a huge amount of hindsight and a huge amount of analysis, you look back and you go well was that really the way that it was or was I looking at it the very wrong way? But you don't go into these places, you don't go to stay with people looking for that.\n\nEM: \"You could not spend time around him,\" that was what they said, \"You could not spend time around him and not know\".\n\nPA: The other aspect of this is that\u2026 is that I live in an institution at Buckingham Palace which has members of staff walking around all the time and I don't wish to appear grand but there were a lot of people who were walking around Jeffrey Epstein's house. As far as I was aware, they were staff, they were people that were working for him, doing things, I\u2026 as it were, I interacted with them if you will to say good morning, good afternoon but I didn't, if you see what I mean, interact with them in a way that was, you know what are you doing here, why are you here, what's going on?\n\nEM: But you'd notice if there were hundreds of underage girls in Buckingham Palace wouldn't you?\n\nPA: Oh God, but sorry you would notice if there were hundreds of underage girls in Jeffrey's house. Wasn't there, not when I was there. Now he may have changed his behaviour patterns in order for that not to be obvious to me so I don't\u2026 I mean this is\u2026 you're asking me to speculate on things that I just don't know about.\n\nEM: You seem utterly convinced you're telling the truth, would you be willing to testify or give a statement under oath if you were asked?\n\nPA: Well I'm like everybody else and I will have to take all the legal advice that there was before I was to do that sort of thing. But if push came to shove and the legal advice was to do so, then I would be duty bound to do so.\n\nEM: Because you've said there are many unanswered questions, everyone affected wants closure, you would help to provide that closure.\n\nPA: If there was\u2026 in the right circumstances, yes I would because I think there's just as much closure for me as there is for everybody else and undoubtedly some very strange and unpleasant activities have been going on. I'm afraid to say that I'm not the person who can shed light on it for a number of reasons, one of which is that I wasn't there long enough.\n\nAnd if you go in for a day, two days at a time, it's quite easy I'm led to believe for those sorts of people to hide their activities for that period of time and then carry on when they're not there.\n\nEM: Virginia Roberts's lawyers, legal team say that they've asked for a legal statement from you. There is an active FBI investigation, would you be willing to provide that?\n\nPA: Again, I'm bound by what my legal advice is\u2026 legal advisers tell me.\n\nEM: Epstein was found dead.\n\nPA: Yep.\n\nEM: In prison.\n\nPA: Yes.\n\nEM: In August of this year.\n\nPA: Yep.\n\nEM: What was your response on hearing that he'd died?\n\nPA: Shock.\n\nEM: Some people think that he didn't take his own life.\n\nPA: There again, I'm not one to be able to answer that question. I believe that centres around something to do with a bone in his neck so whether or not if you commit suicide that bone breaks or something. But I'm afraid to say I'm not an expert, I have to take what the coroner says and he has ruled that it was suicide so\u2026\n\nEM: He's dead, his girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, your old friend was, victims say, complicit in his behaviour.\n\nPA: That bit I can't help you with because I've no idea.\n\nEM: Do you think that she has questions to answer about her role in this?\n\nPA: In the same way that I have questions to answer in the sense of what was I doing and as I say that I was there to\u2026 to my mind be honourable and say to him, \"Look, you've been convicted, it would be incompatible for me to be seen with you,\" but unfortunately somebody was standing around with a camera at the time and got a photograph of us. It's one of the very few photographs there are of us but that was\u2026 that was the case.\n\nIf there are questions that Ghislaine has to answer, that's her problem I'm afraid, I'm not in a position to be able to comment one way or the other.\n\nEM: When was your last contact with her?\n\nPA: It was earlier this year funnily enough in the summer, in the spring, summer.\n\nEM: About what?\n\nPA: She was here doing some rally.\n\nEM: So even though he had by then been arrested and was facing charges of sex trafficking?\n\nPA: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, this was\u2026 this was early spring I think, it was long\u2026 because when was he arrested?\n\nEM: July.\n\nPA: No, it was before July.\n\nEM: And that was the last time?\n\nPA: Yeah, yeah.\n\nEM: Did you discuss Epstein at all?\n\nPA: No, actually funnily enough no not at all, there wasn't anything to discuss about him because he wasn't in the news, you know, it was just\u2026 we had moved on.\n\nEM: I want to talk about moving on now.\n\nPA: Oh yeah, right, okay.\n\nEM: Epstein is dead.\n\nPA: Yes.\n\nEM: The women are now being heard.\n\nPA: Quite rightly.\n\nEM: How do you move on from this?\n\nPA: Well, it's an interesting way of putting it. I'm carrying on with what I do. I have a number of things that I have been doing since 2011, they're pretty well organised, pretty successful and so I'm carrying on and trying to improve those things that I'm already doing.\n\nEM: I wonder what effect all this has had on your close family? You've got your daughters of your own.\n\nPA: It has been, what I would describe as a constant sore in the family. We all knew him and I think that if we have a conversation about it, it's\u2026 we are all left with the same thing, what on earth happened or how did he get to where he was, what did he do, how did he do it?\n\nAnd so it's just a constant sort of gnaw. I mean this first came out in 2011 and it was a surprise to\u2026 to all of us because the photographs were published at a separate time to when I was there and then we sort of questioned what on earth is going on and as a family we discussed it.\n\nAnd then in 2015 when the allegations were made in the deposition, there was a sort of\u2026 there was a sort of\u2026 this is the immediate family, not the wider family. The wider family couldn't be more supportive but the immediate family, it was well, what's all this about? And we all just were at a loss so it's just\u2026\n\nEM: Has the episode been damaging to the Royal Family, to Her Majesty the Queen?\n\nPA: I don't believe it's been damaging to the Queen at all, it has to me and it's been a constant drip if you see what I mean in the background that people want to know. If I was in a position to be able to answer all these questions in a way that gave sensible answers other than the ones that I have given that gave closure then I'd love it but I'm afraid I can't. I'm just not in a position to do so because I'm just as much in the dark as many people.\n\nEM: How do you reconnect with the public then now?\n\nPA: Exactly what I'm doing which is to use and to continue to work with Pitch, to continue to work with iDEA and the things that I believe strongly in. I'm not somebody who does things in competition with people oddly. I do things in collaboration with people.\n\nSo I want people to\u2026 to work together to come to, as it were, a solution to a bigger problem. And so I got a number of people working together, particularly in the education field, particularly in\u2026 and also in areas of government and what they are doing so that we're bringing everybody together so that we're all pushing in the same direction and iDEA now does that.\n\nWe've been going properly now for two years, we've got 3.5 million people who got a badge. We've got half a million, or just over half a million young people are using the service and I'm trying to think what else we've got. But it's\u2026 well it's designed for seven to 14-year-olds in the United Kingdom and it turns out it's done from 5 to 95 around the world so it's being done in 100 countries now. So we're slightly on the catch-up at this point.\n\nEM: I know we have to bring this to a close because we're running out of time. You've faced questions today on a very, very raw subject. There has never been an interview like this before, I wonder what that tells us about the way the Royal Family now confronts these difficult situations. Has there been a sea change?\n\nPA: I think the problem that I'm\u2026 we face in the 21st Century is social media. There is a whole range of things that you face now that you didn't face 25 years ago because it was just the print media. And I think that to some extent there is a\u2026 there is a thick skin that you have to have and again I'm not a confrontationist myself.\n\nI would prefer to be able to, as it were, resolve things in a way that is sensible. And so choosing to, as it were, get out there and talk about these things, it's almost\u2026 it's almost a mental health issue to some extent for me in the sense that it's been nagging at my mind for a great many years. I know that I made the wrong judgement and I made the wrong decision but I made the wrong decision and the wrong judgement I believe fundamentally for the right reasons which is to say to somebody \"I'm not going to see you again\" and in fact from that day forth, I was never in contact with him.\n\nThe subsequent allegations are, what I would describe as surprising, shocking and a distraction. But that's\u2026 I mean there are all sorts of things that are on the internet and out there in the public domain that we just sort of go, \"Well, yeah,\" but I'm afraid is\u2026 it just never happened.\n\nEM: You've talked about a thick skin, I wonder if you have any sense now of guilt, regret or shame about any of your behaviour and your friendship with Epstein?\n\nPA: As far as Mr Epstein was concerned, it was the wrong decision to go and see him in 2010. As far as my association with him was concerned, it had some seriously beneficial outcomes in areas that have nothing and have nothing to do with what I would describe as what we're talking about today.\n\nOn balance, could I have avoided ever meeting him? Probably not and that's because of my friendship with Ghislaine, it was\u2026 it was\u2026 it was inevitable that we would have come across each other. Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes.\n\nEM: Unbecoming? He was a sex offender.\n\nPA: Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm being polite, I mean in the sense that he was a sex offender. But no, was I right in having him as a friend? At the time, bearing in mind this was some years before he was accused of being a sex offender. I don't there was anything wrong then, the problem was the fact that once he had been convicted\u2026\n\nEM: You stayed with him.\n\nPA: I stayed with him and that's\u2026 that's\u2026 that's the bit that\u2026 that\u2026 that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the Royal Family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that.\n\nEM: This interview has been exceptionally rare, you might not speak on this subject again, is there anything you feel has been left unsaid that you would like to say now?\n\nPA: No, I don't think so. I think you've probably dragged out most of what is required and I'm truly grateful for the opportunity that you've given me to be able to discuss this with you.\n\nEM: Your Royal Highness, thank you.\n\nPA: Thank you very much indeed.\n\nPrince Andrew & the Epstein Scandal: The Newsnight Interview was shown on BBC Two on 16 November 2019 and can be seen on BBC iPlayer in the UK and the full interview can also be seen on YouTube, external."

                "text": "In March 2021, a 25-year-old US citizen was traveling through Chicago\u2019s Midway airport when they were stopped by US border patrol agents. Though charged with no crime, the 25-year-old was subjected to a cheek swab to collect their DNA, which was sent to the FBI, according to a new report. The unnamed citizen was later admitted into the country. Their DNA was added to the FBI\u2019s database of genetic material despite the lack of criminal charges.\n\nThe 25-year-old is one of about 2,000 US citizens whose DNA was collected between 2020 and 2024 by the Department of Homeland Security and shared with the FBI, researchers from Georgetown\u2019s Center on Privacy and Technology found in an analysis of recently released data from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). CBP officers took genetic material from some citizens as young as 14, according to the report.\n\n\u201cIn a flagrant and alarming abuse of power, the DHS has been regularly collecting DNA from US citizens without legal justification,\u201d said Stevie Glaberson, the director of research and advocacy at Georgetown\u2019s privacy center. \u201cThe lack of checks on DHS\u2019s collection power we think renders the program unconstitutional and violates the fourth amendment.\u201d\n\nOnce immigration authorities collect DNA and share it with the FBI, it is stored in a database called the Combined DNA Index System (Codis), which is used across the country by local, state and federal law enforcement to identify suspects of crimes using their DNA. A May 2024 report, also from Georgetown\u2019s Center on Privacy and Technology, found that CBP had been collecting the DNA information of every migrant detained. Border patrol was also collecting and sharing the DNA information of migrant children, according to the agency\u2019s data. Initial estimates show that the sensitive genetic information of about 133,000 teens and children was being uploaded and stored in this federal criminal database in perpetuity.\n\nThe new CBP documents specifically cover how many US citizens have had their genetic information collected at various ports of entry, including major airports. The agency compiled the data and included the ages of the people whose DNA samples were collected by border agents as well as what charges were being levied against them. Like the 25-year-old, about 40 US citizens had DNA samples taken by CBP and shared with the FBI even though they were charged with no crime. Six of these were minors.\n\nUnder current regulation, CBP is permitted to collect the DNA of any individual \u2013 regardless of citizenship status \u2013 who has been arrested, is facing charges or has been convicted of a crime, as well as non-US citizens who have been detained.\n\nWhat the law does not allow border patrol agents to do, Glaberson asserts, is collect the DNA samples of US citizens simply because they have been detained. But the recently released data shows that CBP does not have a system to check whether there is a lawful reason to collect an individual\u2019s DNA, she said.\n\nIn some unusual cases, US citizens had their DNA swabbed for civil \u2013 not criminal \u2013 infractions such as \u201cfailure to declare\u201d \u2013 which could be as simple as a person not declaring an item they bought abroad. In at least two cases of citizens having their DNA swabbed, the CBP agent simply wrote down \u201cinspection by immigration officer\u201d under charges.\n\n\u201cThis is CBP\u2019s own administrative data,\u201d Glaberson said. \u201cThis is what they\u2019re writing down. What that data shows is pretty chilling. In case after case, CBP agents are pulling US citizens aside and swabbing their mouths without any reason to do so.\u201d\n\nIn about 865 of the nearly 2,000 cases of US citizens having their DNA swabbed by the CBP, no formal federal charges were filed. That means the cases never went before an independent arbiter such as a judge, according to Glaberson.\n\n\u201cNone of these folks necessarily go before a judge to get the legality of detention and arrest reviewed,\u201d she said.\n\nDNA data can reveal incredibly sensitive information, including a person\u2019s genetic relations and information about those relatives \u2013 regardless of their citizenship status. The information, accessible in a criminal database used to investigate suspects of crime, could subject people to investigations that they would otherwise not be swept up in, Glaberson said.\n\n\u201cIf you think that your status as a citizen protects you from of the authoritarian practices, this is proof that it does not and will not,\u201d she said."

In total, law enforcement discovered 300 SIM servers \u2013 over 100,000 SIM cards \u2013 enabling encrypted, anonymous communication and capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute. Officials say the servers were so powerful they could have disabled cell phone towers and launched distributed denial of services attacks with the ability to block emergency communications like EMS and police dispatch.\n\n\"This network had the potential to disable cell phone towers and essentially shut down the cellular network in New York City,\" U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool said in a video released by the agency.\n\nAn official briefed on the investigation told reporters that this week, the sophisticated network \"could text message the entire country within 12 minutes,\" later adding, \"This was well organized and well funded.\"\n\nTelephonic threats to multiple senior U.S. officials this past spring \u2013 including multiple people protected by the Secret Service \u2013 first triggered the investigation, but officials say the network was seized within the last three weeks.\n\n\"We cannot share which officials were targeted out of concerns for their privacy, but as the forensics investigation continues, we do expect that we will find more targeted officials once we get through that data,\" McCool said.\n\nEarly analysis shows the network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals known to U.S. law enforcement, including members of known organized crime gangs, drug cartels and human trafficking rings, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation. The U.S. Secret Service says it is combing through the more than 100,000 SIM cards in an ongoing, exhaustive forensic analysis.\n\n\"Each SIM basically has the equivalent data of a cell phone. So we're working through every call, every text, every search made on those SIM cards,\" an official told CBS News, adding, \"Early analysis indicates that this network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals that are known to federal law enforcement here in the U.S.\"\n\nThe equipment was found within 35 miles of the United Nations in New York, ahead of the U.N. General Assembly. Investigators also found 80 grams of cocaine, illegal firearms, plus computers and phones.\n\n\"This isn't a group of people in a basement playing a video game and trying to play a prank,\" one official said. \"This was well organized and well funded.\"\n\n\"The timing, the location, the proximity of this network had the potential to impact the U.N. and that was clear and something that we had to consider,\" added McCool.\n\nThe investigation was launched by a new division within the U.S. Secret Service established by Director Sean Curran and dubbed the \"Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit,\" in conjunction with Homeland Security Investigations.\n\n\"These devices no longer pose any threat to New York,\" an official said. \"We've taken care of and dismantled that threat\u2026There is currently no credible threat against the UN.\"\n\nStill, another official added that \"it would be unwise to assume\" there aren't other such networks in the U.S.\n\nThe investigation remains ongoing, according to the U.S. Secret Service. There have been no arrests yet, but officials said, \"there could be arrests down the road,\" adding that \"from an operational perspective, we want those behind the network to know that the Secret Service is aware and that we're kind of coming for them.\"\n\nHomeland Security Investigations is leading the criminal investigation into individuals involved in coordinating this large scheme, while the U.S. Secret Service is running down threats tied back to its protectees, according to multiple U.S. officials.\n\nIn a statement released by the U.S. Secret Service, the agency also thanked the Department of Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the NYPD, as well as other state and local law enforcement partners, for providing technical advice and assistance."

Rick Scott\u2019s home in Florida was swatted.\n\nThe wave of false alarms about shootings and violence continued to assail high-level government officials: the federal judge overseeing Trump\u2019s election subversion case, then-Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, Maine\u2019s Democratic secretary of state.\n\nWithin a month of Donald Trump clinching his second presidential election win, several of his Cabinet picks and administration appointees also were targeted with threats, including calls about bombs and swatting, his transition team said.\n\nThe threats weren\u2019t legitimate. There were no shootings, no violence.\n\nStill, the surge of swatting calls against high-ranking officials posed a real and \u201cimminent threat\u201d to the Secret Service\u2019s prote ctive operations, said Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the agency\u2019s New York field office.\n\nSo, a fledgling unit of the service set out six months ago to unmask the layers of burner phones, changing phone numbers and SIM cards swatting American officials.\n\nThe Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit, along with a flurry of other law enforcement agencies \u2013 the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the New York Police Department, and other state and local law enforcement \u2013 began unraveling the web.\n\nWhat they found was an operation apparently capable of chaos far beyond masking swatting calls to potentially disabling cell phone towers, disrupting emergency services and enabling spies, hackers and organized crime.\n\nThe new unit traced the swatting signals to an apartment just outside New York City.\n\nThey found another rented space.\n\nThen, more.\n\nNo one was inside.\n\nInstead, they found a vast and stunning network of more than 100,000 SIM cards and 300 SIM servers \u2013 the largest seizure ever of such devices by the Secret Service \u2013 all concentrated within 35 miles of New York City.\n\nThe servers could be commanded remotely to create massive amounts of phone traffic in a stealthy and unceasing operation that switched out SIM cards quickly to keep federal law enforcement off its trail.\n\nThe hidden electronic maze was so powerful, it could have sent an encrypted and anonymous text to every human being in the United States within 12 minutes, McCool said. It could have overwhelmed cell towers, toppling New York City\u2019s cell service and preventing every Manhattan resident from accessing Google Maps.\n\nThe electronic safe houses were found in places including Armonk, New York; Greenwich, Connecticut; Queens, New York; and across the river in New Jersey \u2013 essentially forming a circle around New York City\u2019s cellular network infrastructure, officials briefed on the investigation said.\n\nThe Secret Service hasn\u2019t announced any arrests connected to the operation. But its early forensic analysis suggests foreign governments and criminals in the US have used the network to run their organizations, McCool said.\n\n\u201cThat includes cartels, that includes human traffickers, that includes terrorists,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIt is absolutely well funded and well-organized.\u201d\n\nThe network has been taken down and is no longer a threat to New York, law enforcement officials said.\n\nBut, McCool cautioned, \u201cIt would be unwise to think that there\u2019s not other networks across the country.\u201d\n\nThe Secret Service unit is now working to identify other similar networks, he said.\n\n\u201cThe potential for disruption to our country\u2019s telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated,\u201d US Secret Service Director Sean Curran said.\n\nWireless service provider MobileX, whose SIM cards are featured in photographs of items seized in the investigation, said it was \u201cfully prepared to cooperate with the authorities should they reach out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are aware of recent reports that MobileX SIM cards, along with those of other providers, were recovered during a federal investigation,\u201d MobileX founder and CEO Peter Adderton said in a statement. \u201cOur platform is designed to be easy to use and cost-effective, qualities that unfortunately can also attract occasional bad actors.

There was no progress at all,\u201d Kelsey said.\n\n\u201cEventually, he just never crawled,\u201d she added. Instead, he mastered \u201cbutt scooting\u201d to get around their South Amboy home.\n\nAt 18 months, things took a turn. Suddenly, Jack couldn\u2019t put weight on his legs, let alone walk.\n\n\u201cI used to call him spaghetti man because when we\u2019d try to get him to stand, his legs just collapsed,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we grew concerned.\u201d\n\nHope and despair\n\nThe family was referred to a neurologist for genetic testing \u2014 but the lab lost Jack\u2019s samples. For six long months, the Drurys were left in limbo.\n\n\u201cSome days filled with hope, others with really dark thoughts,\u201d said Tim Drury, Jack\u2019s father.\n\nOn July 1, a month after Jack turned 2, they got the diagnosis: infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD).\n\nINAD is a rare genetic disorder that causes fat-like substances to accumulate on the nerves, disrupting signals and slowly stripping children of muscle control, vision, speech and cognitive abilities.\n\nFor a child to have INAD, both parents must pass on a copy of the faulty PLA2G6 gene. Carrier screening is available, but the process can be complex because INAD is so infrequent.\n\nThere is no known cure or treatment to slow the disease. Fewer than 250 kids worldwide have been diagnosed, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders.\n\nThe diagnosis was crushing \u2014 a disease so rare, even their own doctors were stumped.\n\n\u201cNot only did we not know about it, but the neurologist who shared the genetic results with us admitted she hadn\u2019t heard of it before,\u201d Tim, 37, said.\n\nTheir pediatrician and therapists were just as clueless. But one doctor had heard about the INADcure Foundation and pointed the Drurys in that direction.\n\n\u201cIt turns out, out of all the places in the world, the only foundation looking toward a potential treatment \u2014 and aiming for a cure \u2014 is based right here in New Jersey,\u201d Tim said.\n\nFor years, the nonprofit has worked with scientists to develop a gene therapy designed to deliver a healthy copy of the PLA2G6 gene \u2014 the one affected by INAD \u2014 to the cells that need it.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to address the root cause of INAD, with the hope of slowing or stabilizing disease progression,\u201d Leena Panwala, the foundation\u2019s founder and president, told The Post.\n\nBy the time the Drurys connected with the organization, preclinical trials in mice had shown promising results.\n\n\u201cThose that received the treatment did well, had longer lifespans and showed more motor function compared to the mice that didn\u2019t,\u201d said Dr. Darius Adams, a clinical and biochemical geneticist on the foundation\u2019s Scientific Medical Advisory Board.\n\nThe nonprofit signed a deal with a drug manufacturer to produce the treatment, with Adams expressing \u201ccautious optimism.\u201d\n\nFacing the unknown\n\nOne major hurdle remained: The foundation needed $450,000 to pay the manufacturer before the gene therapy could be released.\n\nThe Drurys funneled their emotions into action.\n\nThe family launched Jack\u2019s Miracle Mission, sharing their story in a heartfelt video online. Kelsey expected them to receive a trickle of donations \u2014 not a tidal wave.\n\n\u201cIt took us six days to close the gap on the $450,000,\u201d Tim said.\n\nWhat started as gifts from family and friends quickly snowballed into support from the community and even celebrities like \u201cReal Housewives of New Jersey\u201d star Danielle Cabral and Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi of \u201cJersey Shore\u201d fame.\n\nThe INADcure Foundation is waiting on FDA approval to launch the clinical trial, with enrollment set to begin as soon as it gets the green light.\n\n\u201cThey have a goal to start this early next year,\u201d Tim said.\n\nBut with just 10 spots available, his son\u2019s place isn\u2019t guaranteed.\n\n\u201cJack is one of the younger participants globally that they\u2019re aware of, so I think there\u2019s certainly potential that he\u2019ll be part of this study,\u201d Tim said.\n\nThe treatment will cost about $200,000 per child. Jack\u2019s Miracle Mission is working to raise $2 million to cover the full cost of the trial.\n\n\u201cFor children like Jack, knowing that this is a degenerative disease, they will lose skills and they\u2019ll never get them back,\u201d Tim said, noting that Jack can no longer scoot and is now struggling to hold his bottle and feed himself.\n\n\u201cWe need therapy for Jack to start as soon as possible,\u201d Tim stressed.\n\nWhile the treatment isn\u2019t a cure, it could buy patients more time as the search for one continues.\n\n\u201cSlowing progression could help children retain abilities longer, reduce complications and improve quality of life \u2014 outcomes that matter profoundly to families,\u201d said Panwala, whose daughter has INAD.\n\nJoy amid uncertainty\n\nAs they wait to learn whether Jack will secure a spot in the trial, the Drurys have shifted their focus to making every day with their son count.\n\n\u201cWe all have a time that eventually ends,\u201d Tim said. \u201cJack\u2019s might be shorter than most of ours, but I want to fill the time that he does have here with as much love and joy as I can possibly provide.\u201d\n\nFor Jack, that means \u201cBaby Shark\u201d on repeat, impromptu dance parties, Ms. Rachel on TV and belly laughs so hard they give him hiccups.\n\nFor Kelsey and Tim, it\u2019s in every smile, every snuggle \u2014 and the outpouring of love from strangers who\u2019ve rallied for their little boy.\n\n\u201cYou see a lot of headlines in the news today about all of the hardships people face and the evil things that people do, but there\u2019s an incredible side of humanity that we\u2019ve been opened up to,\u201d Tim said.\n\n\u201cPeople have the capacity to do incredibly kind things for one another.\u201d"

With growing support for improved paternity rights, the summit reflects a significant shift in the conversation around fatherhood and gender equality.",

                "text": "\u201cWho\u2019s in your team?\u201d asked Elliott Rae, pumping up the crowd in central London at what he billed as the world\u2019s first Working Dads\u2019 summit. \u201cWho\u2019s your goalkeeper, your defender, your striker? Do you have a full 11? Do you have subs on the bench?.\u201d\n\nFootball analogies are generally rare at events about parenting, particularly those that seek to tackle gender equality. But then, so are men. At the Working Dads\u2019 summit \u2013 almost certainly the first in the UK \u2013 both were in plentiful supply, as fathers were urged to \u201ccreate a new idea of masculinity\u201d.\n\nRae, founder of the network Parenting Out Loud, which organised the event, urged fathers to start a \u201cnew national conversation about working dads\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are creating a new idea of masculinity. A new model for what it means to be a man and a dad,\u201d he told the several hundred attenders on Tuesday, who were joined by another 2,000 online.\n\n\u201cIn the face of increased far-right rhetoric, and some businesses rolling back D&I [diversity and inclusion] initiatives and demanding their employees come back into the office full-time \u2026 our voices need to be louder.\u201d\n\nRae said it was time for dads to be \u201cloud and proud\u201d about their parenting responsibilities, encouraging them to take all parental leave available to them, have an open calendar and be honest when they had to miss a meeting because of school drop-off or pickup.\n\nHe appealed to men and women to work together to push for more equal parenting, arguing that it was vital to combat the motherhood penalty, which recent analysis of Office for National Statistics data suggested contributes to women with children earning a third less per week and 20% less an hour than men with children. Noting that men account for about three-quarters of suicides in the UK, he argued that men involved in childcare were also less stressed and happier with their lives. \u201cIt\u2019s not a competition, it\u2019s not a zero-sum game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe summit will put further pressure on the government to improve the UK\u2019s paternity leave offering, which was ranked 40th out of 43 in an international comparison based on Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development figures. Last week the Commons women and equalities select committee called its failure to commit to improving the UK\u2019s paternity pay and leave during the current parliament \u201cdisappointing\u201d.\n\nA government review of the UK\u2019s parental leave system, which launched in July, was a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d said MPs, but \u201ctinkering around the edges of a broken system will let down working parents\u201d, they said.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Labour MP Stella Creasy warned that Labour\u2019s flagship employment rights bill could, by giving women better maternity rights, perversely result in more maternity discrimination in the short term. This could be combated by equalising parental leave, she said: \u201cChanging the law on parental rights so that every parent can be present is about every parent being equally discriminated against.\u201d\n\nThe summit is a significant marker in a year when growing numbers of men have joined women\u2019s voices in calling for better paternity leave in a bid to tackle entrenched inequality. In June, hundreds of fathers took to the streets to demand better paternity leave in the first ever \u201cDad strikes\u201d in London and Edinburgh.\n\nNew campaign group The Dad Shift, which organised the protest, have also rallied a new group of predominantly male Labour MPs, many with seats in \u201cred wall\u201d constituencies, who are putting internal pressure on the government to appeal to men directly.\n\n\u201cIt does feel like this is a moment, it\u2019s part of the zeitgeist,\u201d said attender Oliver Daniels, a father of one who works for the childcare platform Bubble. He pointed to the coronavirus pandemic, credited with causing an 18% increase in the amount of time fathers spend looking after their children, as a turning point in the conversation.\n\n\u201cDads suddenly found it wasn\u2019t just that they could be more involved parents, but that they wanted to be,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesperson said the government was committed to supporting parents to balance work and home and was making paternity leave a day-one right through the employment rights bill. \u201cWe know the parental leave system needs to be improved and are carrying out a review to ensure it best supports working families,\u201d they said."

                "text": "Fact-checking claims Trump made about autism\n\n11 hours ago\n\nMatt Murphy, Kayleen Devlin and Lucy GilderBBC Verify\n\nUS President Donald Trump has attracted condemnation from health experts, after he sought to claim that there was a link between the widely used painkiller Tylenol and autism.\n\nAccompanied by his Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump said that doctors would soon be advised not to recommend the drug - called paracetamol in some other countries, including the UK - to pregnant women.\n\nThe claims have been attacked by medical experts. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the announcement was \"unsettling\" and not based on \"reliable data\", while the UK's National Autism Society called Trump's statement \"dangerous, it's anti-science and it's irresponsible\".\n\nBBC Verify has looked at some of the allegations Trump and Kennedy made during their news conference at the White House.\n\nIs Trump correct that US autism diagnoses are rising?\n\nDuring the event, Trump listed a number of statistics which he said showed that autism diagnoses in the US have risen rapidly over the past two decades.\n\nFirstly, the US president claimed that incidence has increased from around \"one in 10,000\u2026probably 18 years ago\" to \"one in 31\" by 2025.\n\nThe final statistic quoted by Trump - that autism rates have risen to one in 31 - is correct. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2022 found that level of diagnoses among eight year olds across 16 US states.\n\nWhile that rate has grown from 18 years ago, it did not grow by anything like the figure cited by Trump. While there was no figure for 2007 - the year cited by Trump - in 2006 the CDC estimated the rate of autism in the US population to be 1 in 110. In 2008 it was 1 in 88.\n\nMost experts say rising rates of autism can primarily be attributed to changes in how the condition is diagnosed, as well as greater recognition of the condition and more people being tested.\n\nTrump also claimed on Sunday that California has a \"more severe problem\" with autism than other states surveyed by the CDC.\n\nThe CDC estimated that in 2022, about 1 in 12 eight-year old boys in California had autism - the highest rate for boys in the study across 16 US states.\n\nBut the agency noted that the state has funded a local initiative training hundreds of local paediatricians \"to screen and refer children for assessment as early as possible, which could result in higher identification\" of autism.\n\nShould the MMR vaccine be taken separately?\n\nAnother claim made by Trump is around the effects of the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The US president claimed that the vaccinations should \"be taken separately\" rather than as a combined shot and that \"it seems when you mix them, there could be a problem.\"\n\nExperts fear that if parents refrain from getting their children vaccinated as a result of his unfounded claims, it risks the re-emergence of diseases like measles.\n\nThe discredited idea that childhood vaccines are linked to autism first gained mainstream attention after a paper published in 1998 in the medical journal The Lancet by British doctor Andrew Wakefield.\n\nWakefield was later found to have financial conflicts of interest - including that some of his test patients connected with a lawsuit against vaccine companies - and the UK's General Medical Council (GMC) found that he falsified his results. The research paper was retracted and Wakefield was struck off by the GMC in 2010.\n\nMultiple studies since have found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The most recent - a high-quality study from Denmark in 2019 looked at 657,461 children, and concluded that the data did not support the MMR vaccine causing or triggering autism.\n\nOn its website, the US CDC recommends that two doses of the combined MMR vaccine are given to children, starting with the first dose at 12-15 months and the second between the ages of four and six.\n\nAccording to the UK government, there is \"no evidence\" that the jabs should be taken separately. It notes that any decision to do so \"would be experimental\".\n\nThis year, the US has seen the highest cases for measles in more than three decades. According to the CDC, 1,491 cases have been confirmed so far. Three people have died.\n\n\"President Trump produced no evidence that the current immunisation schedule in the States was harmful and no evidence that giving the combined MMR vaccine was unsafe,\" David Elliman - associate professor of children's health at University College London - said.\n\n\"Proponents of a link between MMR vaccine and autism cite the 1998 research paper in the Lancet, whose first author was Andrew Wakefield,\" he added. \"In fact, the authors of the paper clearly stated in the paper that they had not proven a link but suggested more research should be done. That research has been done, and no evidence of a link has been found.\"\n\nExperts also say that allowing time between jabs means children are more likely to contract diseases in the interim or that they are more likely to miss appointments if there are multiple shots.\n\nAre autism rates lower among Amish people?\n\nTrump cited the Amish as a group within the US who have \"virtually no autism\" within their community.\n\nThe Amish typically live in remote communities and refuse to adopt many features of modern life, which can include a suspicion of modern pharmaceuticals. Trump suggested - without providing evidence - that a low rate of Tylenol use within the group could have led to a lower rate of autism.\n\nThere are relatively few studies on autism rates within the Amish community. Many children are diagnosed in school - but most Amish drop out of school after eight grade, around 14-years-old.\n\n\"I think it's very very unlikely that there are no autistic people among the Amish,\" Eva Loth, professor of cognitive neuroscience at King's College London told BBC Verify.\n\n\"The question is how many population studies were carried out with the Amish? And are Amish people likely to seek a diagnosis? So there are a number of reasons why reported numbers may be low but that doesn't mean that no cases exist.\"\n\nTrump makes unproven link between autism and Tylenol\n\nWhat is autism and what are Trump's unproven claims about a Tylenol link?\n\nTrust doctors over Trump on paracetamol, Streeting says\n\nIn one 2010 study, a team of geneticists found autism occurred in approximately one in 271 Amish children. The research screened 1,899 children across two large Amish communities in Ohio and Indiana.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that research into this topic is limited, and we haven't found any studies which suggest a link between low immunisation rates and autism diagnosis among Amish people.\n\nTrump made a similar claim about low levels of autism in Cuba - claiming that Tylenol supplies are low on the island as the reason.\n\nIt's not clear what President Trump was basing the assertion on. BBC Verify could find no official Cuban statistic and the World Health Organization (WHO) has noted that the \"prevalence of autism in many low- and middle-income countries is unknown\".\n\nWhat has Trump said about autism previously?\n\nTrump has intermittently expressed concern over rising rates of autism in US children for almost 20 years. In 2007 he first publicly suggested that he believed that there was a link between vaccines and the increasing prevalence.\n\nThe president has expressed interest in Kennedy's work since at least 2017, when Kennedy said that Trump had asked him to lead a vaccine safety taskforce. Seven years later, Kennedy - who was then polling at around 5% - dropped his bid for the presidency and endorsed Trump.\n\nIn a leaked call with Kennedy during the election campaign and in which the Republican tried to coax the independent to support him - Trump was heard discussing discredited claims about the health risks of childhood vaccines. After the election Trump announced him as his choice to lead the department of health and human services, with a mandate to \"make America healthy again\".\n\nHowever, during his first term Trump did support some vaccine campaigns. During a 2019 measles outbreak in the US he said that people \"have to get the shots. Vaccinations are so important\", and it was his administration that oversaw the rapid development and early roll-out of Covid-19 vaccinations.\n\nAdditional reporting: Joshua Cheetham"

                "text": "During a press conference about Tylenol and autism risks, President Donald Trump repeated multiple inaccurate claims about a range of topics.\n\nOn Monday, Trump, joined by top administration officials, claimed the use of Tylenol during pregnancy may be linked to an increased risk of autism and that pregnant women should limit their use, contradicting medical evidence.\n\nABC News has evaluated some of the president's statements.\n\nCLAIM: Amish children do not get vaccines and do not get autism\n\nThis is a common anti-vaccine talking point. Studies have identified and diagnosed autism in Amish children along with other conditions, according to the International Society for Autism Research (INSAR). Also, not all Amish families decline regular childhood vaccinations, according to a study done by Science Direct.\n\nWhile Autism rates indeed appear lower among Amish communities, experts say this is likely due to factors like limited healthcare access and cultural attitude leading to underreporting - not because these conditions are absent in these communities, experts say.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, the White House reiterated that \"rates of autism among Amish children is lower than that of non-Amish children.\"\n\nCLAIM: Kids get 80 vaccines, 'horse-sized' shots; some ingredients may not be safe\n\nIt is not accurate that children get this many shots, nor is it accurate that children get an inappropriately large volume of vaccine.\n\nChildren get roughly 30 vaccine doses before the age of 18, excluding flu and COVID, according to the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pediatric vaccine recommendations. In recent years, the number of additives and ingredients in vaccines has been decreasing, doctors have explained.\n\nThe implication that children's immune systems get overwhelmed by vaccinations is not accurate, doctors say. Children's immune systems are exposed to many new bacteria and germs every day.\n\nThe vaccine schedule is recommended based on dosing and protecting young children at certain times in their development of their lives. Certain vaccines need to be given multiple times to build up immunity; meanwhile, certain diseases are more dangerous to younger children. Other vaccines are timed to offer community protection before children go off to school.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, the White House said, \"The American childhood vaccine schedule calls for substantially more vaccinations than the vaccine schedules of comparable wealthy nations such as Denmark.\"\n\nCLAIM: Tylenol causes autism when taken during pregnancy, pregnant women should 'tough it out'\n\nNo studies in people have shown that Tylenol (acetaminophen) directly causes autism. Some studies show a possible link, other studies show no such link, but all existing studies stop short of showing cause-and-effect.\n\nOne of the lead researchers of a major Harvard analysis showing an increased risk said in a statement, \"Further research is needed to confirm the association and determine causality.\"\n\nMeanwhile, fever during pregnancy is known to have serious risks, including a higher risk of stillbirth and miscarriage, according to the National Library of Medicine.\n\nAlison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, said, \"No new data or scientific studies were presented or shared. No new studies have been published in the literature. No new presentations on this topic were made at scientific or medical conferences. Instead, President Trump talked about what he thinks and feels without offering scientific evidence.\"\n\n\"The best quality evidence does not show that acetaphetamine causes autism,\" Jessica Steier, president and founder of Unbiased Science, told ABC News, \"There have been dozens of studies that have investigated this.\"\n\nCLAIM: Tylenol causes autism when given to young children\n\nNo studies have shown any link between autism and giving Tylenol to young children, despite Trump's repeated assertion that young children should not receive Tylenol. One large analysis of multiple studies found no link between giving acetaminophen after birth and autism or ADHD in children.\n\nSteier said that at this point, there is no evidence of any causal link between acetaminophen use in kids and autism.\n\n\"Genetics plays the largest role in autism likelihood, followed by environmental factors during pregnancy, and parental age,\" she said. \"It is unlikely that factors after birth have a significant impact on autism likelihood.\"\n\nCLAIM: There is 'no reason' to vaccinate newborns against hepatitis B\n\nDuring Monday's presser, Trump suggested there should be major changes to the current recommendation of vaccinating all newborns against hepatitis B, explaining that it is a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nHe said, \"I would say, wait until the baby is 12 years old and formed.\"\n\nHepatitis B can be transmitted sexually, but it can also be transmitted from mother-to-child during pregnancy, according to the World Health Organization. That is why current CDC guidance suggests infants are vaccinated in the hours after birth. If not vaccinated, a hepatitis B infection can lead to liver disease and liver cancer.\n\nIn a statement to ABC News, the White House said, \"Babies born to mothers who do not have HepB do not receive any immediate health benefits from HepB vaccination upon birth.\"But experts refute that characterization.\n\n\"Pediatricians know firsthand that children's immune systems perform better after vaccination against serious, contagious diseases like polio, measles, whooping cough and Hepatitis B. Spacing out or delaying vaccines means children will not have immunity against these diseases at times when they are most at risk,\" Dr. Susan Kressly, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement.\n\nABC News' Dr. Jamie Parkerson contributed to this report."

                "text": "Pregnant people should not be afraid to take Tylenol, experts say, rebuking unproven claims made by the Trump administration that it can cause autism.\n\nAt a news briefing Monday, President Donald Trump repeatedly issued a broad warning: \u201cIf you\u2019re pregnant, don\u2019t take Tylenol. When you have your baby, don\u2019t give your baby Tylenol at all unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u201d\n\nBut years of research have led major medical organizations in the United States to support the use of acetaminophen, or Tylenol, to treat pain and fever during pregnancy, with recommendations reflecting that the benefits outweigh any potential risks.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s White House event on autism was filled with dangerous claims and misleading information that sends a confusing message to parents and expecting parents and does a disservice to autistic individuals,\u201d Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement.\n\nThere are significant limitations to the conclusions that can be drawn from the research on the link between Tylenol and autism, experts say, and no new research was presented at Monday\u2019s briefing. Acetaminophen is still widely considered among the best and safest options to treat pain and fever during pregnancy.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is safe to use during pregnancy and recommends it as a first-line treatment \u2013 and the group confirmed Monday that it does not plan to change that guidance.\n\nThe Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine also reaffirmed its guidance that acetaminophen is an \u201cappropriate medication to treat pain and fever during pregnancy.\u201d\n\nPregnant patients should discuss any medication use during pregnancy with their provider, the organization says, but \u201cthe weight of evidence is inconclusive regarding a possible causal relationship between acetaminophen use and neurobehavioral disorders in the offspring.\u201d\n\nMarch of Dimes, a nonprofit focused on infant and maternal health, agrees.\n\n\u201cWhen families are going through pregnancy, or navigating life with a new baby, they have many questions. Access to accurate, science-based information to answer those questions can help ensure that every mom is healthy and every baby gets the best possible start,\u201d Chief Medical and Health Officer Dr. Michael Warren said in a statement.\n\nAcetaminophen is \u201cone of the safest and most effective options for managing pain and fever during pregnancy when taken as directed by a healthcare provider,\u201d he said. \u201cFever during pregnancy can carry significant risks for both mom and baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cDecades of research have found that acetaminophen is safe for children when administered as recommended,\u201d the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement. \u201cMisleading claims that the medicine is not safe and is linked to increased rates of autism send a confusing, dangerous message to parents and expectant parents and does a disservice to autistic individuals.\u201d\n\nThe body of research exploring the link between autism and acetaminophen use during pregnancy is not conclusive, and there\u2019s even less research looking at autism prevalence relative to acetaminophen use during infancy or early childhood.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing that was said during that conference today is that autism is complex with a multi-factorial etiology, and that is the truth,\u201d Dr. James McPartland, a child psychologist and director of the Yale Developmental Disabilities Clinic, told CNN. \u201cWhat that means is that autism is complicated, and there\u2019s not one cause.\u201d\n\nRisks vs. benefits\n\nEarlier this year, researchers from the University of South Florida and the University of British Columbia compiled a review of studies on the most commonly used pain medications during pregnancy and the potential risk to the fetus.\n\nSome drugs have been found to carry risk. Using the steroid prednisone during pregnancy, for example, may cause a cleft lip or palate birth defect. Ibuprofen such as Advil and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, should only be used in the second trimester, according to ACOG guidance. Research suggests that taking ibuprofen during the first trimester can cause miscarriage and has been linked to multiple birth defects. Some links to birth defects were also found when taken during the third trimester.\n\nTrump said Monday that there is \u201cno downside\u201d to not taking Tylenol during pregnancy, but it is widely understood that leaving pain or a fever untreated during pregnancy also carries serious risk.\n\nA research review published in the journal Pediatrics found that a fever during the first trimester could be especially dangerous, raising the risk of congenital heart defects, neural tube defects and oral clefts by up to three times.\n\nFever during pregnancy \u2013 especially high-grade fevers \u2013 can affect the fetus\u2019 brain development, and some studies have identified the fever itself as a risk factor for neurodevelopment disorders such as autism.\n\nExperts say that much more research is needed on the topic, and there is also some evidence that taking medicine to reduce fever could have a protective effect.\n\nSome people may want to avoid medication during pregnancy as much as possible, and many may opt to manage through a mild headache or other pain without taking anything, said Dr. Allison Bryant, an ob/gyn and maternal-fetal medicine specialist with Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nBut sometimes, providers might advise pregnant patients to take acetaminophen so they can be sure the pain can be treated and doesn\u2019t signify a more serious underlying condition, she said.\n\n\u201cIf someone has a headache in pregnancy, we oftentimes want to know that that headache will go away,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cWe sometimes use acetaminophen in a diagnostic way to know that it\u2019s not a headache associated with high blood pressure. So we want people not to be afraid to use it in those contexts when it\u2019s recommended.\u201d\n\nThe best of limited options\n\nAt Monday\u2019s briefing, health officials announced that the US Food and Drug Administration will issue a notice to physicians \u201cabout the risk of acetaminophen during pregnancy\u201d and work to change the safety label on products like Tylenol.\n\nThe US Department of Health and Human Services will advise clinicians to \u201cprescribe the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary duration and only when treatment is required,\u201d Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said.\n\nThis is generally in line with existing guidance from medical organizations.\n\n\u201cExisting guidance suggested to use Tylenol \u2013 and any drug \u2013 during pregnancy as sparingly as possible. So what was discussed today is actually very, very much in alignment with what\u2019s existed for a long time,\u201d McPartland said. \u201cPregnant women should be consulting with their obstetricians to determine what\u2019s appropriate for them given the risk factor associated with being ill during pregnancy.\u201d\n\nNuanced conversations are important because recommendations for treating pain or fever in a pregnant patient will be different than they are for people who are not pregnant, said Bryant, who also leads ACOG\u2019s clinical consensus committee on obstetrics.\n\n\u201cThe options are pretty limited, and the risk can be real,\u201d she said.\n\nExperts broadly agree that acetaminophen is one of the best options to manage pain and fever during pregnancy \u2013 it\u2019s an easily accessible over-the-counter drug that most pregnant people report using.\n\nDecades of research from large and case-control studies have found acetaminophen to be \u201cgenerally safe\u201d when taken as recommended during pregnancy, the recent review of studies found.\n\nBut more recent work that has focused potential links between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental outcomes including autism \u201csuffer from serious biases,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nThe Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine reviewed these studies before publishing its current guidance and also found significant limitations. Many studies are based on self-reported use of acetaminophen without details on size of the dose or duration of use. Some also rely on self-report of a neurodevelopmental disorder in the child without clinical confirmation.\n\nThe question then becomes whether acetaminophen itself is linked to autism or if the underlying pain or fever that led the pregnant person to take acetaminophen is the stronger link, Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CNN on Monday.\n\n\u201cIn these trials where you\u2019re looking back on things, you don\u2019t really get that clear causality relationship,\u201d Fleischman said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really premature to go out and say we found a cure, because even in the one or two studies that suggest a relationship, that relationship is very small and really, I would say, poorly designed studies that came to those results.\u201d\n\nSafe for children\n\nSimilarly, research does not show that giving acetaminophen to infants or children can cause autism, the American Academy of Pediatrics says, and \u201cextensive research indicates there is no single root cause of autism.\u201d\n\nThere is very specific guidance for dosing recommendations for children, the group says, and children younger than 12 weeks should not be given acetaminophen unless instructed by their pediatrician.\n\nAdditionally, children older than 6 months who have a fever may not need medicine unless they are uncomfortable or having difficulty drinking water or staying hydrated, the group says.\n\nExcessive use of acetaminophen poses serious risks to infants and children, but the identified risks are related to liver damage, not autism.\n\nParents and caregivers should always talk with their health care providers if they have questions or concerns, experts say.\n\nCommunication is key\n\nGuidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and others are meant to serve as evidence-based resources to support informed conversations between providers and their patients.\n\n\u201cAs with all medication use during pregnancy, communication regarding the risks versus the benefits of prescription and over-the-counter medications use should occur between patient and provider,\u201d the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine\u2019s publication committee says in a statement.\n\nIt\u2019s common for pregnant people to feel a lot of pressure to do things just right, and that stress can be a lot to handle, said Dr. Elizabeth Werner, a clinical psychologist with Columbia University who specializes in working with people during pregnancy and postpartum. Clinical studies involving pregnant people provide loose associations more often than causal links, she said, and that uncertainty can raise confusion and anxiety.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to make sure that you\u2019re doing the best that you can during your pregnancy, so it can be very stressful when you don\u2019t know what it is you\u2019re actually supposed to be doing or not supposed to be doing,\u201d she said.\n\nConsidering the sources of information becomes really important.\n\n\u201cI really recommend that people speak with their doctor and parse through information along with a doctor who knows the specifics of their life and their situation so they can make an educated decision about how best to proceed with something like medical treatment that they may need,\u201d Werner said."

There\u2019s no downside.\u201d\n\nHe also spoke about upcoming recommendations that vaccines such as the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) shots should be given in a delayed manner or in smaller doses, despite limited evidence of the impacts. And he spoke about the hepatitis B shot, currently given to newborns as part of national vaccine standards, and possible recommendations to delay the first dose \u2013 again with limited evidence.\n\nKennedy followed, announcing that the health department and US Food and Drug Administration would work to change the label on acetaminophen risks.\n\nAdministration officials also unveiled a plan to further investigate how a possible treatment for autism might exists in the shape of leucovorin, a drug currently used for patients with cancer and anemia.\n\nTrump, who has frequently voiced his concern over autism, said, along with Kennedy, that the US is suffering from an \u201cepidemic\u201d, and had flagged the major initiative on Sunday at Charlie Kirk\u2019s memorial in Arizona.\n\n\u201cTomorrow we\u2019re going to have one of the biggest announcement[s] \u2026 medically, I think, in the history of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to find it to be amazing. I think we found an answer to autism.\u201d\n\nOne in 31 children aged eight had a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) \u2013 a condition denoting communication and social difficulties, along with repetitive behaviors \u2013 in the US in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That compares to about one in 150 in 2000.\n\nKennedy, who previously peddled the theory that the condition is caused by vaccinations, has attributed the rise to \u201cenvironmental toxins\u201d.\n\nHe told Monday\u2019s event that the National Institutes of Health had been guilty of focusing \u201calmost solely on political safe and entirely fruitless research\u201d about autism\u2019s causes. He said was committed to investigating the \u201cetiology of the autism outbreak\u201d.\n\nHe called autism \u201ca complex condition with a multi-factorial etiology\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne area we are currently examining is vaccines,\u201d said Kennedy, who has frequently floated theories that the increase in the condition\u2019s prevalence is fueled by vaccinations.\n\nHowever, specialists say the increase is mainly due to increased screening, combined with evolving definitions of the disorder. They have also said the causes are predominantly dictated by genetics.\n\nScientists in the US and UK reacted to the Tylenol link sceptically, with British physicians denouncing it as \u201cfearmongering\u201d that risked stigmatising parents of children with autism.\n\nAlison Singer, president and founder of the Autism Science Foundation, voiced scathing criticism of the administration\u2019s approach \u2013 specifically its assertions on Tylenol, which she called \u201cnot scientifically based\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny association between Tylenol and autism is based on very limited, conflicting and inconsistent science, and it\u2019s premature to make this kind of unsubstantiated claim and risk undermining public health,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s misleading to families who deserve clear more factually based information.\u201d\n\nShe also questioned the basis of the White House announcement. \u201cWe\u2019re uncertain as to why this press conference is being held today. To our knowledge, there was no new data that were uncovered, no new studies published, no new presentations were made. There wasn\u2019t a scientific conference or a medical conference,\u201d Singer said.\n\nSpeaking on a call organized by Defend America Action, a campaign group, Debra Houry, a former chief medical officer and deputy director at the CDC, told journalists: \u201cAs of three weeks ago, we hadn\u2019t seen evidence that acetaminophen was linked with autism, so it\u2019s curious to know how quickly that was developed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are many studies which refute a link, but the most important was a Swedish study of 2.4m births published in 2024 which used actual sibling data and found no relationship between exposure to paracetamol [known in the US as acetaminophen] in utero and subsequent autism, ADHD or intellectual disability,\u201d said Dr Monique Botha, associate professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University\n\n\u201cThe fearmongering will prevent women from accessing the appropriate care during pregnancy.\n\nUS medical practitioners also cast doubt on the putative link with acetaminophen.\n\nDan Jernigan, another former CDC career scientist and former director of the national center for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases, criticised Kennedy\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cWe were all asked to be a part of autism studies and to put together [an autism plan],\u201d he said. We helped develop some of that. But then over time, what we saw was [Kennedy] having an increasingly top down approach, essentially \u2018my way or the highway,\u2019 with no regard again for the scientific processes.\u201d\n\nSome researchers have also pleaded caution on hopes for leucovorin, which has been reportedly shown in some tests to trigger marked improvements in the speaking and understanding ability of some people with autism.\n\nIrva Hertz-Picciotto, an epidemiologist and autism specialist at the University of California, Davis, told the Washington Post that unrealistic expectations could lead to a loss of trust.\n\n\u201cI worry that it feels like everything is now tainted that comes out of the current administration,\u201d she said.\n\nBruce Mirken, communications co-chair of Defend Public Health, poured cold water on the announcements in advance. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t know what he will claim today, we do know that Kennedy has a history of false statements related to autism and that the scientific evidence shows there is no \u2018autism epidemic\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Melody Schreiber and agencies"

Bill Cassidy, a licensed physician who chairs the Senate committee that oversees health care policy, publicly split with the Trump administration over Monday\u2019s advisory that pregnant women not use Tylenol.\n\nCassidy (R-La.), who leads the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, argued in a statement that the \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d shows there is no solid link between the pain reliever and a spike in autism diagnoses, while calling on the Trump administration to release evidence underpinning that conclusion.\n\n\u201cI understand and applaud President Trump\u2019s desire to address this issue and to support HHS [Health and Human Services],\u201d Cassidy wrote on X.\n\n\u201cHHS should release the new data that it has to support this claim,\u201d he added. \u201cThe preponderance of evidence shows that this is not the case. The concern is that women will be left with no options to manage pain in pregnancy. We must be compassionate to this problem.\u201d\n\nThe president and his top health officials dramatically claimed that acetaminophen, the main ingredient in Tylenol, can lead to a \u201cvery increased risk of autism.\u201d\n\nDecades of research and medical understanding had indicated that Tylenol was one of the few safe painkillers to use during pregnancy, since aspirin and ibuprofen are known to have potentially adverse effects on the fetus if taken in higher doses.\n\nAutism affected about one in 31 8-year-olds in the US in 2022, according to the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.\n\nBy contrast, approximately one in 150 children were diagnosed with the neurological developmental condition in 2000.\n\nDriving the Trump administration\u2019s quest to tackle the rise in autism cases is HHS Secretary Robert F.

Since then, the HELP Committee chairman has raised public concerns about some of Kennedy\u2019s statements on vaccines.\n\nLast week, Cassidy oversaw a hearing to investigate the firing of former CDC Director Susan Monarez due to an apparent clash with Kennedy over vaccine policy.\n\nThe White House released a fact sheet Monday citing multiple studies which it claimed show \u201cacetaminophen use in pregnant women, especially late in pregnancy, may cause long-term neurological effects in their children.\u201d\n\nOne of those studies, which was conducted by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, found that \u201chigher-quality studies are more likely to show a link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and increased risks of autism and ADHD,\u201d researcher Dr. Diddier Prada claimed.\n\n\u201cGiven the widespread use of this medication, even a small increase in risk could have major public health implications,\u201d he added prior to the White House announcement.\n\nNotably, that study was unable to determine any direct link between acetaminophen use and autism in children.\n\nMultiple medical experts have expressed deep apprehension about the White House\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement by HHS is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children,\u201d American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) president Dr. Steven Fleischman said in a statement Monday.\n\n\u201cIt is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.\u201d\n\nKenvue, the manufacturer of Tylenol, also strongly disputed the Trump administration\u2019s accusations.\n\n\u201cAcetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy,\u201d a company spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWithout it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.\u201d"

That we are too small to resist. That we are not a country, only a territory,\" the president declared, pointing to Russian involvement at the highest level.\n\n\"But Moldova is our home. And our home is not for sale.\"\n\nPro-Russian parties have accused Sandu of trying to intimidate them - and sway the vote.\n\nSandu also called on supporters to come out and cast their ballots on Sunday in an election in which pro-Russian forces are set to shake the pro-EU status quo. The majority held by Sandu's own Party of Action and Solidarity, PAS, seen at risk.\n\nFor her, a high turnout \u2013 especially among the diaspora - is key.\n\nMoldova declared its independence as the USSR fell apart over 30 years ago, but it has a significant Russian-speaking population. The breakaway region of Transnistria, propped up by Moscow, is still home to a contingent of Russian troops.\n\nFor years Moscow's influence has lingered in Moldovan politics.\n\nBut under President Sandu, the country has launched talks to join the EU and last year held a referendum in which voters chose to enshrine the goal of accession to the bloc in their constitution.\n\nThat ballot was the president's initiative, an attempt to set Moldova's EU path in stone.\n\nIn the end, the \"yes\" vote won by only a small margin of 50.4% to 49.5%. The referendum was mired by extensive evidence of Russian meddling \u2013 including cash being smuggled into the country to buy votes.\n\nIt's thought that only a small percentage of the money being sent is intercepted \u2013 10 to 15% of the total \u2013 and in Moldova, with its small population, every ballot counts.\n\n\"With 200,000 votes it's possible to change everything: it's enough to look at the EU referendum in October, which was decided by such a small margin,\" Sergiu Panainte, deputy director of the German Marshall Fund in Bucharest, points out.\n\n\"The fines now for selling your vote are really big but there are still people willing to do it.\"\n\nRussia's hybrid attacks are a large part of the problem for Sandu's PAS, but not all of it.\n\nOpponents accuse the government of not going far enough in tackling corruption, for example, and in Russian-speaking regions like Gagauzia, voters believe Moldova should engage with Moscow and not \"antagonise\" it.\n\nPresident Sandu and her supporters strongly disagree.\n\nIn 2022, when Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Moldova's neighbour Ukraine, she made a decisive turn towards Europe as the only guarantor of her own country's security and its sovereignty.\n\nThe latest police raids suggest Moscow hasn't given up.\n\nSeparately, on Monday, Bloomberg news agency reported that it had seen documents outlining extensive Russian plans to seed unrest and warp the vote.\n\nRussia's SVR foreign intelligence service has now issued its own statement, deliberately mirroring what was said by Moldova. It claims that European countries themselves are plotting the \"blatant falsification\" of the result on Sunday in order to provoke protests.\n\nThe SVR even warns that the EU could mount \"an armed incursion and de-facto occupation\" of Moldova, falsely claiming that the EU is deploying troops.\n\n\"This is Russia openly planning for Plan B,\" Sergiu Panainte warns. \"If PAS do get a majority, it means they [Russia] will resort to violence and staged attacks.

Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said.\n\nBacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.\n\n\"The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,\" said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.\n\nIt's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said.\n\nThat may play out in doctors' offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat \u2014 like urinary tract infections \u2014 could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report's authors.\n\nAntimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise \u2014 unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn't kill the germs made them stronger.\n\nIn recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to \"nightmare bacteria\" resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.\n\nResearchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.\n\nThey counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.\n\nThe rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 \u2014 an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 \u2014 an increase of 460%, the authors said.\n\nA researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,\" said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.\n\nThe CDC's count is only a partial picture.\n\nMany states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren't able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.\n\nThe CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections \"is definitely underestimated,\" Burnham said."

Experts warn that these new restrictions may create barriers to access, particularly for younger individuals and children, and raise concerns about the potential for increased Covid outbreaks. The upcoming recommendations from the CDC's advisory committee on immunization practices are anticipated with apprehension, given the recent changes in leadership and the unclear definition of \"high risk\" for vaccine eligibility.",
                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "There is a lot of confusion about Covid vaccines this year.\n\nIn late August, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it had rescinded emergency use authorizations (a tool that allows the FDA to expedite the availability of certain medications) for Covid-19 vaccines. It also said it had approved updated versions of the Covid-19 vaccine, but only for certain groups.\n\nNew restrictions limit shots to adults 65 and older and those with at least one underlying condition that puts them at higher risk for severe Covid \u2013 a significant shift from previous guidelines, which approved Covid vaccines for all Americans that are six months and older. The move comes as a new Covid variant known as XFG or \u201cStratus\u201d is spreading in the US.\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary and prominent vaccine skeptic, praised the FDA in a post on X, saying that the framework ended Biden-era vaccine \u201cmandates\u201d while still keeping \u201cvaccines available to those who want them\u201d.\n\nFDA commissioner, Dr Marty Makary, echoed this, writing in his own post: \u201c100% of the adults in this country can still get the vaccine if they choose.\u201d\n\nBut access probably may not be that straightforward, say experts; in early September, some Americans have already reported difficulty in getting the Covid vaccine.\n\n\u201cWe have plenty of Covid circulating in the US,\u201d says Dr Adam Ratner, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) committee on infectious disease. \u201cThe more people who choose not to vaccinate their kids and not to vaccinate themselves, the more it will spread.\u201d He adds that he worries that fewer people getting vaccinated could lead to \u201clarger and more severe outbreaks\u201d.\n\nBelow, what we currently know about the availability of Covid-19 vaccines in the US in 2025.\n\nWhat Covid vaccines will be available this year?\n\nKennedy announced that the FDA had approved Moderna vaccines for those six months and older, Pfizer vaccines for those five years old and older, and Novavax vaccines for those 12 years old and older.\n\nWho can get a Covid vaccine this year?\n\nAlthough administration health officials claim that any adult who wants a vaccine will be able to get one, experts say that is unlikely to be the case in practice.\n\n\u201cThis is misleading,\u201d wrote Dr Jake Scott, a clinical associate professor of infectious diseases at Stanford Medicine, in a reply to Makary\u2019s tweet. He went on to outline barriers the new restrictions have imposed: \u201cInsurance won\u2019t cover off-label use ($150+ costs), pharmacies can\u2019t administer [vaccines] without CDC recommendations you haven\u2019t issued, and you eliminated Pfizer for under-5s entirely.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Available\u2019 with barriers isn\u2019t accessible,\u201d he concluded.\n\nScott told the Guardian that the FDA\u2019s announcement \u201ccauses so much chaos and confusion\u201d.\n\nUnder the FDA\u2019s newly announced rules, people under 65 must be considered \u201chigh risk\u201d to qualify.\n\nIt is unclear whether official CDC immunization guidelines will be the same. The CDC\u2019s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), which develops recommendations for the use of vaccines, will meet in September and discuss Covid vaccine policy.\n\nBut there is concern among the medical community about the ACIP\u2019s upcoming recommendations. In June, Kennedy fired all 17 sitting members of the panel, and announced eight new members, many of whom are vocal vaccine skeptics.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of concern about this ACIP and our ability to get science-based recommendations from them,\u201d says Ratner.\n\nWho counts as \u2018high risk\u2019 for Covid vaccine eligibility?\n\nUnder the FDA\u2019s new rules, adults under 65 qualify for a Covid vaccine if they have \u201cat least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from Covid-19\u201d.\n\nBut what qualifies as an underlying condition is unclear. \u201cThe definitive answer to that has not been put out by the FDA or the CDC yet,\u201d says Dr Richard Ricciardi, a practicing nurse practitioner and associate dean for clinical practice and community engagement at the George Washington University School of Nursing. \u201cSo who qualifies for a vaccine is still a little nebulous.\u201d\n\nA previous list put out by the CDC in February 2025 lists 22 qualifying conditions, including asthma, cancer, diabetes types 1 and 2, HIV, mental health conditions including depression, obesity, physical inactivity and smoking.\n\nThere is also reason to believe that the CDC\u2019s new list will not be the same. Although the previous list includes pregnancy as an underlying condition, Kennedy announced in May that Covid vaccines were no longer recommended for healthy pregnant women and children.\n\nThis reversal was made without the usual outside input by professional medical organizations, and in June, the AAP and dozens of other major medical associations signed an open letter opposing this new policy.\n\n\u201cPregnancy\u2019s a risk factor for a lot of reasons,\u201d says Ricciardi. \u201cYour lungs are compressed, your immune system changes dramatically and you don\u2019t fight off infections as well as you would when you\u2019re not pregnant.\u201d\n\nRicciardi adds that pregnant women have safely been getting Covid vaccines for years. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re not able to,\u201d he says.\n\nCan children get the Covid vaccine?\n\nSince the CDC no longer recommends Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children, there is confusion among parents and healthcare providers about whether children will be able to get Covid vaccines or other routine vaccines, says Ratner.\n\nThe new guidelines are at odds with the AAP\u2019s recommended vaccine schedule, Ratner says. The AAP\u2019s position is that \u201cinfants and children 6 months through 23 months of age are at high risk for severe Covid-19\u201d and that all of those within this group who do not have any contraindications should be vaccinated against the disease.\n\n\u201cFor older kids, a risk-based approach is reasonable,\u201d says Ratner. The group suggests that any child with high risk factors should be vaccinated, and any parents who want their children \u2013 high risk or not \u2013 to get vaccinated should be able to do so.\n\nGoing forward, parents will have to consult with pediatricians to determine whether their child gets a vaccine. If they have a healthy child, the pediatrician may have to administer the vaccine off-label (meaning an unapproved use of a drug) and there is no guarantee doctors will be comfortable doing this.\n\n\u201cI wish I had a good answer to how people are going to access vaccines in the coming weeks and months,\u201d says Ratner. \u201cI guess we will find out more, but it\u2019s a frustrating and confusing time for all of us.\u201d\n\nWhat if you want a Covid vaccine but don\u2019t qualify for one under the new guidelines?\n\nIn theory, it is possible for adults who do not qualify as high-risk to get off-label prescriptions. But Scott says he suspects there\u2019s going to be a lot of hesitation among doctors to \u201cprescribe something off-label that they may be liable for\u201d.\n\n\u201cCan you go to Canada and get it? Yeah, you probably could,\u201d says Ricciardi. \u201cBut why would we have to go to another country to get vaccinated?\u201d\n\nWhere can you get a Covid vaccine this year?\n\nDuring the 2024-2025 cold and flu season, nearly 90% of people who received a Covid shot received it in a pharmacy, according to CDC data.\n\nBut pharmacists aren\u2019t sure what the 2025-2026 season will look like.\n\n\u201cPharmacists are a little bit anxious because if the ACIP takes on and recommends the same guidelines the FDA has approved, a lot of patients will be unable to get a Covid-19 vaccine,\u201d says Allison Hill, the director of professional affairs at the American Pharmacists Association.\n\nPharmacy regulations also vary from state to state. Some states have their own statutes, while others follow ACIP recommendations. And some states allow pharmacists to administer vaccines that are off-label, while others do not.\n\nThis confusing tangle of rules led two of the country\u2019s biggest pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens, to temporarily limit how and where they were providing vaccines. A spokesperson for CVS said at the end of August that the chain would continue to offer vaccines in 34 states, require prescriptions to administer them in 13 states and the District of Columbia, and stop offering Covid vaccines altogether in Massachusetts, Nevada and New Mexico.\n\nSince then, Massachusetts, Nevada and New Mexico have all issued public health orders that allow pharmacists in the states to administer Covid vaccines.\n\nOther states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, New York and Pennsylvania, have also issued orders to broaden access. And California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington have formed the West Coast Alliance to provide \u201cunified recommendations on immunizations to residents based on science, not politics\u201d.\n\nEven if one is eligible under the new guidelines, getting a Covid vaccine at a pharmacy may be more complicated than in the past, and patients over 65 have reported being turned away from pharmacies because they didn\u2019t have a prescription.\n\nPatients may also be able to get vaccines at their doctor\u2019s office, but that\u2019s not guaranteed. Even if someone is at high risk, getting a prescription for a vaccine may not be easy. \u201cIn the US, a lot of people don\u2019t have insurance,\u201d says Scott. \u201cAnd a lot of people who have insurance don\u2019t have primary care doctors, and they don\u2019t get much medical attention.\u201d\n\nRequiring people to jump through hoops will only further deter people from getting vaccines, says Hill.\n\n\u201cWe know that patients, when they come into the pharmacy and you talk to them about a vaccine, they really need to get that vaccine then and there,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you have to wait on a prescription, you lose the patient.\u201d\n\nIf you have already received Covid vaccines and boosters, how protected are you?\n\nFor otherwise healthy individuals, the first two or three doses of the Covid-19 vaccine and booster \u201cdid a fantastic job\u201d in protecting against serious illness, Scott says.\n\nProtection is highest if you\u2019ve received a vaccine booster within the last six to nine months, says Ricciardi. But prior immunity from vaccines can still protect against \u201csevere disease, hospitalization and death\u201d, he says. However, this immunity wanes over time, and that protection may also be reduced as new variants of Covid arise.\n\nWhat other measures should you take to avoid Covid?\n\nOne of the major benefits vaccine boosters provided to people was peace of mind, says Scott.\n\n\u201cA lot of people feel like if they can\u2019t get the Covid-19 vaccine, they shouldn\u2019t see their grandma,\u201d says Scott. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really sad.\u201d\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been able to get the Covid vaccine yet this year, Ricciardi suggests taking basic safety and hygiene precautions: washing your hands regularly; wearing a mask in crowded indoor spaces and on public transit; staying up to date on other vaccines, including flu, RSV and pneumonia; and staying alert to local Covid trends."

                "text": "The Gen Z revolution in Asia shows the power of the young - and their limits\n\n5 hours ago\n\nTessa WongAsia Digital Reporter\n\nIt was the wedding of the daughter of a Nepalese politician that first angered Aditya. The 23-year-old activist was scrolling through his social media feed in May, when he read complaints about how the high-profile marriage ceremony sparked huge traffic jams in the city of Bhaktapur.\n\nWhat riled him most were claims that a major road was blocked for hours for VIP guests, who reportedly included the Nepalese prime minister.\n\nThough the claim was never verified and the politician later denied that his family had misused state resources, Aditya's mind was made up.\n\nIt was, he decided, \"really unacceptable\".\n\nOver the next few months he noticed more of what he saw as extravagances, posted on social media by politicians and their children - exotic holidays, pictures showing off mansions, supercars and designer handbags.\n\nSaugat Thapa, a provincial minister's son, posted a photograph that went viral. It showed an enormous pile of gift boxes from Louis Vuitton, Cartier and Christian Louboutin, decorated with fairy lights and Christmas baubles and topped with a Santa hat.\n\nOn 8 September, determined to fight what he saw as corruption, Aditya and his friends joined thousands of young protesters on the streets of the capital Kathmandu.\n\nAs the protests gathered pace, there were clashes between demonstrators and police, leaving some protesters dead.\n\nThe following day, crowds stormed parliament and burned down government offices. The prime minister KP Sharma Oli resigned.\n\nIn all some 70 people were killed.\n\nThis was one part of a fervour for change that has swept across Asia in recent months.\n\nIndonesians have staged demonstrations, as have Filipinos, with tens of thousands protesting in the capital Manila on Sunday. They all have one thing in common: they are driven by Generation Z, many of whom are furious at what they see as endemic corruption in their countries.\n\nGovernments in the region say there is a risk of the protests spiralling into unacceptable violence. But Aditya, like many demonstrators, believes it is the start of an era of newfound protester power.\n\nHe was inspired by the protests in Indonesia, as well as last year's student-led revolution in Bangladesh and the Aragalaya protest movement that toppled Sri Lanka's president in 2022, and he argues that all stand for the same thing: the \"wellbeing and development of our nations\".\n\n\"We learnt that there is nothing that we - this generation of students and youths - cannot do.\"\n\nBacklash against 'nepo kids'\n\nMuch of the anger has focused on so-called \"nepo kids\" - young people perceived as benefitting from the fame and influence of their well-connected parents, many of whom are establishment figures.\n\nTo many demonstrators, these \"nepo kids\" symbolise deeper corruption.\n\nSome of those targeted have denied these allegations. Saugat Thapa said it was \"an unfair misinterpretation\" that his family was corrupt. Others have gone quiet.\n\nBut behind it all is a discontent over social inequality and a lack of opportunities.\n\nPoverty remains a persistent issue in these countries, which also suffer from low social mobility.\n\nMultiple studies have shown that corruption reduces economic growth and deepens inequality. In Indonesia, corruption has been a serious impediment to the country's development, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nSince the start of the year, demonstrations have been held there over government budget cuts and, among other things, worries over economic prospects amid stagnating wages. In August, protests erupted over lawmakers' housing perks.\n\nOnline hashtags circulated - #IndonesiaGelap (Dark Indonesia) and #KaburAjaDulu (Just Run Away First) - urging people to find opportunities elsewhere.\n\nZikri Afdinel Siregar, a 22-year-old university student living in North Sumatra in Indonesia, protested earlier this month, angered at local lawmakers receiving large housing allowances of 60 million rupiah (\u00a32,670) per month, roughly 20 times the average income.\n\nBack at home in the Riau province, Zikri's parents have a small rubber plantation and do farm work on other people's land, earning them four million rupiah (\u00a3178) a month.\n\nHe has been working as a motorcycle taxi driver to help cover his tuition fees and living costs.\n\n\"There are still many people who have difficulty buying basic necessities, especially food, which is still expensive now,\" he says.\n\n\"But on the other hand, officials are getting richer, and their allowances are getting higher.\"\n\nIn Nepal, one of the poorest countries in Asia, young people have expressed similar disillusionment at what they see as an unfair system.\n\nTwo years ago, in a case that shocked the nation, a young entrepreneur died after setting himself on fire outside parliament.\n\nIn his suicide note, he blamed the lack of opportunities.\n\nHarnessing TikTok and AI\n\nDays before the protests began in Nepal, the government announced a ban on most social media platforms for not complying with a registration deadline.\n\nThe government claimed it wanted to tackle fake news and hate speech. But many young Nepalese viewed it as an attempt to silence them.\n\nAditya was one of them.\n\nHe and four friends hunkered down in a library in Kathmandu with mobile phones and computers, and used AI platforms ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek and Veed to make 50 social media clips about \"nepo kids\" and corruption.\n\nOver the next few days they posted them, mostly TikTok which had not been banned - using multiple accounts and virtual private networks to evade detection. They called their group 'Gen Z Rebels'.\n\nThe first video, set to the Abba song, The Winner Takes It All, was a 25-second clip from the wedding that had enraged Aditya weeks ago, featuring pictures of the politician's family along with headlines about the wedding.\n\nIt ended with a call to action: \"I will join. I will fight against corruption and against political elitism. Will you?\"\n\nWithin a day it had 135,000 views, its reach boosted by online influencers who recirculated it along with other posts, according to Aditya.\n\nOther groups based in Nepal and abroad also created clips, and shared them using Discord.\n\nThe gaming chat platform has been used by thousands of protesters in Nepal, where they discuss next moves and suggest who to nominate an interim leader for the country.\n\nIn the Philippines too, more than 30,000 people have contributed to a Reddit thread known as a \"lifestyle check\" campaign, in which many post details about the rich and powerful.\n\nYoung people harnessing technology for mass movements is nothing new \u2013 in the early 2000s text messaging propelled the second People's Power Revolution in the Philippines, while the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street in the 2010s relied heavily on Twitter.\n\nWhat's different now is the sheer sophistication of the technology, with the widespread use of mobile phones, social media, messaging apps and now AI making it easier for people to mobilise.\n\n\"This is what [Gen Zs] grew up with, this is how they communicate\u2026 How this generation organises itself is a natural manifestation of that,\" says Steven Feldstein, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nPolitical solidarity across nations\n\nTechnology has also brokered a sense of solidarity among protesters in different countries.\n\nA cartoon skull logo popularised by Indonesian demonstrators has been adopted by Philippine and Nepalese protesters too, appearing on protest flags, video clips and social media profile pictures.\n\nThe hashtag #SEAblings (a play on siblings in South East Asia or near the sea) has also trended online, as Filipinos, Indonesians and other nations express support for one another's anti-corruption movements.\n\nIt is true that Asia has previously seen similar waves of political solidarity across the region, from the Myanmar and Philippine uprisings in the late 1980s to the Milk Tea Alliance that began in 2019 with the Hong Kong demonstrations, according to Jeff Wasserstrom, a historian at the University of California Irvine. But he says this time it is different.\n\n\"[These days] the images [of protests] go further and faster than before, so you have a much bigger saturation of images of what's happening in other places.\"\n\nTechnology has also stoked emotions. \"When you actually see it on your phone - the mansion, the fast cars \u2013 it just makes [the corruption] seem more real,\" says Ash Presto, a Philippine sociologist with the Australian National University.\n\nThe impact is especially pronounced among Filipinos, who are among the world's most active social media users, she adds.\n\nDeaths, destruction - now what?\n\nThese protests have all led to serious consequences offline. Buildings have burnt down, homes have been looted and ransacked, and politicians have been dragged from their houses and beaten.\n\nThe damage to buildings and businesses alone is worth hundreds of millions of US dollars.\n\nMore than 70 people were killed in Nepal, and 10 people have died in Indonesia.\n\nGovernments have condemned the violence. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto criticised what he called behaviour \"leaning towards treason and terrorism \u2026 [and] destruction of public facilities, looting at homes\".\n\nIn the Philippines, President Ferdinand Marcos said protesters were right to be concerned about corruption, but urged them to be peaceful.\n\nMeanwhile Philippine minister Claire Castro warned that people with \"ill intentions [who] want to destabilise the government\" were exploiting the public's outrage.\n\nProtesters, however, have blamed \"infiltrators\" for the violence and in Nepal's case many claim that the high death toll was due to a heavy-handed crackdown by the police (which the government has said they will investigate).\n\nAmong it all, governments have also acknowledged the protesters' concerns and in some cases agreed to certain demands.\n\nIndonesia has scrapped some of the financial incentives for lawmakers, like the controversial housing allowance, as well as overseas trips. And in the Philippines, an independent commission has been set up to investigate the possible misuse of flood prevention funds, with President Marcos promising there would be \"no sacred cows\" in the hunt.\n\nThe question now is, what follows the fury?\n\nFew digital-driven protests have translated to fundamental social change, observers point out - especially in places where problems like corruption remain deeply entrenched.\n\nThis is partly due to the leaderless nature of these demonstrations, which on the one hand helps protesters evade clampdowns - but also impedes long-term decision-making.\n\n\"[Social media] inherently is not designed for long-term change\u2026 you are relying on algorithms and outrage and hashtags to sustain it,\" Dr Feldstein points out.\n\n\"[Change requires people to] find a way to change from a disparate online movement to a group that has a longer-term vision, with bonds that are physical as well as online.\n\n\"You need people to come up with viable political strategies, not just going with a zero-sum, burn-it-all-down strategy.\"\n\nThis was evident in previous conflicts, including in 2006 when Nepal's millennials took part in a revolution that ousted the monarchy, following a Maoist insurgency and a decade-long civil war. But the country then cycled through 17 governments, while its economy stagnated.\n\nThe previous generation of Nepalese protesters \"ended up becoming part of the system and lost their moral ground,\" argues Narayan Adhikari, co-founder of Accountability Lab, an anti-corruption group.\n\n\"They didn't follow democratic values and backtracked from their own commitment.\"\n\nBut Aditya vows that this time will be different.\n\n\"We are continuously learning from the mistakes of our previous generation,\" he says firmly. \"They were worshipping their leaders like a god.\n\n\"Now in this generation, we do not follow anyone like a god.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Astudestra Ajengrastri and Ayomi Amindoni of BBC Indonesian, and Phanindra Dahal of BBC Nepali\n\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

                "text": "Nepal\u2019s prime minister has resigned after some of the worst unrest in decades rocked the country this week, set off by a ban on social media and discontent at political corruption and nepotism.\n\nKP Sharma Oli\u2019s resignation came a day after widespread protests were met with deadly force by police, leaving 19 dead and hundreds injured. The spark for the protests was a government ban on 26 prominent social media apps, but escalated into a larger mass movement against corruption among political elites.\n\nThe government decision to roll back the ban on sites such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and X on Monday night did nothing to quell the anger among young people, who continued what was called the \u201cGen Z\u201d protests.\n\nIn defiance of curfews, protests continued to erupt across the country on Tuesday and thousands stormed the federal parliament building in Kathmandu and set it alight. Fires burned across the streets of the capital, turning the sky black with smoke, and riot police were pelted with stones.\n\nThe country\u2019s political leaders were evacuated to safe locations, as anger at the government swelled on the streets, and Kathmandu airport was closed down.\n\nAs calls for the resignation of Oli grew on Tuesday, his home was set on fire. Homes of the president and other prominent ministers were also attacked as Gen Z protesters took control of the country\u2019s main administrative area, Singha Durbar.\n\nBy early Tuesday afternoon Oli had submitted his resignation letter to the president , an announcement which was met with cheers by protesters who were gathered around the parliament building, and Nepal\u2019s president, Ram Chandra Paudel. The home minister had already resigned on Monday night over the killing of protesters.\n\nChaos continued in the streets even after Oli\u2019s resignation and by Tuesday night, Nepal\u2019s army chief confirmed that army troops were to be deployed on the streets from 10pm to maintain order. \u201cSome groups are taking undue advantage of the extraordinary circumstances to cause extensive damage to ordinary citizens and public property,\u201d said the army in a statement.\n\nRohan Ansari, 20, said he had seen his friend shot dead by police before his eyes on Monday as they protested in the streets of Kathmandu. \u201cBut today, the Gen Z movement has succeeded,\u201d he said, standing outside the stormed parliament building, which billowed with thick black smoke. \u201cNow, his soul will rest in peace. From now on, the work will be led by the youth. The files of their corruption will be exposed.\u201d\n\nOli, 73, is seen as a veteran of Nepali politics and began his fourth term last year after his Communist party forged a coalition government with the centre-left Nepali Congress. In his letter, Oli said he had resigned in order to \u201cfacilitate a solution to the problem and help resolve it politically\u201d. In the aftermath of Oli\u2019s resignation, Nepal\u2019s president, Ram Chandra Paudel, invited Gen Z protest leaders for talks.\n\nDissatisfaction, particularly among the younger generation, has grown as Nepal has been crippled by political instability, corruption and slow economic development, with swathes of the population forced to travel abroad to find work.\n\nA string of high-profile corruption cases among senior political figures has dominated headlines and social media has been awash with images of the luxury spending habits of the children of the country\u2019s political elites, fuelling resentment as ordinary Nepalis face economic hardship and and unemployment.\n\nNaresh Rawal, 27, said the protests had been the only way to force change. \u201cCorruption has gone so far that leaders have accumulated Land Rovers, bullets and millions of rupees in their homes,\u201d said Rawal.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t drink regular water, they have cartons of imported water. Where does all that luxury come from? Where did this wealth come from? Where did their children get money for lavish trips every month? This is why this was necessary action. Now the country can move forward on the path of reform.\u201d\n\nTanuja Pandey, 24, was among those who called for Oli and his ministers to face a criminal investigation for the deadly use of force against protesters. \u201cThis is not just a death of 19 youths \u2013 it is murder,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government\u2019s hands are stained with blood. The government cannot escape accountability this time.\u201d\n\nThe government said on Monday it had formed a committee to investigate the violence and would pay compensation to the families of the dead and provide free treatment for injured people.\n\nAmnesty International said live ammunition had been used against protesters on Monday, and the United Nations demanded a swift and transparent inquiry.\n\nThe ban on social media came after Nepal\u2019s government gave social media firms a seven-day deadline to register and comply with new regulations. All but five failed to register on time and as a result Meta\u2019s Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, Alphabet\u2019s YouTube, China\u2019s Tencent and Snapchat, Pinterest and X were blocked by midnight on Thursday.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision caused outrage among Nepal\u2019s youth, many who saw it as an attempt to suppress their criticism of the government.\n\n\u201cThe corruption that has permeated every level of the country must end,\u201d said Raksha Bam, 26. \u201cBut instead of stopping that corruption, they shut down the civic space of our generation. That is why Gen Z gathered in one place.\u201d"

                "text": "Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s return to the nation\u2019s airwaves is proof of just how unseriously the liberal media takes left-wing violence.\n\nIf Johnny Carson had gone on air after the murder of John F. Kennedy and said, \u201cWe hit some new lows this weekend with the Democrat gang trying to characterize this kid who killed President Kennedy as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\u201d what would his network have done?\n\nKimmel is a hater and a purveyor of disinformation, but he\u2019s able to get away with saying that about \u201cthe MAGA gang\u201d because his bosses approve of the lie.\n\nIndeed, liberals have spent the days since Charlie Kirk\u2019s murder insisting that the real danger to free speech comes not from left-wing killers\u2019 bullets but from Republican officials.\n\nA few outlets, such as Vox and Politico, have even suggested America is in the grip of a new \u201cRed Scare\u201d \u2014 as if Kirk\u2019s slaying and the countless assaults Antifa mobs have carried out on campuses and in America\u2019s cities are things that need to be exaggerated.\n\nOn the contrary: The violence speaks for itself, and its systematic character is easy to see.\n\nMost hard-left activists may not be planning murders \u2014 though just how many are doing so is something law enforcement must investigate vigorously.\n\nFor years, the FBI focused on right-wing extremism while violence from the other side escalated.\n\nEven when it stops short of murder, however, the intimidation campaign waged by the left relies on violence and the threat of violence.\n\nIt has three components.\n\nFirst there are those in the liberal elite who downplay violence in the name of any cause they deem righteous \u2014 remember CNN describing a George Floyd-related riot in 2020 as \u201cfiery but mostly peaceful\u201d? \u2014 while labeling Donald Trump, the MAGA movement and conservatives as fascists, threats to democracy and outright Nazis.\n\nFew of the columnists and pundits who employ this rhetoric dare to complete the thought, of course: If Trump really is Hitler, if Republican government means the end of democracy, then what follows?\n\nOn Facebook pages for \u201cOccupy Democrats\u201d (with 10 million followers) and \u201cU.S. Democratic Socialists\u201d (1.6 million followers), the message gets clearer: \u201cDear America: Whatever you wish the Germans had done in the 1930s, it\u2019s time to do that now.\u201d\n\nWouldn\u2019t that justify assassinating Hitler or other important Nazis?\n\nThe second level of the intimidation apparatus consists of people who translate the violent rhetoric into violent action, demonstrating that it\u2019s OK to punch a Nazi, when a Nazi is whoever an Antifa activist \u2014 or sophisticated liberal pundit \u2014 says is a Nazi.\n\nOther labels, too, authorize left-wing violence: transphobe, racist, settler-colonialist.\n\nActivists stirred up by this language menace everyone from the think-tank scholar Charles Murray to the independent gay reporter Andy Ngo.\n\nFirst Amendment rights to free speech and freedom of the press don\u2019t apply wherever Antifa and the intolerant left are given free rein.\n\nIntimidation doesn\u2019t just take the form of a mob like the one that inflicted a concussion on Allison Stanger, the Middlebury College professor who was set to moderate a debate with Murray back in 2017.\n\nIt also, and more insidiously, takes the form of college administrators granting the left a pre-emptive veto over campus speech.\n\nCowardly administrators claim a conservative speaker might draw violent protests, so they insist on heightened security and insurance \u2014 which they want the speakers or the student groups that host them to pay for.\n\nIf they can\u2019t pay this tax imposed by threats of left-wing violence, they can\u2019t speak \u2014 thus, effective Antifa censorship gets disguised as mere administrative concern for security.\n\nThe third component of the strategy to silence voices like Charlie Kirk\u2019s is the one that took his life.\n\nJust as the incendiary rhetoric of respectable liberals provides a framing and permission structure for literally incendiary acts of Antifa intimidation, the violent but usually less-than-lethal mayhem of the activist left sends a signal to bolder radicals.\n\nWhy settle for punching a Nazi when you can kill him?\n\nWhy cancel one speech when you can cancel the speaker forever?\n\nTyler Robinson wasn\u2019t forced to do what he did by media hype calling Charlie Kirk a fascist or by Antifa thugs showing it\u2019s possible to get away with hurting people.\n\nBut he surely wasn\u2019t discouraged by it.\n\nYes, free speech includes freedom for hateful speech.\n\nBut free speech can\u2019t exist at all without freedom from intimidation by the likes of Antifa.\n\nThose who act on liberals\u2019 violent rhetoric, whether by harassing speakers or by killing them, must be rooted out and punished.\n\nAs for Jimmy Kimmel and those who talk tough but don\u2019t dare lift a finger against \u201cfascism,\u201d they should be ashamed \u2014 and tuned out for good.\n\nDaniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review and editor-at-large of The American Conservative."

There is no body, no blood, no confession, and no witness.\n\nWith its unexplained central fact and its cast of characters from small-town southern France, the affair has become a social media sensation.\n\nSelf-declared investigators have set up countless chat groups where they swap theories and share testimony \u2013 much to the irritation of police and families.\n\n\"These groups are the equivalent of the bistro counter \u2013 but with more people,\" said psychoanalyst Patrick Avrane, author of a book on attitudes to crime.\n\n\"Everyone constructs the theory that suits him or her the best.\"\n\nThe Jubillar mystery began at the height of Covid lockdown when \u2013 in the early hours on 16 December 2020 \u2013 C\u00e9dric Jubillar contacted the gendarmes to report that his wife had gone missing.\n\nDelphine, who was 33 at the time, was a night nurse in a clinic not far from their home in Cagnac-les-Mines in the south-western Occitania region. The couple had two children, aged six and 18 months.\n\nPolice came to understand that the Jubillars did not have a happy relationship.\n\nC\u00e9dric Jubillar was a habitual cannabis user and barely held down a job. Delphine was in a relationship with a man she had met over the Internet. She and C\u00e9dric were talking about divorce.\n\nPolice and locals conducted extensive searches in the surrounding countryside \u2013 with potholers descending into some of the disused mineshafts with which the area is dotted.\n\nDelphine's body was never found, but a case was gradually built against her husband and in mid-2021 he was placed under investigation and detained.\n\nThe prosecution at the trial in the town of Albi will tell the court that C\u00e9dric Jubillar had a clear motivation to kill his wife, because of their impending split.\n\nLawyers will raise other points: certain odd actions by C\u00e9dric on the night of the disappearance; signs of a fight, including a pair of broken glasses; a neighbour who heard a woman screaming.\n\nC\u00e9dric Jubillar's own character will be brought under the spotlight, with witnesses expected who will speak of his threatening language to Delphine before she disappeared, and his apparent lack of concern after.\n\nTwo of his acquaintances \u2013 a former cellmate and a former girlfriend \u2013 will also repeat what they told police: that C\u00e9dric confessed to the murder and told them where her body was.\n\nBut after more digging no body has been found, and the defence is expected to raise doubts about the veracity of the pair's accounts.\n\nIndeed the heart of C\u00e9dric Jubillar's case is that there is nothing \u2013 beyond the popular view that he is the ideal culprit \u2013 to prove that he did away with his wife. He himself has always protested his innocence.\n\nThe trial is expected to last four weeks, with 65 witnesses called and 11 experts. More than 16,000 pages of evidence have been compiled.\n\nExplaining the case's grip on the public mind, writer Thibault de Montaigu said in Le Figaro newspaper it was like \"a novel by Georges Simenon\" \u2013 creator of the fictional detective Inspector Maigret.\n\nIn a long analysis of the case, he said that for all the circumstantial evidence against C\u00e9dric Jubillar, the central question was this: how a \"red-eyed, fuzzy-brained guy who smoked ten joints a day could have carried out the perfect crime?\n\n\"Killing his wife without leaving the slightest trace; secretly transporting her body, burying her in an unfindable location, then coming back to tell the police \u2013 all while his two children slept quietly in their bedrooms.\n\n\"And this was a guy who greeted the cops in panda pyjamas and then played Game of Thrones on his phone the very morning of the disappearance.\n\n\"So: genius bluffer; lucky fool; or poor innocent?\"\n\nThe court will decide."

Burgess, who spent significant time interviewing Erik Menendez, argued that understanding the trauma and fear that led to such violent acts is crucial for preventing future crimes, emphasizing that profiling is about understanding rather than excusing behavior. The piece highlights the complexity of criminal minds and the importance of learning from past cases to identify warning signs and intervene before violence occurs.",

                "text": "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This article contains graphic descriptions of homicide and assault. Please read with care.\n\nA month after Lyle and Erik Menendez were arrested for brutally slaying their parents inside their Beverly Hills home, Dr. Ann Burgess entered the Los Angeles County Jail with a stack of blank paper and a set of colored pencils.\n\nIt was April 1990, and the maelstrom around Jose and Kitty Menendez\u2019s double murder \u2013 and the brothers\u2019 forthcoming trial \u2013 had reached a fever pitch. News articles described the crime scene in gory, painstaking detail. Prosecutors and tabloids portrayed the brothers as greedy, calculated, cold-blooded killers.\n\nBut inside the jail\u2019s visitation room, Burgess recalls she politely asked the prison guards to remove Erik Menendez\u2019s handcuffs.\n\nThey hesitated before relenting.\n\nBurgess, a psychiatric clinical nurse specializing in working with victims of trauma and abuse, cut a petite frame which was offset by her large-rimmed glasses.\n\nShe had spent decades studying, profiling and ultimately helping investigators stop some of the country\u2019s most prolific offenders.\n\nThat expertise was why she was sitting across from Erik Menendez.\n\nShe had been hired by the defense team to uncover exactly what had happened on that bloody Sunday in 1989. And so, she asked Erik to start drawing.\n\nBurgess was among the earliest women to work with the FBI and a key member of what was known as the bureau\u2019s Behavioral Science Unit in the late \u201970s.\n\nThat team has since been dubbed \u201cMindhunters\u201d because they willingly delve into the darkest parts of the human psyche to better understand what motivates a murderer. What they uncover could make even the most hardened detectives blanch.\n\nAnd while criminal profiling is not an exact science, it is a method investigators increasingly lean on to identify warning signs of a would-be killer.\n\nCNN spoke to former profilers \u2013 all women like Dr. Burgess who worked with the FBI \u2013 who have pioneered and practiced ways to connect the dots between evidence and psychology to help solve and prevent crimes.\n\n\u201cYou start very slowly,\u201d the now 88-year-old told CNN of her approach with Menendez. \u201cYou start with, \u2018How far back can you remember?\u2019 \u2026 and gradually get up to, \u2018When did you first have this idea of what you wanted to do to your parents?\u2019\u201d\n\nBurgess said she spent 50 hours interviewing Menendez and, as she recounts in her latest book, she was later called as an \u201cexpert witness\u201d to testify about how Erik and Lyle\u2019s decision to confront their father over what they alleged was years of sexual abuse could have provoked enough fear for them to commit a double murder.\n\nShe\u2019s since been accused of profiling Menendez as a way to excuse or justify the brothers\u2019 crimes, but Burgess staunchly rejects that characterization.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do it for prevention,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to learn something from this.\u201d\n\nThat, she says, is the question that drives most criminal profilers: How can we prevent the next murder?\n\nThe search for a silver lining\n\nThe trial of Bryan Kohberger \u2013 the man who brutally murdered four University of Idaho students inside their off-campus home \u2013 ended in July before it ever truly began when he accepted a plea deal that saw him sentenced to four consecutive life terms in prison without the possibility of an appeal or parole.\n\nKohberger sat impassively throughout the hearing as the loved ones of each of the four students whose lives he so callously ended repeatedly asked him the same question: Why?\n\nAnd when he was finally given the opportunity to answer their questions, he said, \u201cI respectfully decline.\u201d\n\nThat decision further fueled the mystery around his motive for murdering Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Kaylee Goncalves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for these crimes that could approach anything resembling rationality,\u201d Idaho District Judge Steven Hippler said during Kohberger\u2019s sentencing. \u201cThe more we try to extract a reason, the more power and control we give to him.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, investigators and researchers may wish to study his actions \u2013 if only to learn how to prevent similar crimes from occurring in the future.\n\nIndeed, academics and former FBI profilers told CNN the challenge of unravelling the criminal mind of a man like Bryan Kohberger is enticing. And while his trial may be over, in many ways, the story of what can be learned from his crimes may have only just begun.\n\n\u201cWe want to squeeze any silver lining that we can out of these tragedies,\u201d said Molly Amman, a retired profiler who spent years leading the FBI\u2019s Behavioral Threat Assessment Center.\n\n\u201cThe silver lining is anything we can use to prevent another crime. It starts with learning absolutely, positively everything about the person and the crime that we possibly can.\u201d\n\nOnly Kohberger knows\n\nEven seasoned police officers who arrived at 1122 King Road on November 13, 2022, struggled to process the brutality of the crime scene.\n\nAll four victims had been ruthlessly stabbed to death before the attacker vanished through the kitchen\u2019s sliding glass door and into the night.\n\n\u201cThe female lying on the left half of the bed \u2026 was unrecognizable,\u201d one officer would later write of the attack that killed Kaylee Goncalves. \u201cI was unable to comprehend exactly what I was looking at while trying to discern the nature of the injuries.\u201d\n\nInitial interviews with the two surviving housemates gave investigators a loose timeline and a general description of the killer \u2013 an athletic, White male who wore a mask that covered most of his face \u2013 but little else.\n\nPolice later found a Ka-Bar knife sheath next to Madison\u2019s body that would prove to be critical in capturing her killer.\n\nOne of the surviving housemates told police about a month before the attacks, Kaylee saw \u201ca dark figure staring at her from the tree line when she took her dog Murphy out to pee.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been lighthearted talk and jokes made about a stalker in the past,\u201d the officer noted. \u201cAll the girls were slightly nervous about it being a fact, though.\u201d\n\nBut after years of investigating the murders, detectives told CNN they were never able to establish a connection between Kohberger and any of the victims, or a motive.\n\nKohberger is far from the first killer to deny families and survivors the catharsis that comes with confessing, in detail, to his crimes. But that, former FBI profilers tell CNN, is part of what makes the prospect of studying him infuriating and intriguing.\n\nOnly Kohberger knows why.\n\nJulia Cowley, a former FBI profiler who now hosts the true crime podcast, \u201cThe Consult,\u201d has another theory for Kohberger\u2019s courtroom silence: humiliation.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t outsmart people like he thought he would,\u201d she said. \u201cHe failed. And to talk about it, he\u2019s talking about something that could be what he considers a pretty deep personal failure.\u201d\n\nBesides, she added, more often than not, agents are tasked with crafting profiles without direct input from the killer. In those instances, she said, they let his actions speak for themselves.\n\nThat\u2019s the task Cowley said she faced when her team at the FBI set out to construct a profile of a serial offender who had eluded capture for nearly four decades:\n\nThe Golden State Killer.\n\nConnecting the dots\n\nCalifornia\u2019s suburbs were terrorized for years by a series of crimes that graduated from ransacking to rape and then murder.\n\nThe Visalia Ransacker. The East Area Rapist. The Original Night Stalker.\n\nAlthough investigators cycled through suspects and monikers, it turns out the crimes were all committed by the same man: The Golden State Killer.\n\nBut it would take decades for them to connect all the dots.\n\nHis first survivor would later tell the FBI she was startled from her sleep to find a man wearing a ski mask lurking in her bedroom doorway. He swiftly pounced on her bed, slashed her face with a knife, and tied her hands behind her back, she said.\n\nThen, the assault began. It was June 18, 1976.\n\n\u201cAfter it was all over and done with, he went through the stuff in the room, took money out of my purse \u2026 and took a piece of jewelry,\u201d the survivor told the bureau in a 2016 interview.\n\nShe lay there for hours after he disappeared, too scared to move in case her attacker was still nearby. Between 1976 and 1986, California investigators searched in vain for the suspect behind 12 homicides, 45 rapes, and 120 burglaries, according to the FBI.\n\nBut then, the murders abruptly stopped, and the cases remained unsolved for more than 40 years.\n\nIn 2011, investigators in Sacramento reached out to the BAU to construct a new criminal profile of the man who would come to be known as the Golden State Killer.\n\nAs the lead profiler on the case, Cowley said she and her team spent countless hours poring over police reports, timelines and victim interviews. And soon, they began to notice patterns.\n\nThe killer would often steal an earring from the pair and didn\u2019t seem to solely target items of value. Then, as the assaults escalated to homicides, Cowley said his behavior led many on the team to suspect he had a background in law enforcement.\n\nThe suspect would often use a flashlight to blind his victims, she said, and he seemed comfortable putting them in restraints.\n\n\u201cHe was able to escalate directly to deadly force without hesitation,\u201d she recalled to CNN. \u201cWhen he was met with resistance, it didn\u2019t seem to faze him when he used a weapon.\u201d\n\nThe proposed connection between a prolific offender and the police rankled some within the bureau, Cowley said, including her supervisor, who directed her to revise their conclusion.\n\n\u201cI did end up telling investigators that we believed he had some sort of \u2018formal firearms training,\u2019\u201d she said of the team\u2019s final report.\n\nBut it was the suspect\u2019s more idiosyncratic behaviors that would ultimately prove to be his downfall. Over time, the team concluded the ransacking and burglaries were just as important to the suspect as the assaults and homicides, she said.\n\nAnd that put her in mind of another elusive offender: The Visalia Ransacker.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the tiny farming town of Visalia, California, was plagued by a serial ransacker and rapist. Cowley said investigators had dismissed the possible connection between the culprit in Visalia and the East Area Rapist, who began operating around the same time, because the composite sketches and descriptions from survivors did not match.\n\nStill, \u201cI just saw many behaviors that just seemed too similar to not be connected,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Ransacker would construct makeshift alarms by placing objects on doorknobs. If someone came home, the objects would crash, alerting him to their presence. He also frequently stole one earring from the pair, and it appeared important to him that his victims knew he had been there \u2013 in one instance, Cowley said, he poured orange juice all over a bed.\n\nAnd those bizarre behaviors also mirrored the East Area Rapist. He seemed to enjoy terrorizing couples, and he would break in and tie up his victims.\n\nThen, \u201che often spent hours in the home. He would eat their food, he would go through their cabinets, he was very loud, gulping things \u2013 making his presence very known,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe did things like put fragile objects on the backs of the male victims \u2013 cups and saucer dishes, things like that \u2013 so if the victims moved, the items would fall and break,\u201d she added.\n\nIn 1975, a college professor named Claude Snelling was shot and killed in Visalia while trying to stop a gunman from kidnapping his teenage daughter.\n\nCowley said she was convinced the unsolved case was the Golden State Killer\u2019s first homicide.\n\nSo, she and her team generated a profile of the killer based on the investigator\u2019s evidence. They also performed what the FBI calls a \u201clinkage analysis,\u201d detailing all the ways the Visalia Ransacker and the East Area Rapist\u2019s crimes could be connected.\n\nAnd although it didn\u2019t immediately point to a culprit, Cowley said it would ultimately help investigators find a break in the case.\n\n\u201cProfiling doesn\u2019t identify offenders, and it doesn\u2019t solve crimes. It helps to inform investigators \u2026 It helps to perhaps prioritize suspects,\u201d she said.\n\nOn April 24, 2018, Sacramento police arrested Joseph James DeAngelo and charged him with 13 counts of first-degree murder and 13 felony counts of kidnapping.\n\nHe did not face charges for rape because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nBut Cowley and her team had been right about his law enforcement background \u2013 DeAngelo was a former California police officer and Vietnam War veteran.\n\nNow 79, DeAngelo was captured, in part, because investigators matched DNA found at the crime scenes against DNA they\u2019d found on the handle of a car door and a tissue in his garbage can.\n\n\u201cBecause (we\u2019d) linked certain crimes together, when (investigators) did the forensic genetic genealogy, they had more data points,\u201d Cowley said. \u201cSo, they were able to identify him sooner than they would have.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, DeAngelo pleaded guilty to 26 counts of murder and kidnapping and admitted to a further 161 crimes connected to 61 victims.\n\nWhen she learned of his plea, Cowley said her first thought was of the investigators she\u2019d worked with over the years.\n\n\u201cThere had been so many times in the past where they thought they had the suspect,\u201d she said. \u201cSo many of the investigators were very close with the victims and their families and I just thought about all the emotions that must be running through everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just happy and relieved that there was an answer \u2013 that it was going to be resolved.\u201d\n\n\u2018The business of prevention\u2019\n\nBut a profiler\u2019s ultimate \u2013 and most elusive \u2013 goal is to recognize behavioral patterns and stop a crime before it even starts.\n\nThat was Molly Amman\u2019s job at the Behavioral Threat Assessment Center within the FBI. Though she has since retired from the bureau and now works as a private consultant, Amman said that goal has never wavered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the business of prevention,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I do is try to assess, mitigate and prevent acts of targeted violence.\u201d\n\nAmman said her work focused on researching, analyzing and training the community to spot what the FBI calls \u201cpre-attack behaviors\u201d \u2013 the sometimes-subtle warning signs that a person could soon commit an act of violence.\n\nOver the past four or so decades, Amman said, researchers have assembled \u201ca picture of what we think more or less captures the universe of known pre-attack behaviors.\u201d\n\nWhether it\u2019s a stalker, an active shooter, or a family annihilator, Amman said criminology researchers and the FBI have found that behaviors \u2013 like fixating on a perceived grievance or potential victim, or informing a third party of the intent to commit a violent crime \u2013 \u201chold true across multiple contexts of murder.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo now that we understand that, we are out training police departments and security people and school professionals \u2013 whoever we can get \u2013 on these pre-attack warning behaviors and what they mean.\u201d\n\nWhen a person of concern is flagged to law enforcement or consultants like Amman, they quickly assess the risk of imminent violence and look for ways to intervene to manage or reduce the threat, she said.\n\n\u201cThe devil is in the details,\u201d she said. \u201cSome warning behaviors are more closely correlated with violence and even imminence of violence than others, and so that\u2019s where your training comes into play.\u201d\n\nOptions for intervention range from monitoring the person or hardening a target like a school, Amman said, or, in more extreme cases, invoking red flag laws or involuntarily committing someone.\n\nBut always, the goal is to intervene and interrupt the ramp-up to violence. And success is often inconspicuous.\n\n\u201cYour next question might be, \u2018Well, how many times has that prevented violence?\u2019 And my answer is always going to be, \u2018I don\u2019t know because we can\u2019t prove what never happened,\u2019\u201d Amman said.\n\n\u201cMy experience has been that \u2026 if we can identify those behaviors and recognize that this is someone who needs assistance \u2026 then we can change the course of events.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nNot excusing, understanding\n\nWhen she first met Erik Menendez, Burgess would later say how she was intrigued by the fact that he did not seem to fit the typical profile of what she describes as a \u201ccold-blooded killer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a line people cross when they commit something horrific. It changes them,\u201d she writes in \u201cExpert Witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Erik had none of that. He was different.\u201d\n\nBurgess would come to attribute that difference to the trauma Menendez and his brother say they experienced, claiming years of being sexually abused by their father.\n\nThat day in April 1990, as Erik sketched crude stick figures of his family\u2019s life, Burgess says Menendez told her that \u2013 mere days before the murders \u2013 he and Lyle had confronted their parents about their father\u2019s alleged sexual abuse and molestation. They later testified that they feared for their lives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let you touch my little brother \u2026 ever \u2026 again,\u201d Burgess says Menendez scrawled beneath a hastily scribbled drawing of Lyle and \u201cDad.\u201d\n\nThen, \u201calmost as if in a trance,\u201d he mimed lifting a shotgun and opening fire.\n\nDuring the first trial, Burgess\u2019 testimony about the combined effects that sexual abuse, trauma and fear can have on both the mind and body helped underpin the defense team\u2019s \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d argument.\n\nThe brothers thought their lives were in danger after confronting their parents, their lawyer argued, and so they conspired to commit a murder.\n\n\u201cObviously, it resonated with half of the jury, because that\u2019s the way they voted,\u201d Burgess said. \u201cThe women felt that the brothers were scared and felt that something was going to happen to them, whereas the men were just the opposite.\u201d\n\nThe first Menendez trial ended with a hung jury. During the retrial, Judge Stanley Weisberg made the consequential decision to limit testimony about sexual abuse and prohibit the use of the \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d strategy.\n\nLyle and Erik Menendez were both convicted of first-degree murder and have spent more than 35 years behind bars. Last month, they were denied parole.\n\nIn hindsight, some culprits seem obvious.\n\nKohberger\u2019s classmates described him as \u201ccreepy\u201d and \u201cdomineering.\u201d He became known on campus for his unblinking stares, and multiple female students told investigators he would follow them after class.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a sort of picture painted of him, of a controlled, sort of quietly narcissistic, mildly exploitive kind of guy,\u201d Amman said.\n\nAnd yet, the gruesome attacks on King Road were the exact opposite.\n\n\u201cOnce he got in their bedroom, I would not call those crimes terribly controlled \u2013 they were quite savage,\u201d Amman said.\n\nThe contradiction, she added, speaks to a deeper truth about the human condition \u2013 we\u2019re all far more nuanced and complicated than we seem \u2013 and that\u2019s why criminal profiling is key.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about excusing, it\u2019s about understanding,\u201d Amman said. \u201cI can understand it, and that is what gives me the power to do what I do, which is to try to stop them, catch them or prevent them.\u201d\n\nInevitably, Burgess said, after the battery of lawyers have disappeared and the camera lights have faded, the reality of life in prison sets in for many convicts.\n\nThat, she said, is when a killer like Bryan Kohberger will be primed to speak.\n\nAnd he may provide a detail that could help stop the next killer.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time a mass murderer has carried out a plan,\u201d Burgess said.\n\n\u201cYou want to compare this with other cases to see, \u2018Where could he have been stopped earlier?\u201d"

                "text": "Suffolk County prosecutors can use high-tech DNA evidence against accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann \u2013 who will face just one trial for the murders of seven sex workers, a Long Island judge said in a bombshell ruling Tuesday.\n\nThe decision by Judge Tim Mazzei is a slam dunk for Suffolk County DA Ray Tierney, whose case against Heuermann hinges largely on DNA.\n\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t confident in this case I would\u2019ve never brought it to trial,\u201d Tierney told reporters.\n\nHeuermann\u2019s lawyer, Michael Brown, had challenged the DNA evidence and sought to have his client tried separately for each of the seven sex workers he is accused of killing.\n\nMazzei ruled earlier this month that crucial DNA evidence could be used in the case against the 61-year-old accused serial killer \u2013 which Brown challenged, leading to Tuesday\u2019s ruling.\n\nThe DNA matches link Heuermann to seven sex workers found dead along a desolate stretch of Long Island \u2013 Valerie Mack, 24, Melissa Taylor, 20, Megan Waterman, 22, Melissa Barthelemy, 24, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, Sandra Costilla, 28, and Amber Lynn Costello, 27.\n\nThe bodies were dumped between 1993 and 2010, but the murders remain unsolved until former NYPD bigwig Rodney Harrison took over as Suffolk County police commissioner and reopened the case \u2013 leading to Heuermann\u2019s arrest in July 2023.\n\nInvestigators then carried out two thorough searches of the Heuermann home in Massapequa Park, which led to the alleged discovery of a grisly \u201cplanning document\u201d allegedly kept by the accused killer, including a \u201clessons learned\u201d section.\n\n\u201cI think a big consideration by the court, which was stated in their decision, was that planning document,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cThat planning document talks about murders that had occurred, that are about to occur and that are going to occur in the future.\u201d\n\nThe hulking architect, who has denied he was behind the grisly slayings, has since been held without bail while the case crawls toward a trial.\n\nBrown has called the DNA evidence \u201cmagic,\u201d and moved to have it thrown out while asking that each of the murders be the subject of separate trials.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not making motions for the sake of making motions,\u201d he said outside the courtroom. \u201cWe\u2019re making motions because we are confident in the law and confident in our position.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we do not make the decision,\u201d he said.\n\nThe DNA evidence, processed by Astrea Labs, was tested using high-tech science that allowed damaged samples to be used for the first time in a New York State courtroom.\n\nBrown argued on Sept. 3 that the lab is not licensed in the state and that using the evidence would violate Empire State health laws.\n\nMeanwhile Tierney said he plans to call \u201cwell over\u201d 100 witnesses from 15 different states to testify at the upcoming trial, with more than 6.5 million documents entered into evidence.\n\nBrown called the 100 terabytes of evidence \u201ca mountain of a mountain.\n\n\u201cYou got to remember we\u2019re talking about 30 years of investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about seven victims.

                "text": "A bull moose that fell into an abandoned well in Maine was pulled to safety during an elaborate five-hour rescue.\n\nThe operation happened on Wednesday after Cole Brown, whose family owns the forested land in the northern Maine community of Pembroke, spotted a pair of antlers. He heard a noise and initially thought it was turkeys but, upon, closer inspection, realized it was something a lot bigger.\n\n\u201cHe walks over and, through the thick alders and bushes, he saw the antlers \u2013 just the antlers peeking out,\u201d said Delaney Gardner, Brown\u2019s stepsister, who videotaped the rescue. \u201cHe knew that an animal of that size, he was going to need some backup just in case it was, you know, injured or just stuck there.\u201d\n\nThe family alerted the Maine department of inland fisheries and wildlife, which sent a biologist who sedated the moose. Then wardens put straps on the animal and, using an excavator provided by the family, gingerly lifted the moose out of the 9ft-deep well.\n\n\u201cOnce the sedation wore off, the moose took off running, no worse for wear other than perhaps his bruised ego,\u201d the agency said on its Facebook page.\n\nGardner said the successful rescue left her with a mix of \u201crelief and happiness\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is a majestic giant animal in such a precarious situation,\u201d she said. \u201cSo to be able to see everyone come together in all these different ways that they needed to was absolutely incredible. And then seeing it work out was just so satisfying and heartwarming.\u201d\n\nGardner said the family didn\u2019t know the well \u2013 which is likely decades old \u2013 was on their 100 acres (40 hectares) of land until the moose fell into it. Since then, they have capped the well and are considering their options, including digging it out and utilizing it since there may be a water source nearby.\n\n\u201cFor now it\u2019s covered and no more animals or people will be falling into it,\u201d she said."

Speaking at the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce, in Providence, Rhode Island, on Tuesday, Powell said a sharp cooldown of hiring over the summer had shifted the balance of risks toward greater concern over the labor market.\n\n\"The downside risks to employment have risen,\" Powell said.\n\nThe remarks came days after the Fed cut interest rates for the first time this year in an effort to boost hiring. \u200b\u200bThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), a policymaking body at the Fed, projected two additional quarter-point rate cuts over the remainder of 2025.\n\nStill, Powell voiced concern about the trajectory for prices, saying \"uncertainty around the path of inflation remains high.\"\n\n\"Two-sided risk mean there is no-risk free path,\" Powell added.\n\nThe central bank last week delivered a policy long-sought by President Donald Trump, though the size of the rate cut fell short of a larger reduction preferred by Trump.\n\nThe announcement marked a flashpoint in the monthslong pressure campaign directed at the Fed by Trump.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has moved to fire one member of the Fed's board of governors and secure Senate confirmation for another. Both officials were among the 12 policymakers who cast votes on the interest-rate decision, though their status remained uncertain days before the Fed meeting.\n\nThe race to reshape the Fed comes after Trump railed for months against the central bank and Powell for declining to heed his call for lower interest rates. Last week, Powell said the Fed remains \"strongly committed to maintaining our independence.\"\n\nStephen Miran, a top White House economic advisor who joined the Fed board last week, cast the lone dissenting vote. Miran voted in favor of a larger half-point rate cut.\n\nTrump recently moved to fire board member Lisa Cook, who sued Trump over her attempted ouster, saying the decision violated her legal protections as an employee at the independent federal agency. Trump said he removed Cook over mortgage fraud allegations against her, which Cook has denied.\n\nLast week, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Fed to let Cook continue serving in her role as a governor of the Federal Reserve System as her lawsuit moves through the courts. The Trump administration appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn recent months, the economy has suffered a sharp hiring slowdown alongside a rise of inflation, setting the conditions for what economists call \"stagflation.\"\n\nThe economic conditions have put Fed policymakers in a bind. If the Fed raises interest rates as a means of protecting against tariff-induced inflation, it risks tipping the economy into a downturn. On the other hand, if the Fed lowers rates to stimulate the economy in the face of a hiring slowdown, it threatens to boost spending and worsen inflation."

That would bring the Fed\u2019s key interest rate to its lowest level since October 2022.\n\nPowell reiterated Tuesday much of what he told reporters during a news conference after the Fed\u2019s latest decision on September 17, but indicated that there is no crisis requiring further rate cuts, especially large ones.\n\nStill, Fed policymakers remain in a bind. President Donald Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs are pushing up some prices while job growth hits a lull \u2014 putting both sides of the Fed\u2019s dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment under stress.\n\n\u201cTwo-sided risks mean that there is no risk-free path,\u201d Powell said.\n\nThe calls for aggressive cuts\n\nSince the Fed\u2019s decision last week, two members of the Fed\u2019s powerful Board of Governors, both Trump appointees, have publicly expressed concern about the US labor market while playing down the potential impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on prices.\n\nFed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman on Tuesday said \u201crecent\n\ndata have revealed a materially more fragile labor market\u201d and that \u201ctariffs will have only a small and short-lived effect on inflation going forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my view, the recent data, including the estimated payroll employment benchmark revisions, show that we are at serious risk of already being behind the curve in addressing deteriorating labor market conditions,\u201d she said at an event in Asheville, North Carolina. \u201cShould these conditions continue, I am concerned that we will need to adjust policy at a faster pace and to a larger degree going forward.\u201d\n\nAccording to Labor Department data, job growth in recent months has been tepid as the number of unemployed people seeking work now exceeds demand for workers, though the unemployment rate remains relatively low, at 4.3%.\n\nOn Monday, Fed Governor Stephen Miran, one of Trump\u2019s top economic advisers on an unpaid leave to serve at the Fed, said in his first speech as a monetary policymaker that the consensus view among economists underestimates how much pressure interest rates are putting on the labor market.\n\n\u201cI view policy as very restrictive, (and) believe it poses material risks to the Fed\u2019s employment mandate,\u201d Miran said. He argued that the so-called neutral rate of interest, which is a theoretical level of borrowing costs that neither stimulates nor dampens economic activity, is actually lower than most economists understand.\n\nIn Miran\u2019s view, that means the Fed\u2019s key interest rate should be \u201calmost 2 percentage points lower.\u201d That would mean eight quarter-point rate cuts, or four half-point cuts. The Fed typically only delivers large rate cuts in times of economic trouble.\n\nSome Fed officials are on the fence\n\nSome Fed officials aren\u2019t convinced that aggressive rate cuts in the coming months are necessary.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who votes on policy moves this year, said that inflation remains a problem for the Fed because it hasn\u2019t fully returned to its 2% target yet.\n\n\u201cEventually, at a gradual pace, rates can come down a fair amount if we can get this stagflationary dust out of the air,\u201d Goolsbee said. \u201cBut with inflation having been over the target for four and a half years in a row, and rising, I think we need to be a little careful with getting overly up-front aggressive.\u201d\n\nThe Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index \u2014 rose 0.2% in July from the prior month, which kept the annual rate unchanged at 2.6%. The Commerce Department on Friday releases August PCE data.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal that published Monday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who isn\u2019t a voter on the central bank\u2019s policy committee this year, said that \u201cthe risk to the price-stability mandate is still the most significant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe get signs from our contacts and from our surveys that prices are likely to still go up some more from here. So we\u2019re going to see some upward movement in inflation,\u201d Bostic said.\n\n\u201cI worry about that,\u201d he added."

After all, it doesn\u2019t pay a dividend or a coupon, and over the very long term, it\u2019s struggled to compete with other asset returns,\u201d Henry Allen, vice president and macro strategist at Deutsche, said in a note to clients.\n\nAnxiety around President Trump\u2019s tariffs and their potential to cause inflation, stubbornly high interest rates, a weaker US dollar, a possible government shutdown and a slow labor market have all contributed to gold\u2019s explosive rise this year.\n\nMeanwhile, central bankers around the world have continued to buy up gold en masse despite record-breaking prices \u2013 likely a cautionary move linked to the Russia-Ukraine war and the war in Gaza. Central bankers typically ramp up their gold reserves during geopolitical crises.\n\nSome 85% of central bankers said gold\u2019s performance during tumultuous times was either highly or somewhat relevant to their gold portfolio, with 71% citing it as a hedge against geopolitical risks, according to a World Gold Council survey this year.\n\nSome 95% of central bankers expect global gold reserves to increase this year, according to the survey.\n\nThe Federal Reserve cut interest rates earlier this month for the first time since December 2024 by a quarter point. It\u2019s expected to issue another cut sometime this year.\n\nA lower interest rate typically leads to lower Treasury yields. That makes gold, which doesn\u2019t pay interest, an even more attractive asset, so gold could continue to climb this year."

                "text": "In the spy romance series Tempest, Jun Ji-hyun, one of South Korea's biggest stars, plays a diplomat trying to uncover the truth behind a deadly assassination.\n\n\"Why does China prefer war? A nuclear bomb could fall near the border,\" her character says in one episode of the new Disney+ series.\n\nThis fictional scene led to real consequences over the weekend, with many Chinese social media users taking it to be a malicious mischaracterisation of China as belligerent. Many are now calling for brands to sever ties with the Korean actress.\n\nThe uproar has also reignited debate over an unofficial Chinese ban on South Korean entertainment, which has been in place for nearly a decade.\n\nWhile China has never admitted to a ban, the abrupt dearth of K-content since 2016 is widely believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region.\n\nThings had appeared to be easing in recent months, with a few South Korean performers holding concerts in China. But the controversy over Tempest has triggered a fresh wave of support for the ban.\n\n\"Keep the K-drama ban to the death, thank you,\" reads one Weibo comment liked by 10,000 users.\n\nWhile much of the anger has coalesced around Jun's line about China, social media users have also dug up other examples from the series which they view as offensive.\n\nFor example, scenes meant to portray China's Dalian city feature a bunch of dilapidated buildings, believed to be shot in Hong Kong, which some people say paints China in a bad light.\n\nIn another scene, a group of people are seated at a table set on a red carpet with yellow stars, which social media users say resembles the Chinese flag.\n\nWhen Jun recited an ancient Chinese poem in another instance, viewers criticised what they viewed as her wonky accent.\n\nAll this has led to a concerted effort against Jun on Weibo, where users are pressuring brands to punish her.\n\nAccording to sharp-eyed Weibo users, American skincare brand La Mer, French luxury brand Louis Vuitton and Swiss watchmaker Piaget have all scrubbed Jun from their social media accounts.\n\n\"Besides removing Jun Ji-hyun advertisements, quickly terminate her contracts globally. Otherwise we'll boycott LV forever,\" reads one comment on Louis Vuitton's Weibo account.\n\nJun's agency told local news outlet MBC on Tuesday that the actress's brand campaigns were \"unrelated\" to Tempest and had ended before the show's release.\n\nChinese consumers are known to harness their massive spending power in pressure campaigns when they perceive insults to Chinese national pride.\n\nBrands from Swedish fashion giant H&M to Japanese clothing chain Uniqlo and most recently Swatch - for an ad featuring an allegedly racist gesture - have all found themselves the target of such boycott campaigns.\n\nSome people have come to Jun's defence, arguing that she was not the one who wrote the controversial line.\n\n\"Jun Ji-hyun is just an actor. It is impossible for her to understand the history of a country, the emotions of the people, and the intricate relationships between countries before making a movie,\" one Weibo user wrote, blaming the incident on the \"ignorance\" of the show's crew and writers.\n\nBut such sentiments have been drowned out by heated opposition. \"Even a washing machine can't whitewash something as well as you,\" reads a comment to the post.\n\n\"She isn't a small-time actor. She has a choice of script, she can read the script! Who can force a popular star to do this?\" another wrote.\n\nJun swept to stardom with the 2001 rom-com My Sassy Girl, which took Asia by storm and established her as a noughties 'it girl'. Since then, she has found enduring success with her roles, from the 2013 fantasy romance series My Love from the Star, to the 2021 Netflix thriller Kingdom.\n\nBut like many other South Korean celebrities, she has been conspicuously missing from China's entertainment scene since the 2016 ban.\n\nOptimism had surrounded a lifting of the ban earlier this year, as bilateral ties appeared to be warming.\n\nIn March, South Korea's foreign ministry said that the two countries' foreign ministers agreed to work on restoring cultural exchanges. The following month, South Korean hip-hop band Homies became the first all-Korean group to perform in mainland China in nearly a decade.\n\nBut it's hard to say how much K-pop and K-dramas will be let back into what was once its biggest market.\n\nIn May, K-pop boy band Epex was slated to perform in Fuzhou, in what would have been a landmark concert for K-pop in China. But their show was cancelled weeks before the event, with their management agency citing \"local circumstances\".\n\nLast week, when asked about the postponement of another concert in Hainan province that was set to feature multiple K-pop groups, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China did not oppose \"beneficial cultural exchanges\" with South Korea.\n\nOver the last decade, China has proven to be a pop culture juggernaut in its own right, capable of keeping its population of 1.3 billion entertained with homegrown media. And for many Chinese viewers, the ongoing controversy surrounding Tempest has given them another reason to steer away from K-content.\n\n\"It's already 2025 and you're still watching K-dramas, how tacky!\" wrote a Weibo user."

                "text": "My three boys starved to death. I hope angels bring them home, says Afghan mother\n\n2 days ago\n\nYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondent\n\nGusts of wind blew dust up off the ground as Ghulam Mohiddin and his wife Nazo walked towards the graveyard where all their children are buried.\n\nThey showed us the graves of the three boys they lost in the past two years \u2013 one-year-old Rahmat, seven-month-old Koatan and most recently, three-month-old Faisal Ahmad.\n\nAll three suffered from malnutrition, say Ghulam and Nazo.\n\n\"Can you imagine how painful it's been for me to lose three children? One minute there's a baby in your arms, the next minute they are empty,\" says Nazo.\n\n\"I hope every day that angels would somehow put my babies back in our home.\"\n\n'Three million children in peril'\n\nThere are days the couple go without food. They break walnut shells for a living in the Sheidaee settlement just outside the city of Herat in western Afghanistan and receive no help from the Taliban government or from NGOs.\n\n\"Watching helplessly as my children cried out of hunger, it felt like my body was erupting in flames. It felt like someone was cutting me into half with a saw from my head to my feet,\" said Ghulam.\n\nThe deaths of their children are not recorded anywhere, but it's evidence of a silent wave of mortality engulfing Afghanistan's youngest, as the country is pushed into what the UN calls an unprecedented crisis of hunger.\n\n\"We started the year with the highest increase in child malnutrition ever recorded in Afghanistan. But things have got worse from there,\" says John Aylieff, the World Food Programme's country director.\n\n\"Food assistance kept a lid in this country on hunger and malnutrition, particularly for the bottom five million who really can't cope without international support. That lid has now been lifted. The soaring of the malnutrition is placing the lives of more than three million children in peril.\"\n\nAid has sharply declined because the single largest donor, the US, stopped nearly all aid to Afghanistan earlier this year. But WFP says eight or nine other donors who funded them in the last two years have also stopped this year, and many others are giving much less than they were last year.\n\nOne reason is donors are responding to a number of crises around the world. But the Taliban government's policies also affect how much the world is willing to help.\n\nWhat are they doing to help their citizens?\n\n\"Those who are facing malnutrition, those who are facing hunger, it's because of sanctions, because of aid cuts by international organisations. It's not because of the government,\" the head of the Taliban's political office in Doha, Suhail Shaheen, told the BBC.\n\n\"The government has expanded its assistance to the people and is doing what is in its capacity, But our budget is based on internal revenues, and we are facing sanctions.\"\n\nBut the Taliban's intransigence on women's rights affects its bid for international recognition, and for the sanctions against it to be lifted. Other decisions, like the recent enforcement of a previously announced ban on Afghan women working for NGOs is putting the delivery of \"life-saving humanitarian assistance at serious risk\", the UN says.\n\nThe malnutrition emergency is compounded by other factors too \u2013 a severe drought that has affected agricultural incomes in more than half of Afghanistan's provinces, and the forced return of more than two million Afghans from Iran and Pakistan, reducing the remittances they send back.\n\n'Hungry all the time'\n\nAt the Sheidaee graveyard we found startling evidence of child deaths. There were no records of the people buried there, so we counted the graves ourselves. Roughly two-thirds of the hundreds of graves were of children \u2013 it was easy to tell the small graves from the bigger ones.\n\nVillagers told us the graveyard is relatively new, between two to three years old. They also confirmed that it was not a specific graveyard for children.\n\nAs we walked through the settlement in Sheidaee, people came out carrying their children. Rahila was carrying Hibatullah who, at two, cannot stand up. Durkhanee brought out her son Mohammad Yusuf, who's also nearly two and unable to stand.\n\nNearly half of all Afghan children under the age of five are stunted, the UN says.\n\nIn one of the mud and clay homes, Hanifa Sayedi's one-year-old son Rafiullah could barely hold himself up, even while he's sitting.\n\n\"I took him to a clinic where they told me he's malnourished, but I don't have the money to keep taking him there,\" she says. She and her husband have two other children, and dry pieces of bread with Afghan green tea are the only meals the family can afford. Some days they don't eat.\n\nRafiullah doesn't have teeth yet, so Hanifa soaks the bread in the tea and feeds him.\n\n\"But it's not enough and he's hungry all the time. To make him sleep, I give him these medicines,\" she says, pulling out two strips of tablets.\n\nOne is a strip of Lorazepam, an anti-anxiety medicine, the other is Propanolol, a drug that controls high blood pressure. One strip costs 10 Afghani ($0.15; \u00a30.13) the same amount as one piece of bread. Hanifa says she bought them at a pharmacy, saying she wanted sleeping pills for herself.\n\n\"I feel so guilty that my children are going hungry and I can't do much. I feel suffocated and like I should kill my children and myself,\" she says.\n\nDoctors say that when given to young children, drugs such as these can damage the child's heart, kidneys and liver, and can even be life-threatening if given for a prolonged period of time.\n\nHanifa's is one of millions of pleas for help.\n\n\"It's incredibly heartbreaking to be in this country and watch this unfold. WFP has a hotline. We've had to retrain our call operators because we're getting a much higher proportion of calls from women threatening suicide because they're desperate and they just don't know how to feed their children any more,\" says WFP's John Aylieff.\n\nThe closure of food assistance to communities like those in Sheidaee and in other parts of Afghanistan has meant that more children are being pushed into severe acute malnutrition.\n\nWe've seen evidence of this in hospitals across Afghanistan.\n\nIn the malnutrition ward of the Badakhshan regional hospital in the north-east, there were 26 children in 12 beds.\n\nThree-month-old Sana, the youngest baby on the ward, has malnutrition, acute diarrhoea and a cleft lip. She is her mother Zamira's second baby. The first child, another baby girl, died when she was 20 days old.\n\n\"I'm scared this child might also meet the same fate. I'm tired of this life. It's not worth living,\" says Zamira, with a stricken look on her face.\n\nAs Zamira speaks, Sana's hands and feet turn blue. Her tiny heart is not pumping enough blood. A nurse puts her on oxygen.\n\nIn another cot is five-month-old Musleha, who has malnutrition and measles. Her mother Karima says she's hardly opened her eyes in the past few days.\n\n\"She's in pain and I don't know what to do. We are poor and don't have access to nutritious food. That's why she's in this state,\" says Karima.\n\nIn the cot next to Musleha, are twins Mutehara and Maziyan. The baby girls also have malnutrition and measles, and are half the weight they should be at 18 months. Mutehara lets out a feeble cry. It's evident she's in pain.\n\n'We simply cannot afford to feed them'\n\nThis isn't the first time we've documented child deaths from malnutrition in Afghanistan, but this is the worst we've ever seen.\n\nWithin a span of a week, three babies from one ward became the latest casualties of Afghanistan's crisis of hunger.\n\nAnd it's about to get worse.\n\n\"WFP's humanitarian funding will run out in November. At the moment, we are starting to turn away malnourished women and children from the health centres because we simply cannot afford to feed them. In November, we will stop unless we get a further injection of funding,\" says John Aylieff.\n\nWith winter approaching, it is hard to overstate the urgency of the disaster unfolding in Afghanistan.\n\nAdditional reporting Mahfouz Zubaide, Aakriti Thapar, Sanjay Ganguly"

Her surviving twin\u2019s fate now hinges in part on decisions made thousands of miles away in Washington, DC.\n\nUsman and her family are sheltering in a camp for displaced people in northeastern Nigeria\u2019s Borno state, where the Boko Haram terror group first emerged.\n\nDuring her eight years at Fulatari camp in the town of Dikwa \u2013 a refuge for those fleeing Boko Haram \u2013 six of her 13 children have died. Usman, 40, told CNN her most recent loss was in March, just days after a US-funded nutrition program that had provided therapeutic food packets to her malnourished twins was abruptly halted.\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration froze foreign aid and cut support for programs aid groups deemed lifesaving \u2013 decisions that quickly turned into life-or-death realities for families like Usman\u2019s. The nutrition program in Dikwa, which was funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), received a sudden stop-work order during the administration\u2019s aid freeze, according to the nonprofit that implemented the work, Mercy Corps.\n\nIn March, UNICEF warned that critical nutrition supplies for acutely malnourished children were rapidly dwindling in Nigeria and Ethiopia. The agency cautioned that nearly 1.3 million children under the age of five in conflict-affected northeastern Nigeria and Ethiopia\u2019s drought-stricken Afar region could lose access to treatment this year, heightening their risk of death as funding is removed.\n\nThe impact of these funding cuts is forecast to be felt elsewhere in Africa too. In August, Save the Children reported that millions of malnourished children in Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan and other countries will also be affected.\n\nLast month, the United Nations\u2019 World Food Programme (WFP) raised similar alarms, warning that its funding from international donors was \u201cdrying up,\u201d forcing it to reduce food and nutrition assistance to hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people in northeastern Nigeria \u2013 children, in particular.\n\nIt added that more than 150 nutrition clinics it supported in the region were at risk of closure.\n\nA US State Department spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday that US-funded food assistance to internally displaced people and communities in Nigeria\u2019s Borno state had resumed. Aid workers have said that projects resumed at a lower capacity, with significant reductions to the work being carried out.\n\nAsked about broader cuts to food assistance programs, the State Department spokesperson said the US had recently provided $93 million to help nearly one million children suffering from malnutrition in 13 countries, including Kenya and South Sudan, and was also giving $52 million to the WFP for emergency food aid.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to remember that the American taxpayer was never meant to bear the full burden of taking care of every person on Earth \u2013 whether that be with food, medicine, or otherwise. Despite this, America continues to be the most generous nation in the world,\u201d a State Department spokesperson told CNN.\n\n\u201cThis Administration is significantly enhancing the efficiency and strategic impact of foreign assistance programs and continues to deliver life-saving assistance around the world.\u201d\n\n\u2018The babies died of hunger\u2019\n\nRoughly 5.4 million children under 5 in Nigeria\u2019s northeast and northwest suffer from acute malnutrition, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an international food-security body that tracks global hunger crises. Of these children, around 1.8 million face severe acute malnutrition, it said.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, approximately 787,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women are acutely malnourished,\u201d the IPC report, released last year, stated.\n\nUsman\u2019s twin boys were among more than 55,000 children receiving therapeutic food in Borno before the program was abruptly ended earlier this year, following a US funding cut, according to Mercy Corps, which operated three outpatient nutrition clinics in northeast Nigeria.\n\nMercy Corps said it was forced to close 42 programs earlier this year that could have reached more than 3.6 million people in crisis hotspots, including Nigeria, Sudan, Afghanistan, Somalia, Gaza and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe impact has been devastating for Usman. The loss of her son compounded her grief \u2013 she had already lost her triplets just three days after their birth in 2023.\n\n\u201cI was sick and had no breastmilk,\u201d she recalled of her triplets\u2019 brief lives. \u201cThere was nothing I could afford to give them to survive, so the babies died of hunger.\u201d\n\nNew US intervention \u2018a temporary relief\u2019\n\nUsman began receiving additional food assistance from the WFP last year, but this month she was informed that she would no longer qualify, she said, as the agency reallocates its limited resources.\n\nDavid Stevenson, WFP\u2019s chief in Nigeria, told CNN the agency was forced to make cuts, and would be reducing support in the north of the country from 1.3 million people in July to 850,000 by September.\n\nStevenson thanked the United States, the WFP\u2019s largest donor, for a $32.5 million donation the US Embassy in Nigeria announced on September 3 \u201cfor food and nutrition assistance to help save lives in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHowever, he warned that the US contribution, together with less than $10 million from other donors, would only keep operations running until the end of November.\n\nStevenson said that the available resources would help reopen several nutrition clinics and provide food assistance to some communities and displaced people \u2013 a temporary reprieve following recent closures.\n\nUndernutrition deaths happen \u2018almost every month\u2019\n\nHassan Abubakar Bukar, a nutrition counsellor in Borno, told CNN that malnourished children are a painfully common sight. Deaths from undernutrition, like that of Usman\u2019s baby, are tragically frequent in the region.\n\n\u201cAlmost every month, we encounter stories like these,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause of fewer (nutrition clinic) sites in Dikwa, a lot of malnourished children are left out,\u201d Bukar said. \u201cThe parents cannot afford (nutritious) diets, so most of the children may die at home.\u201d\n\nUsman is anxious about the fate of her surviving twin, who is 18 months old and in need of nutritional treatment.\n\n\u201cI have that fear in my mind. I\u2019m always thinking about how I could get something to feed him,\u201d she said.\n\nMercy Corps told CNN there is a glimmer of hope for vulnerable people. In June, two of the organization\u2019s previously closed health centers reopened after their US-funded project was allowed to continue following the earlier stop-work order.\n\nThe Trump administration had previously canceled more than 80% of programs at USAID, which delivered US humanitarian aid overseas. It later essentially shuttered the agency, claiming it was engaged in waste and abuse, and moved foreign aid administration under the State Department, which critics say has not delivered on much of USAID\u2019s legacy work.\n\nThe nutrition centers now run under an extension of the project, with existing USAID funding rolled over, according to Mercy Corps\u2019 regional director for Africa, Melaku Yirga. But this will only last until October, Yirga added.\n\nUsman\u2019s surviving twin was readmitted to the nutrition program in July and still receives ready-to-use therapeutic food packets and critical care for severe malnutrition, Mercy Corps said, but the threat of further funding cuts puts ongoing treatment for this child and others at risk.\n\nForeign aid less than 1% of US budget\n\nThe US provides the world\u2019s largest portion of humanitarian aid, spending more than $54 billion since 2021, with $3.8 billion allocated to Africa last year, Jeffrey Prescott, who was the US ambassador to the UN Agencies for Food and Agriculture in Rome until January, said in a speech last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really less than 1% of the federal budget,\u201d Margaret Schuler, the chief impact officer at the global Christian humanitarian organization World Vision, said about America\u2019s yearly humanitarian spending.\n\n\u201cWe really believe that foreign aid is a great investment for the US government in terms of the return it brings,\u201d she told CNN, citing global benefits like progress toward eradicating polio and reducing infectious diseases.\n\nWorld Vision had about $100 million worth of US government funding cut, according to Schuler.\n\n\u201cLike many organizations, we had programs cut across all regions in the world, over 20 countries, and what was a little bit surprising was the fact that what would have been considered \u2018lifesaving programs\u2019 were terminated,\u201d including programs in Mali, South Sudan and Kenya, Schuler told CNN in August.\n\n\u201cThose were programs that were serving some of the most vulnerable populations around the world.\u201d\n\nShe warned that filling the funding gaps would be difficult.\n\n\u201cFor some of these large-scale food aid programs or programs that we implement at scale in the hardest places around the world, it\u2019s very hard to fill some of those gaps with private resources.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is trying to freeze another $4.9 billion in foreign aid that was approved by Congress in 2024 but that the White House says no longer aligns with its \u201cAmerica-first\u201d priorities to ensure overseas spending makes the country \u201csafer, stronger, and more prosperous.\u201d Trump is mounting a multifront effort to cancel that foreign aid spending both in the courts and on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn Yirga\u2019s view, an abrupt end to US foreign assistance \u201crisks reversing decades of progress, forcing families into dangerous coping strategies and stripping away their last lifeline.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned, \u201cThe world cannot afford to look away \u2013 not when mothers like Yagana (Usman) face the unbearable risk of losing more children.\u201d"

The film follows Mary, who joins a group of orphans and ends up imprisoned by a woman seeking a replacement for her deceased daughter, leading to a mix of gothic fairytale elements and horror. While Michelle Dockery delivers a strong performance as the captor, the film suffers from uneven character development and clich\u00e9d storytelling, ultimately failing to fully engage its audience.",

                "text": "This low-budget horror thriller comes with an almighty directorial last name, but Steven\u2019s daughter Destry serves up precious little that is classically Spielbergian in her debut feature. Forget Dad\u2019s signature childlike wonder; the youngsters in this post-apocalyptic outing \u2013 ostracised because minors are asymptomatic carriers of a plague that turns adults into cannibals \u2013 are completely feral, opportunistic and worryingly keen to kill. Spielberg\u2019s film is a surprisingly nihilistic, if uneven, splicing of 21st-century young-adult and 1970s exploitation flicks.\n\nAfter making a break for the border, roving juvenile Mary (Zoe Colletti) takes up with a band of orphans squatting a nearby community centre. Leader Ben (Andrew Liner) is wounded during a botched armed robbery on a service station, so they take refuge in an isolated house. The unlikely owner is plummy, sardonic Brit Clara (Downton Abbey\u2019s Michelle Dockery) \u2013 who stitches him up and deems that what these wastrels really need is a big plate of cookies. When the group wake up imprisoned in Clara\u2019s attic, it should only reinforce rule number one: never eat the cookies.\n\nMary is spared the sequestration because Clara views her as a potential replacement for her own daughter, part of the 1% of children who succumbed to the pandemic. So the youngster is installed in a flowery bedroom and forced to placate her captor like in Misery, and so the film enters into interestingly queasy gothic-fairytale terrain. But Spielberg balances it uneasily with the pure horror taking place upstairs, not quite satisfactorily constructing one or the other. As the group is shunted off one-by-one to a cold shower and an unspeakable fate in an adjacent room, the wan characterisation means the tension only intermittently smoulders. Breaking Bad\u2019s Giancarlo Esposito periodically peps it up as a nosy sheriff.\n\nPlease Don\u2019t Feed the Children also has unfortunately frequent recourse to lazy storytelling shortcuts, with characters making ill-advised decisions or conveniently waking early from drug-induced stupors. But Dockery maintains rigour and bite at the centre as the genial jailer, and there\u2019s an edginess to Spielberg\u2019s direction, the camera roving around this posse of junior desperadoes and suggesting she may have inherited a certain cinematic intuition. But, like the abomination upstairs, she takes a ragged first bite here."

The market, primarily centered in London, offers a range of policies that cover various risks associated with conflict, including terrorism and civil war, but determining premium costs remains challenging due to the unpredictable nature of such events.",
                "source": "BBC",
                "text": "2 days ago\n\nPadraig BeltonBusiness reporter\n\nWith conflict continuing in Ukraine and the Middle East, a little-explored global industry has never been more in demand \u2013 the war risk insurance market.\n\nWhen a Russian missile damaged Natalia Grishko's apartment in a tower block on the outskirts of Kyiv last November she thankfully was not injured.\n\nMrs Grishko's daughter, Alina Kalcheva, says the missile fell about 100m (328ft) from the building. \"The blast wave damaged my mother's balcony, windows, doors, and the interior of the apartment.\"\n\nWhile her mum was \"of course very upset and cried\" to begin with, Mrs Kalcheva says she ultimately felt calm because they had insured the flat against such an attack.\n\nFor while general household insurance doesn't cover conflict damage \u2013 whether you live in Ukraine or a country not under attack - Mrs Kalcheva had had the foresight to take out specialist war risk insurance cover for her mother. And the insurer paid out $1,000 (\u00a3740) to help cover the repairs.\n\nThe annual premium or cost was $52, and the 33-year-old says she \"didn't hesitate to buy it. And as it turned out it was obviously the right decision.\"\n\nFellow Ukrainian Ekaterina Vasylieva even took out a war risk policy for her car in April 2024. That was particularly timely, because only a day later her vehicle was damaged by Russian shrapnel when it was parked in a street in the coastal city of Odesa.\n\n\"Only the day before I extended the comprehensive insurance on the car, and the manager offered for me to get insurance against military risks,\" she says. \"The cover saved me a lot because after the Russian attack the car looked like a sieve.\"\n\nWar risk insurance is the general term for a sector that also offers cover against terrorism. Industry experts say it has grown exponentially since the September 11 attacks in the US back in 2001.\n\nAnd while individuals can take out war risk cover, the vast majority of policies are bought by companies who wish to insure their operations, facilities and staff around the world. Especially in high-risk countries and regions.\n\nAlthough data is hard to come by for an industry that doesn't seek the limelight, one trade publication this year estimated that the global amount spent on taking out war risk insurance now totals about $1bn (\u00a3800m) per annum.\n\nAnd \u00a3621m, or nearly 80%, of that figure is said to go to specialist insurers in the City of London, which is the centre of the international war risk insurance market.\n\nJoanna Cousins heads a nine-person political violence and war team at one such London-based insurer \u2013 Westfield Speciality.\n\nShe cites the example of a large energy facility in Iraq, owned by a Western company, which has been attacked multiple times in recent years.\n\nMrs Cousins says that the owner ultimately bought more than \u00a3100m of war risk cover, without which it would have \"ceased or greatly reduced\" the operation of the site.\n\nPeople in the war risk market are not normally very keen to talk about how much a policy costs. But for a British or American company operating in Lebanon or Israel, \"currently, premiums are priced between 0.5% and 2% of the total cover they buy,\" says a senior London war risk insurance underwriter who asked not to be named.\n\nAn underwriter is a finance professional who determines the level of risk of an insurance application, and then calculates what the cost of the cover will be.\n\nThe 0.5% to 2% range means that if a business wants \u00a3100m of annual cover it has to pay between \u00a3500,000 and \u00a32m. However, these rates will \"fluctuate significantly as the situation in different countries in the Middle East is volatile\", adds the unnamed underwriter.\n\nPremiums in stable Gulf states are said to be much lower, from 0.025% to 0.05% of the total amount covered.\n\nWhat is actually covered by a policy can vary. For example, a company can get cover for kidnappings and ransoms, treating serious injuries, or the cost of dealing with an \"active assailant\" situation.\n\n\"The market is growing in capacity and demand, \" says Daniel Hiller, underwriter, and group head of terrorism and political violence at insurer Munich Re Specialty.\n\n\"There are more perils customers can buy coverage for, especially around the active shooter product, but also strikes and riots.\"\n\nWar risk cover is organised in seven \"buckets\" spanning different severities of conflict. Sabotage and terrorism are considered to be the lowest, while civil and interstate war are the highest.\n\n\"Many insurers try to offer all this coverage, since often it's not clear where a situation has moved from risk of terrorism, to civil war, to even interstate war,\" says Raveem Ismail, founder of specialist insurance firm London-based Trigger Parametric.\n\nThe war risk sector is centred on London due to the continuing strength of Lloyds of London, which has been a specialist insurance market since 1689.\n\nLloyds is also home to war risk insurance reinsurers \u2013 firms who buy and sell the cover.\n\nMs Cousins says this spreads out the possible exposure. \"Each [reinsurer] covers a certain percentage of the risk, of anywhere between one and 10%,\" she says.\n\nConstantin Gurdgiev, a finance professor at the University of Northern Colorado, and an expert in the study of risk and conflict finance, says the challenge for the war risk sector is to work out what premium to charge for cover.\n\n\"Wars and conflicts more generally represent black swan [very rare] events,\" he says. Because of this rarity, he adds that \"historical data tends to be a weak basis for establishing any priceable insights\".\n\nYet Mr Ismail points out that war risk insurance can be very profitable, something he contrasts with the car insurance sector.\n\n\"As a car insurer, for every \u00a31 of premiums you take in, you pay back almost \u00a31.05 in claims,\" he says. You might think that the maths doesn't add up there, but Dr Ismail says that the car insurers make the 5p and more from investment income.\n\nBy contrast, war risk insurance funds can pay out as little as 2%. Put simply, car crashes remain far more common than war damage."

The incident has prompted discussions about gun sales practices and mental health, as well as the broader implications of proposed restrictions targeting specific groups, such as transgender individuals.",
                "source": "cnn",
                "text": "Five federal agents entered the gun store on the busy highway in central Minnesota that Chris Mercadante manages and gave him a serial number.\n\nUnfamiliar, he flicked through the book that keeps a record of every gun that passes through Frontiersman Sports gun shop until he spotted it. It belonged to a revolver purchased by a customer just four days prior.\n\nThat customer had opened fire on Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis just hours earlier, authorities say, firing through the windows at the pews, killing two children and wounding 18 other people.\n\nWorry had been stirring within 60-year-old Mercadante even before the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents showed up at the store on August 27 \u2013 ever since he heard about the devastating mass shooting carried out just 10 miles away.\n\n\u201cYou never want to hear this, you never want to see this, you never want to be a part of this,\u201d he said, adding there\u2019s always a concern a gun used to carry out a mass shooting could have come from his store.\n\nAfter confirming to the agents that the customer purchased a .38 special caliber revolver and its ammo from the store, he found surveillance footage of the shooter shopping for guns and browsing ammo on August 23.\n\nThe suspect \u2013 identified by police as Robin Westman \u2013 was inside the store for 40 minutes, talking and laughing with other employees, as well as a customer, and testing out different firearms, the eerie footage shows.\n\nWhile police have not mentioned a revolver being used in the shooting at Annunciation, the sight shook the store workers with years of experience who took pride in going the extra mile to make sure their guns didn\u2019t fall into the wrong hands.\n\nMercadante, who wasn\u2019t working the day the suspect came in, says he prayed with his staff, including the ones who spoke to the suspected shooter.\n\nThey all agreed: The normal red flags they\u2019re trained to catch weren\u2019t there.\n\nThe customer asked the right questions, appeared friendly, acted \u201cnormal\u201d and seemed very knowledgeable about guns, one of the employees who was working when the suspect came in told CNN.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said the employee, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons. \u201cThe person didn\u2019t seem like there was anything abnormal going on with them.\u201d\n\nKory Krause, the owner of Frontiersman Sports, said he felt like he needed to \u201ctake a shower\u201d after watching the footage of the suspect in the store he\u2019s owned for 16 years.\n\nIt\u2019s important for Krause that his employees pick up on even the most subtle warning signs. They refuse to sell firearms to shoppers they suspect may be a danger to themselves or others, seem mentally unstable, are under the influence of drugs or alcohol or appear to be purchasing a gun for someone else, Krause said, adding sometimes they\u2019ll turn away multiple people in one week.\n\n\u201cWe do not discriminate based on race, ethnicity, sex, age, sexual orientation, or appearance. We do discriminate based solely on behavior and actions,\u201d Krause said.\n\nThere is no mention of the revolver purchased at Frontiersman Sports in police search warrant documents related to the shooting investigation, which list a Magpul semi-automatic rifle, a Taurus semi-automatic pistol and a Mossberg pump-action shotgun among the evidence collected. When asked by CNN, police could not comment on whether a revolver was taken into evidence.\n\nStill, Frontiersman Sports\u2019 youngest employee was the person who sold the suspect the gun, and Krause said the incident has affected him.\n\n\u201cYou always sit back and go, \u2018Could I have done more?\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Did something stand out that I didn\u2019t see?\u2019\u201d Mercadante said. \u201cThe (suspect) was smiling and joking and laughing. I mean, if that\u2019s not evil, I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d\n\nSpotting red flags in shoppers\n\nWhile Minnesota state laws already prohibit the sale of guns to those with a criminal record or who have been adjudicated as mentally ill, among other restrictions, Krause says his store goes above and beyond to try to make sure their guns don\u2019t end up with bad actors.\n\nMercadante, who has been a US Concealed Carry Association and NRA instructor for 20 years, said weeding out the bad eggs is not an exact science.\n\nOne big thing they look for is straw purchases, whether a person is trying to buy a gun for someone who can\u2019t legally purchase one.\n\n\u201c(My guys) are watching everything very closely. They\u2019re even watching outside,\u201d said Krause. \u201cThey see it coming. They see it before it even comes in the door a lot of the time.\u201d\n\nHis staff is attuned to when a car full of people pulls up to the store, but only one person comes inside \u2013 especially if that one person is a young girl with a specific gun model in mind.\n\nIn fact, two years ago the store decided to ban phone use. They caught one too many people taking photos of guns to send to someone else to buy for them.\n\nThey\u2019ll also look for other red flags in shoppers that point to mental health issues.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s obvious. One time a person came into the store saying, \u201cI\u2019m so sick of that g**damn neighbor. I\u2019m going to get a gun,\u201d Krause said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Nah, no you\u2019re not,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nBut most of the time it\u2019s more subtle. The staff think about the questions the person is asking about guns. They notice if the person is sweating or stumbling over their words. They also take note of how they\u2019re holding the gun.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what they\u2019re buying, it\u2019s more about how they\u2019re acting when they are buying the gun,\u201d Mercadante said. \u201cSometimes you just get a feeling that they\u2019re not being upfront with you.\u201d\n\nThe process by which the staff learn how to identify potential bad actors is constantly evolving, with some formal training but a lot of discussing issues and red flags as they arise, they said.\n\nKrause recalled a time when an elderly shopper struggling to hold a gun asked to buy a revolver and just one round of ammunition, as opposed to the whole box \u2013 details that led staff to suspect the man may be suicidal and refuse to sell him the gun.\n\nIn situations like this, Mercadante said he tells customers that he\u2019s not comfortable selling them a gun and explains his reasoning. From there, he\u2019ll contact local authorities to speak with the person they suspect to be suicidal.\n\nKrause added that they\u2019ll also notify other gun shops in the area to give them a heads up.\n\nThe store has also taken additional measures after Charlie\u2019s Kirk\u2019s shooting on September 10, like being prepared to deny guns to people wearing the same distinctive American flag and eagle T-shirt that Kirk\u2019s shooting suspect wore. Depending on the customer\u2019s actions, they\u2019ll also call the ATF or local police.\n\nWhen Mercadante has a gut feeling that something isn\u2019t right, sometimes he\u2019ll ask one of his staffers for a second opinion. Mercadante said upset shoppers have accused him of discrimination and threatened to sue him for refusing to sell, but that never changes his mind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to let a gun go out if I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s right,\u201d he said.\n\nSuspect had permit to buy guns\n\nThe interaction with Westman was like any another: The customer spoke about revolvers and seemed knowledgeable, said the employee who was at the store that day.\n\n\u201cI kind of thought that this might be one of our next repeat customers that comes in quite often because they didn\u2019t sound like they lived too far and knew what they were talking about,\u201d the employee said.\n\nBesides the scrutiny from behind the counter, customers also need to pass the FBI\u2019s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to be able to buy a firearm. That means that a customer fills out a form, Mercadante submits it online, and then he gets a response usually within five minutes that says \u201capprove,\u201d \u201cdelay,\u201d or \u201cdeny.\u201d\n\nA shopper can receive a denial for several reasons, including for having a criminal record, an addiction to a controlled substance, previous time in a mental institution, a court order related to certain domestic violence charges \u2013 or because of red flag laws.\n\nMinnesota customers also need permits to purchase or carry handguns and semi-automatic assault weapons, which require background checks.\n\nWestman had recently been issued a permit to purchase, according to Minneapolis police. A search of state court records also showed no criminal history for the suspect, but some traffic citations in 2021.\n\nIn Minnesota, an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) allows family members and law enforcement to request an order from the court to temporarily prohibit someone from buying or possessing a firearm. There is no record of an ERPO being filed for Westman, according to Hennepin County District Court spokesperson Matt Lehman.\n\nDenying guns to trans people isn\u2019t the answer, owner says\n\nIn the wake of the Minneapolis shooting, CNN reported that senior Justice Department officials were weighing proposals to limit transgender people\u2019s right to possess firearms by declaring that transgender people are mentally ill, according to two officials familiar with the internal discussions.\n\nNews of the talks came after federal officials referred to the suspect in the church shooting as transgender, and a name change petition approved in 2020 noted the person identifies as female.\n\nKrause said a ban of this nature wouldn\u2019t solve any issues and would be difficult to enforce. He said the focus needs to be more on mental health issues, and he doesn\u2019t believe being transgender is a mental illness.\n\nBeing transgender is not a psychiatric diagnosis, according to the American Psychiatric Association. Some transgender people do experience gender dysphoria, which is a diagnosable condition that occurs when a person has clinically significant distress over the incongruence between their gender and sex assigned at birth, which can cause impairment in social situations, work or other important areas of life.\n\nThe vast majority of mass attacks in the US have no connection to transgender people.\n\nFrom January 2013 to the present, of the more than 5,700 mass shootings in the United States, five shooters were confirmed to be transgender, according to Mark Bryant, founding executive director of the Gun Violence Archive. CNN and the GVA define a mass shooting as one that injured or killed four or more people, not including the shooter.\n\nFrontiersman Sports, situated on a busy highway, sees a variety of customers, including transgender people who are regulars at the store, the owner said.\n\n\u201cWe have a trans couple, for instance, that they\u2019re prolific shooters. They love to shoot. They\u2019re range shooters. They collect guns. They buy guns \u2026 but they\u2019re not mentally ill or unstable,\u201d Krause said.\n\nKrause wondered how his staff would even be able to identify transgender customers or properly enforce this type of ban.\n\n\u201cThat opens a can of worms that I think is absolutely ridiculous, frankly. I don\u2019t know how you would differentiate,\u201d Krause said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be doing body inspections.\u201d\n\nMercadante emphasized that he and the others wish they could go back in time to stop the shooting.\n\n\u201cYou have to move on from these things, not that you want to move on from what happened, but you always want to remember it,\u201d Mercadante said. \u201cYou always want to make sure that you keep your senses and your awareness up, and it gets up a little bit higher because you want to be the one that stops the next one.\u201d"

                "text": "Modi's tax cuts will give India a festive spending boost\n\n2 days ago\n\nNikhil Inamdar & Archana ShuklaBBC News, Mumbai\n\nStarting Monday, the daily economic burdens of millions of Indians could ease slightly.\n\nStaples like milk and bread, life and medical insurance and life-saving drugs will become tax-free. Consumption tax on small cars, television sets and air conditioners will drop from 28% to 18%. And other common goods like hair oil, toilet soap and shampoo will be taxed at a marginal 5% instead of 12% or 18%.\n\nThe sweeping cuts are part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's major overhaul of India's complex goods and services tax (GST) regime announced earlier this month.\n\nThis is expected to both simplify the tax code and give flagging household consumption - which makes up over half of India's gross domestic product (GDP) - a much-needed fillip.\n\nIndia GST: The \u2018cheesy\u2019 row over pizza toppings tax\n\nThe timing couldn't be more opportune.\n\nLower GST rates coincide with the beginning of a long festive season when Indians typically open their purse strings to buy everything from new cars to clothes.\n\nThis four-month period also brings in a bulk of yearly sales for consumer goods companies such as packaged food makers and apparel manufacturers.\n\nThe hope is, reduced taxes will mitigate some of the impact of the US's bruising 50% tariffs on India, leave people with more money to spend and spruce up the domestic economy.\n\nThe cuts come off the back of a $12bn income tax giveaway announced in February and lower interest rates from India's central bank, all of which bode well for a consumption pick-up.\n\nCompanies, including Reliance, consumer staples giant HUL, and automaker Mahindra & Mahindra will pass on lower taxes to consumers to boost demand.\n\nCarmakers are banking on the cuts, with share prices up 6-17% since Modi's August announcement, while dealerships report rising enquiries amid unsold inventory.\n\nAt a Mumbai showroom of Hero Motocorp, India's largest motorbike manufacturer, a dealer told the BBC that he expected sales to jump 30\u201340% over the next two months compared to last year.\n\n\"Easing the cost burden of first-time owners has increased enquiries and footfall,\" Ashutosh Varma, Hero India's chief business officer, told the BBC. This is especially so for \"cheaper variants\", he said, where price sensitivity is the highest.\n\nVishal Pawar, a software developer who was at the showroom, said he's considering upgrading to a 200cc bike this year.\n\n\"The best time to buy is when festival discounts and tax cuts overlap. I'll make the purchase during the Dussehra festival,\" Mr Pawar said.\n\nCompanies that make consumer goods are also upbeat about a pick-up in demand.\n\nSabyasachi Gupta of Godrej Enterprises Group said the tax cuts coupled with a good harvest could go some way in expanding the market for discretionary goods like air-conditioners beyond the metro cities.\n\nBut the changes have led to a last-minute scramble among companies like his - right from reprinting labels to reflect new prices and balancing production with uncertain demand.\n\n\"We're keeping old and new labels side by side so consumers can see their savings,\" Mr Gupta told the BBC.\n\nAmong smaller brands and shopkeepers, news of the tax changes is slow to reach, and many say they lack the capacity to adjust pricing and packaging on short notice.\n\nIn Mumbai's iconic Crawford Market, the city's biggest wholesale and retail hub where everything from spices to sequins are sold, few shopkeepers were aware of changes to GST slabs.\n\nThose who knew about it were confused.\n\nSheikh Rehman, who owns a crockery store, said he was still negotiating with his suppliers on how to manage taxes on the inventory he had already purchased.\n\nNext door, at a bridal showroom there was disappointment. The government has cut GST on garments costing less than $29 (\u00a321.2) to 5%, but items priced above that figure now face a higher levy of 18%.\n\nWedding outfits rarely cost less than $29, meaning nearly every ensemble in Naresh G's store will attract a higher tax. This could have a cascading impact across the supply chain from craftsmen to designers and retailers.\n\n\"Indians spend a lot on wedding clothes and the season is just about to start, the tax hikes may take away some of the shine,\" Mr Naresh said.\n\nAt a net level though, the impact of the GST cuts is expected to be largely positive.\n\nAccording to ratings agency Crisil, lower taxes will benefit a third of an average consumer's monthly expenditure basket and improve the middle class's purchasing power.\n\nThe extent of the impact will depend on \"the degree to which producers pass the rate cuts to consumers\", Crisil said in a report, adding that the impact will play out over this and the next financial year.\n\nThe cuts, of course, come at a cost.\n\nThe government predicts they could lead to a revenue loss of around $5.4bn this year. But independent experts and rating agencies like Moody's expect the figure to be higher, with the strain on the exchequer \"even more pronounced\" in the coming years.\n\nThese losses add to a bleak macro picture: federal tax revenues have barely grown in the first four months, compared with a 20% jump last year, while spending is already up more than 20%.\n\nWith Delhi intent on keeping its fiscal deficit - the gap between revenue and expenditure - in check, the Modi government may have to hit the brakes on the big-ticket road and port spending that has driven India's growth over the past five years.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube,X and Facebook."

                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "One hundred days after Elon Musk entered the White House as Donald Trump\u2019s senior adviser and the de facto leader of the so-called \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d (Doge), the Tesla CEO has left little of the federal government unscathed. Over the course of just a few months, he has gutted agencies and public services that took decades to build while accumulating immense political power.\n\nMusk\u2019s role in the Trump administration is without modern precedent. Never before has the world\u2019s richest person been deputized by the US president to cull the very agencies that oversee his businesses. Musk\u2019s attempts to radically dismantle government bureaus have won him sprawling influence. His team has embedded its members in key roles across federal agencies, gained access to personal data on millions of Americans and fired tens of thousands of workers. SpaceX, where he is CEO, is now poised to take over potential government contracts worth billions. He has left a trail of chaos while seeding the government with his allies, who will probably help him profit and preserve his newfound power.\n\nThe billionaire\u2019s newfound sway has not come without pushback and a cost. Doge\u2019s blitz through the government has sparked furious nationwide backlash, as well as dozens of lawsuits challenging Musk\u2019s mass firings and accusing his taskforce of violating numerous laws. Musk\u2019s personal popularity has sunk to record lows, and Tesla\u2019s profits have tanked.\n\nA look back at the first 100 days of the Trump administration shows the extent to which Musk\u2019s efforts have changed the US government. It also shows that what Musk framed as a cost-cutting task initiative is failing to meet its ostensible goal of finding $1tn in fraud or waste, but it is succeeding in reshaping federal agencies along ideological grounds, paving the way for private companies to fill the resulting vacuum of public services.\n\nMusk has recently stopped physically working from the White House and stated he plans to pivot away from his government position soon, but has entrenched himself as one of the world\u2019s most divisive political figures and shows no sign he is willing to fully give up his influence. Instead, the first 100 days of Doge shows that the scope of Musk\u2019s ambition extends to remaking how the government deals with everything from humanitarian aid to the rule of law.\n\nDoge sweeps through agencies\n\nOn the same day Trump was sworn into office, the president issued an executive order that created Musk\u2019s \u201cdepartment of government efficiency\u201d by renaming the US Digital Service agency, which previously handled governmental tech issues. Trump\u2019s order included only a vague mandate to modernize government technology and increase efficiency, but within days it would become clear that Musk and his team had far more expansive aims.\n\nIn the months leading up to the executive order, Musk had been hiring a team of staffers that included a mix of young engineers, tech world executives and longtime lieutenants from his private companies. Running the day-to-day operations was Steve Davis, who had worked with Musk at various companies, including SpaceX and the Boring Company, for more than 20 years. Davis was known as an exacting boss \u2013 Musk once compared him to chemotherapy. Others had far less experience, including 19-year-old Edward Coristine, who had worked for several months at Musk\u2019s Neuralink company. The teenager had been fired from a previous internship for leaking information and went by the username \u201cbig balls\u201d in online profiles.\n\nDoge\u2019s early days made headlines for targeting masses of government workers with layoffs and pushing others to resign, with more than 2 million employees receiving an email on 28 January titled \u201cFork in the road\u201d that encouraged staffers to take a buyout. The emails, which asked: \u201cWhat did you accomplish this week?\u201d would become a signature of Musk and his new bureau, sent again and again whenever staff began to prey on a new herd of government employees.\n\nShortly after Trump\u2019s executive order created Doge, Musk\u2019s team quickly began popping up in the offices of numerous agencies. One of the first was the General Services Administration, which oversees digital technology and government buildings. Doge staffers appeared on Zoom calls with no introduction and hidden last names, questioning federal employees about what they did for work and refusing to answer questions. They also began to show up in person, taking over conference rooms and moving Ikea beds on to the sixth floor of the GSA to sleep overnight. Perplexed government workers at numerous agencies described Doge\u2019s actions as a hostile takeover, where a goon squad would appear and demand rapid changes to systems they knew little about.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve only fired people and turned things off,\u201d said a current federal employee, who agreed to speak anonymously for fear of retribution.\n\nSimultaneously, Doge staffers were aggressively gaining access to key data systems that controlled the flow of payments to federal workers and funding for government contracts. In one striking incident, Doge team members clashed with the highest-ranking career official at the treasury department over access to a payment system that controls $6tn in annual funds. The fight ended with the official, David Lebryk, being put on administrative leave before he ultimately resigned. Doge staff obtained the access they wanted.\n\nPushback against Doge from other officials resulted in similar punishments. As Doge staffers stormed into the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in early February, they found themselves in a heated standoff with security officials who tried to bar them from accessing a secure room which held sensitive and confidential data. The confrontation ended with USAID\u2019s top security official being put on administrative leave, while Doge gained access to its systems. With no one to stop them, Doge staffers then began the process of hollowing out the agency that had once been the world\u2019s largest single supplier of humanitarian aid. More than 5,600 USAID workers around the world would be fired in the ensuing weeks.\n\n\u201cWe spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,\u201d Musk boasted days later on X, his social media platform.\n\nMusk moves to gut the government\n\nDoge\u2019s targeting of USAID turned out to be a blueprint for how Musk and company would go after other parts of the government. In early February, Musk\u2019s team had established a presence across federal agencies and placed itself at the fulcrum of government employment systems. The next step was mass layoffs.\n\n\u201cWe do need to delete entire agencies,\u201d Musk told attenders at a World Governments Summit in Dubai on 13 February. \u201cIf we don\u2019t remove the roots of the weed, then it\u2019s easy for the weed to grow back.\u201d\n\nThe same day as Musk\u2019s remarks, the Trump administration ordered agencies to fire thousands of probationary workers \u2013 a designation that applies to employees who have been at their jobs for less than a year, including those who may have been recently promoted. Other workers soon received an email from Doge that demanded they list five things that they did last week or face termination, a chaotic request that also turned out to be an empty threat. Cabinet officials privately deemed it nonsensical.\n\nAmid the widespread cuts, Musk began reveling in his new powers both on X and in public appearances. At the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on 23 February he stood on stage in a black Maga hat, sunglasses and gold chain, gleefully wielding a chainsaw that was gifted to him by Javier Milei, the rightwing populist Argentinian president.\n\n\u201cThis chainsaw is for bureaucracy!\u201d he said. \u201cI am become meme.\u201d\n\nWhile Musk celebrated his first cuts, Doge began going after entire offices and agencies it viewed as politically progressive or opposed to its goals. The GSA\u2019s 18F office, which helped build software projects such as the IRS\u2019s free tax filing service, was one of the first targets. On 3 February, Musk told a rightwing influencer on X that the office was \u201cdeleted\u201d in response to an inaccurate post accusing the group of being radical leftists. Employees at the 18F office asked their new Musk-allied leadership what \u201cdeleted\u201d meant, former workers said, but received no further clarification. The employees continued working for weeks under a cloud of confusion and tension with their new leaders, until the middle of the night on Saturday 1 March, when they received an email saying they were going to be laid off en masse.\n\n\u201cWe were living proof that the talking points of this administration were false. Government services can be efficient,\u201d Lindsay Young, the former executive director of 18F, said in a post on LinkedIn. \u201cThis made us a target.\u201d\n\nDoge\u2019s influence soon extended beyond government tech offices into major agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services, which announced in March that it was cutting 10,000 jobs to align with Trump\u2019s executive order on Doge. In a display of the chaos that Doge had inspired, the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, weeks later admitted that around 2,000 of those workers were fired in error and would need to be reinstated.\n\nMusk fights the judicial system\n\nAs soon as Trump issued the executive order to create Doge, watchdog and labor groups filed lawsuits challenging its legality. More lawsuits piled on as Doge accessed sensitive data systems, fired workers and refused to respond to public records requests. Altogether, there have now been more than two dozen cases targeting the agency.\n\nAt first, Doge and Musk seemed to move faster than the judicial system could respond as they slashed and burned government agencies. Around the start of March, however, many of the court cases began to produce rulings that curtailed Doge\u2019s layoffs and temporarily blocked its staff\u2019s access to data. Judges ruled that the Trump administration needed to reinstate probationary workers that they fired, limited some Doge access to databases at agencies such as the Social Security Administration and ordered Musk\u2019s team to turn over internal records it had been seeking to keep private.\n\nMusk\u2019s reaction was a constant stream of attacks against the judicial system on X, which included demands that lawmakers \u201cimpeach the judges\u201d and claims that there was a \u201cjudicial coup\u201d under way against Trump. Musk repeatedly amplified far-right influencers saying that the US should emulate El Salvador\u2019s strongman president, Nayib Bukele, whose party ousted supreme court judges in 2021 in a slide toward authoritarianism.\n\nWhile Musk campaigned against federal judges who were increasing oversight and forcing more transparency on Doge, he also began plowing money into a Wisconsin supreme court race that would have tipped the state\u2019s judicial body conservative. The billionaire and the groups he funded put more than $20m toward electing a conservative judge, which he claimed was crucial to \u201cthe future of civilization\u201d.\n\nThe attempt to influence the Wisconsin vote followed his blueprint from the presidential race. His Super Pac offered $100 to voters willing to sign a petition stating their opposition to \u201cactivist judges\u201d, and he held a campaign rally where he gave out $1m checks on stage. Musk\u2019s effort failed to convince voters, with his preferred candidate losing by 10 percentage points.\n\nThe outcome of the Wisconsin supreme court race proved to be the first in a series of setbacks that tested the limits of Musk\u2019s political influence and the toxicity of his personal brand. As the billionaire embraced his new role as a Republican mega-donor and placed himself often literally at center stage, it became clear that his routine did not always play well outside of the insulated bubbles of Maga rallies and Tesla product launches. While people saw more and more of Musk, polls showed that the public liked him less and less.\n\nProtests boom against Musk and Tesla\n\nAs Musk\u2019s association with Trump and the international far right became too prominent to ignore over the past year, there has been a rising social stigma against associating with his products. The most tangible symbol of Musk\u2019s empire, Tesla, has become the focus of an international protest movement since the creation of Doge. SpaceX, the second-largest source of Musk\u2019s wealth, has seemed insulated from the vicissitudes of consumer sentiment and increased its role in US space operations.\n\nProtests at Tesla dealerships, as well as vandalism against individual cars, started small in the weeks after inauguration, with gatherings of a few dozen people in cities including New York City and San Francisco. Some Tesla owners sold their cars due to the association with Musk or placed \u201cI bought this before we knew Elon was crazy\u201d bumper stickers on their vehicles. The demonstrations quickly escalated to more cities, though, organizing under the banner of \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d protests that targeted showrooms around the country.\n\nBy mid-March, a fully fledged international protest movement against Tesla and Musk had formed and brought about mass protests. Thousands of people gathered at showrooms from Sydney to San Francisco on 30 March in a day of action, with organizers stating that \u201churting Tesla is stopping Musk\u201d. Vandalism against Tesla dealerships, charging stations and cars also intensified around the world, including multiple molotov cocktail attacks and incidents of arson. Trump and Musk called the attacks domestic terrorism, while Pam Bondi, the attorney general, vowed to crack down on anyone targeting Tesla.\n\nThe pressure on Tesla represented a real threat to the company, which was already dealing with an overall sluggish market for electric vehicles and increased competition from Chinese automakers. As protests spread, Musk leaned on his status in Maga world to attempt to revitalize the brand. Trump appeared on the White House driveway in front of several parked Teslas, telling reporters that he was going to buy one of them and praising Musk as a \u201cpatriot\u201d. Others in Trump\u2019s orbit, including the Fox News host Sean Hannity, also posted sales pitches for the automaker.\n\nDespite praise from Trump and Musk\u2019s assurances to workers and investors that they should not sell Tesla stock, analysts reported that the protests along with other economic issues were nevertheless taking a toll. A stock selloff has resulted in Tesla\u2019s share price falling around 25% since the start of the year, wiping billions of dollars from Musk\u2019s net worth. A first-quarter earnings call on 22 April revealed Tesla\u2019s performance was even worse than expectations, with a 71% drop in profits and 9% drop in revenue year over year.\n\nMusk announced on the call that he would spend significantly less time working on Doge starting sometime in May.\n\nMusk eyes an exit, but Doge remains\n\nMusk\u2019s declaration that he would pare back his time with Doge to one or two days a week gave a more definitive sense of his exit after weeks of speculation about when and how he would leave the White House. Although Trump has remained adamant that Musk is doing a good job and remains welcome in the administration, a growing chorus of top officials have either openly feuded with him or privately griped about his presence throughout his first 100 days.\n\nMusk has had intense clashes with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, transportation secretary Sean Duffy and several other top Trump staffers. He reportedly got into a near-physical shouting match with the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in recent weeks, and has publicly called the chief trade adviser, Peter Navarro, the architect of Trump\u2019s tariff policies, \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks\u201d.\n\nThe power struggles between Musk and administration officials leave it unclear how much say Doge will have without Musk constantly placed at the right hand of the president, but his allies are still spread throughout the government and actively working on carrying out his mission. Doge has continued to target agencies throughout April, gutting smaller groups such as an agency that coordinates government policy on homelessness, and eyeing others including the Peace Corps for mass layoffs.\n\nSome of Doge\u2019s cuts have directly targeted agencies that oversee Musk\u2019s companies, including at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that regulates and investigates the risks of self-driving cars. Shifts in priorities and leadership at agencies such as Nasa and the Pentagon also put SpaceX in a position to potentially make billions off of new contracts, while former government employees say it is likely Doge already has access to confidential business data on SpaceX\u2019s competitors.\n\nWhile part of the Doge team is still finding workers to fire, other members have begun accessing even more data systems and are starting to put them to work. One target has been immigration, where Doge staff have accessed personal information that includes therapy records for unaccompanied migrant children, housing information and biometric data. The goal, multiple outlets have reported, is to create a master database that could be used to enforce the Trump administration\u2019s deportations and other anti-immigration maneuvers.\n\nMission accomplished?\n\nAs Doge\u2019s purpose has become more amorphous over its first three months, its initially advertised goal of cutting $1-2tn from the budget has moved further from view. Musk has instead shifted the goal posts, saying that he expects to find $150bn in savings this year \u2013 a fraction of his original goal and a small dent in the overall federal budget. That number may also be an illusion, as Doge\u2019s tally of its savings has been filled with constant errors and miscalculations. Much of Doge\u2019s savings could also be erased by the costs of defending itself in court and losses associated with its mass layoffs.\n\nThe real effects of Doge\u2019s first 100 days are still playing out. Dismantling USAID is projected to cause around 176,000 excess deaths, more than half of them children, according to a Boston University tracking project. Cuts to agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and Federal Emergency Management Agency could imperil natural disaster forecasting and relief. Agencies such as Veterans Affairs that provide public services may deteriorate, while cuts to research and education programs may be felt for decades to come.\n\n\u201cThe amazing thing is that they haven\u2019t actually done anything constructive whatsoever. Literally all they\u2019ve done is destroy things,\u201d a current federal employee said of Doge. \u201cPeople are going to miss the federal government that they had.\u201d"

                "text": "The Atlantic is suddenly buzzing with tropical activity. Hurricane Gabrielle is a strong Category 3 storm east of Bermuda, and two more potential tropical systems \u2014 one nearing the Caribbean and another farther east \u2014 could follow this week.\n\nNeither new disturbance is an immediate threat to land, but the area of storminess near the Leeward Islands and Bahamas is the wild card, with a future US impact possible if atmospheric conditions line up. The eastern system looks more likely to curve out to sea, though it\u2019s too early to say that for certain.\n\nGabrielle, the second major hurricane in the Atlantic basin this year, was packing 125 mph winds Tuesday evening nearly 600 miles east of Bermuda. The violent storm never made landfall on the island and impacts have been minimal, but it will continue to send large swells and rough surf to Bermuda this week even as it tracks east.\n\nThe hurricane will also generate rough seas and dangerous rip currents along much of the US East Coast, from North Carolina to New England, through midweek.\n\nTwo possible storms on deck\n\nTwo areas of stormy weather in the central Atlantic are being tracked by the National Hurricane Center with the potential of becoming the next named storms.\n\nThe stormy area farthest east is steadily organizing and has a high chance of strengthening into a tropical depression or tropical storm Thursday or Friday.\n\nConditions in the atmosphere and ocean around it are becoming more favorable for development, making it likely to become the next named system of the season.\n\nThe next names on the Atlantic season\u2019s 2025 list are Humberto and Imelda.\n\nThe other, slightly weaker and less organized, area of showers and thunderstorms was starting to move over the Lesser Antilles Tuesday. It also has a high chance to develop into a tropical depression late this week near the Bahamas. Before that, it could deliver bursts of rain and wind as it sweeps across the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico and Hispaniola Tuesday through Thursday.\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s heaviest rain will fall from Tuesday night into Thursday with widespread totals of 2 to 4 inches expected, according to the National Weather Service. Some areas could get up to 6 inches of rain. Parts of Puerto Rico have already been soaked in recent days, so any additional rainfall could more quickly trigger flash flooding, rises on area waterways and potentially landslides in steep terrain.\n\nBecause they aren\u2019t organized yet, the potential systems\u2019 paths are very difficult to predict. But weather models are hinting at some options.\n\nThe area farther east could ultimately take a curved path similar to Gabrielle that brings it near Bermuda next week. More options are on the table for the Leeward Islands disturbance, which could become a short-lived system near the Bahamas, or it could survive longer and adopt a Hurricane Erin-like track hugging the US East Coast.\n\nSeptember is the traditional peak of Atlantic hurricane season and activity often ramps up quickly this time of year. While the 2025 season has had a much slower start than anticipated, both hurricanes that did develop \u2013 Erin and Gabrielle \u2013 underwent explosive rapid intensification over warm ocean water. Rapid intensification has become far more common in recent years as the planet warms due to fossil fuel pollution.\n\nErin and Gabrielle both hit major-hurricane status (Category 3 or above). The last time a season\u2019s first two hurricanes were major hurricanes was 2011, with Irene and Katia, according to Dr. Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University.\n\nSo don\u2019t mistake a late start for a quiet finish. With two more potential storms brewing and plenty of warm ocean ahead, the tropical Atlantic season may have just found the gas pedal."

You can sign up for the quiz here on the researchers\u2019 website and get started right away.\n\n\u201cThis is actually an opportunity for folks to contribute to research by joining our website,\u201d said lead researcher Dr. Katie Mehr, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Alberta. \u201cAfter the study concludes and we\u2019re able to analyze all the data, we will share what we found with the readership.\u201d\n\nThe quiz is just two questions, every day for 30 days, that are designed to help participants learn more about their well-being in a quick, easy and fun way. The research requires those who participate to be over 18 years old, be a US resident and have a US phone number that can receive texts.\n\nResearchers can\u2019t share exactly what questions they are investigating because that could risk skewing the results. But the study team hopes the experience will be a way for people to engage with science and pull back the curtain on how the questions about human behavior are answered, Mehr said.\n\n\u201cSometimes there\u2019s these questions where, if we could get a large sample of people who were dealing with this in their life to engage science, we could learn a lot,\u201d said behavioral researcher Dr. Katy Milkman, James G. Dinan Professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard to figure out where do you meet those people.\u201d\n\nThis study is \u201ca fun opportunity for people to be part of what they\u2019re constantly reading and \u2026 get to be part of the news,\u201d Milkman said. \u201cThey will change the news like citizen scientists.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for me?\n\nFocusing on what behaviors can actually help is an important first step toward a healthier life, Milkman said. That is especially true in a time when science isn\u2019t at its most popular and influencers often share information not backed by research.\n\nYou might not know that the research suggests that the Mediterranean diet is one of the healthiest ways of eating, but you heard from an influencer that cutting out carbs and only eating red meat is key to longevity.\n\nIf you set a goal of bettering your nutrition but don\u2019t have the information to guide you toward the best path to accomplish it, you might be working against yourself, Milkman said.\n\nYou may think you know what you need to do to achieve your health goals and are just struggling with implementing the change, Milkman said. But these upcoming results may help you do an even better job working toward increasing your health and longevity.\n\nGet specific about your goals\n\nOnce you have the information about where you can make improvements to your health, the next step is to define your goal, Milkman said.\n\nMost people would say they would like to be healthier, but an effective goal \u2014 say one more hour of sleep each night or two sessions of strength training per week \u2014 is more specific than that, she added.\n\nIf you know you want more balanced nutrition, set a goal with the kinds of food you want to incorporate, and then make a realistic plan that covers how many meals or how many days a week you will build them into your routine, Milkman said.\n\n\u201cIdeally, those goals even include when you will do it, where you will do it, and how you will get there,\u201d she said.\n\nFollowing through on your plans\n\nA lot of people get tripped up in the follow-through, so using strategies to keep you on track is critical, Milkman said.\n\nIn her research, Milkman has found that figuring out a way to make the behavior you\u2019re incorporating instantly gratifying, rewarding and fun helps you look forward to it instead of harboring a sense of dread.\n\n\u201cWe often focus too much on those long-term results,\u201d she said.\n\nOne method is temptation bundling, in which you pair your goal behavior with an activity you enjoy \u2013\u2013 like watching your favorite TV show while you are on the elliptical, Milkman said.\n\n\u201cNow, instead of dreading my workout, there\u2019s a reason to look forward to it,\u201d she said.\n\nMaking your goal behavior more social can also help you stick to it, Milkman added. People are more likely to get to the gym at 3 p.m. if they are meeting a friend there and know they will have someone to talk with to stay motivated.\n\nTiming your goal setting with a moment that feels like a \u201cchange of chapter\u201d can also be helpful, and those times can include the new year, a birthday or the start of the school year \u2013\u2013 whether or not you have kids going to school, Mehr said.\n\n\u201cThose new beginnings tend to be moments when we\u2019re more willing to sort of step back and think big picture,\u201d Milkman said. \u201cIt is a fresh-start moment in the fall.\u201d"

But according to Decotiis, good intentions don\u2019t always mean good results.\n\n\u201cShort term tricks like fasting or skipping meals can scare the metabolism into lowering its metabolic rate,\u201d she explained.\n\nYour metabolism is like an engine that turns food into energy, powering everything from breathing and blood flow to cell growth and repair.\n\nIf you have a fast metabolism, you burn calories quickly \u2014 which is why some people can eat a lot without gaining weight. But a slow metabolism burns fewer calories, meaning more fat gets stored in the body.\n\nWhen the body goes without food for too long, it slows the metabolism to conserve energy and maintain basic functions.\n\n\u201cDiets that eliminate certain foods may keep your weight stable for a while, often by eliminating a calorie source,\u201d Decotiis said.\n\n\u201cHowever, if you are not optimizing your metabolism by burning fat, you will eventually gain more weight,\u201d she continued.\n\nBefore diving into any diet, Decotiis said it\u2019s crucial to know your body composition \u2014 not just your weight.\n\nOne way to get this breakdown is by using a body composition scale, which measures fat, water, muscle and bone mass, as well as resting metabolic rate.\n\n\u201cIf you have more body fat relative to your BMI, the calculation needs to be followed carefully while dieting,\u201d Decotiis said.\n\n\u201cThis is because a patient could be insulin-resistant and need the care of a board-certified weight loss physician,\u201d she explained.\n\nInsulin resistance is when your muscles, fat and liver don\u2019t respond properly to insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar.\n\nLeft untreated, it can lead to a wide range of chronic health conditions, including Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease and heart problems.\n\n\u201cIf your diet isn\u2019t working, take that seriously,\u201d Decotiis urged.\n\nBut not all diet tricks backfire\n\n\u201cSkipping breakfast may actually be a good idea for many people,\u201d Decotiis said.\n\n\u201cHaving a fast from dinner to the following lunchtime can aid insulin function and usually reduces total caloric daily intake,\u201d she continued.\n\nIn fact, a 2019 study found that skipping breakfast doesn\u2019t usually make people hungrier later, it often just leads to fewer calories consumed overall during the day.\n\nBut if you skip your morning meal, be sure to refuel properly later \u2014 otherwise, you risk slowing your metabolism and gaining more weight than you were trying to lose."

Those studies, however, focused on older people and didn\u2019t differentiate between former drinkers and lifelong nondrinkers, thus potentially skewing the results, study authors said.\n\nIn the new study, published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine, researchers analyzed how certain genes linked to alcohol might impact how liquor consumption affects the brain.\n\n\u201cThe genetic analyses results (showed) that even small amounts of alcohol could increase dementia risk,\u201d said lead study author Anya Topiwala, a senior clinical researcher in the department of psychiatry at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest study on the topic, and the combination of observational and genetic analyses was key,\u201d Topiwala said via email.\n\nThe genetic analysis, called Mendelian randomization, has less risk of introducing a confounding or \u201cspurious\u201d variable to explain the alcohol-dementia relationship, Topiwala said.\n\nMendelian randomization also reduces the chance of reverse causation, such as dementia processes influencing drinking rather than the reverse, and it can also estimate the cumulative impact of alcohol consumption over a person\u2019s entire life, Topiwala said. Observational studies, however, tend to capture a snapshot of mid- to late-life drinking habits, and depend on subject recall, which may not be accurate.\n\n\u201cThis is a fairly complicated study that provides some, but not definitive evidence, that alcohol can harm the brain regardless of how much is consumed,\u201d said neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. Isaacson, who conducts studies on cognitive improvement in people who are genetically at risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, was not involved in the new study.\n\n\u201cIn my clinic, we tell people with the APOE4 genetic variant, which is the most common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s, that drinking zero alcohol is best based on the available evidence,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nHowever, for people with less genetic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s it often depends on \u201cwhen\u201d and \u201chow\u201d people drink, Isaacson added. For example, he said, two drinks before bed on an empty stomach several nights will have a more harmful effect on brain health compared with one drink a few times a week with an early dinner.\n\nAn emerging link between alcohol and dementia\n\nThe new study looked at data from nearly 560,000 people who participated in the UK Biobank, a longitudinal study that included participants from England, Scotland and Wales, and the US Million Veteran Program, or MVP, which includes people of European, African and Latin American ancestry.\n\nIn that observational part of the study, people provided self-reports of how much they drank, and researchers compared alcohol consumption with their risk of developing dementia over time.\n\n\u201cIn the self-reporting study, people who reported consuming small amounts of alcohol (less than 7 drinks per week) had lower risk than heavy drinkers (more than 40 drinks per week),\u201d said Tara Spires-Jones, professor of neurodegeneration and director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, in a statement.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, in this part of the study, non-drinkers and people who reported never drinking actually had similar risk of dementia to people who drank heavily,\u201d said Spires-Jones, who is also a group leader in the UK Dementia Research Institute in London. She was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study then examined genetics from 45 studies of dementia in 2.4 million people and compared genetic markers associated with alcohol use over a lifetime.\n\nHigher genetic risk was associated with an increased risk of dementia, with a linear increase in dementia risk the higher the alcohol consumption, according to the study.\n\n\u201cThere is a 15% higher dementia risk for 3 drinks per week compared to 1 drink per week across life,\u201d Topiwala said.\n\nIn addition, a doubling in the genetic risk of alcohol dependency was associated with a 16% increase in dementia risk, according to the study.\n\n\u201cNeither part of the study can conclusively prove that alcohol use directly causes dementia,\u201d Spires-Jones said. \u201cBut this adds to a large amount of similar data showing associations between alcohol intake and increased dementia risk, and fundamental neuroscience work has shown that alcohol is directly toxic to neurons in the brain.\u201d"

Each video follows similar themes: showing people failing to initiate tasks, growing overwhelmed by household chores or theorizing why they\u2019re never on time.\n\nBut what is executive dysfunction? Why do people experience it, and what can be done to mitigate it? Additionally, what is executive function? We asked experts to explain.\n\nWhat is executive function?\n\nExecutive function is the ability to manage and organize tasks on a daily basis, says Mai Uchida, a pediatric psychiatrist at Massachusetts general hospital and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. This includes planning, prioritizing and thinking about how long a task will take you before you need to move on to the next thing. But it also includes the ability to break down larger tasks into smaller ones, being able to shift attention from one task to another, and maintaining working memory.\n\nWhat is executive dysfunction?\n\n\u201cExecutive dysfunction\u201d, on the other hand, is not really a term used by mental health professionals. You\u2019re much more likely to hear a professional say that a person \u201chas difficulties with executive functioning\u201d or \u201chas poor executive function\u201d, says Kristin Carothers, a clinical psychologist based in Atlanta and New York. These professionals don\u2019t want to label anyone as \u201cdysfunctional\u201d, she says.\n\nBut the idea of executive dysfunction does get at a real experience that some people live with.\n\nThe obvious hallmarks of poor executive function include difficulty initiating tasks, missing or running up against deadlines, being late, and losing things. But it can also include patterns such as poor impulse control and overspending, difficulties in following through on promises, and overestimating your ability to follow through on commitments, says Carothers.\n\nCritically, \u201cpoor executive function\u201d and \u201cexecutive dysfunction\u201d are not diagnoses, says Uchida. You cannot be diagnosed with either of these terms, but poor executive function could be a symptom that accompanies a genuine psychiatric condition. Most often, poor executive function is associated with ADHD, she says, though \u201cthere are plenty of people with ADHD who don\u2019t have executive functioning difficulties\u201d. It has no relationship to intelligence. Executive functioning difficulties can also accompany anxiety and depression.\n\nWhat has a negative effect on executive function?\n\nLike most other human traits, executive function exists on a spectrum. \u201cIt\u2019s on a bell curve, where most people are somewhere in the middle,\u201d says Ari Tuckman, a clinical psychologist in Westchester, Pennsylvania. Executive function can also change over your lifetime. For example, \u201cadults have better executive function than kids\u201d, he says. It can decline a bit as a consequence of normal ageing, and those going through menopause will also likely see a greater degree of change as a side-effect of hormonal changes.\n\nLife circumstances can also affect executive function. \u201cIf you have a bad night\u2019s sleep or if you have the flu\u201d, your executive function will take a hit, Tuckman says. Bouts of depression or anxiety, stress, intoxication, head injuries and being busier than usual are also influential factors.\n\nIf you normally don\u2019t struggle with executive function but are having trouble because of temporary life circumstances \u2013 such as getting poor sleep, or being busier than usual \u2013 things should return to normal afterward. But if you have chronic, persistent trouble with managing daily tasks, to the point that it\u2019s affecting your personal and professional life, that might be a sign that there\u2019s an underlying issue, and you might want to see a professional, says Carothers.\n\nAre there ways to improve executive function?\n\nIf your ability to manage and organize tasks is made worse because of existing anxiety or depression, treatments such as therapy or medication to alleviate those psychiatric conditions will also lead to improved executive function, says Tuckman.\n\nFor ADHD, however, while taking medications for the condition can help people avoid distraction and improve concentration, executive functioning skills like \u201corganization, prioritization, and time management are not really treated by the medication\u201d, says Uchida.\n\nWhile there are no real treatments explicitly for poor executive function, there are strategies and workarounds that professionals recommend to help make time management easier. Many are tried and true organizational strategies, says Tuckman: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel.\u201d For example, set up multiple reminders and alarms for yourself, and write out on paper checklists of things to do, even for tasks that are extremely small and easy.\n\nReflect on and try to recognize the patterns that get you into trouble. If you have a work deadline approaching, and you know you tend to lose track of time when you open up and scroll through Instagram, try temporarily removing the app from your phone. Essentially, avoid putting yourself into situations that require more impulse control than you are able to muster, says Tuckman.\n\nIf you get overwhelmed by the size of a task and have trouble getting started, Uchida recommends finding a small amount of time you can commit to. Maybe that\u2019s 15 minutes; maybe it\u2019s just five. Then dedicate just that small amount of time to the task. \u201cWhen the bar is low, it\u2019s a lot easier to get started,\u201d says Uchida, \u201cand sometimes it\u2019s just getting started that\u2019s difficult.\u201d You might find that after that first 15 minutes, you have the ability to keep going. Or you might need a break before you commit to another 15. You have to find and adapt strategies that work for you, she says.\n\nCarothers also recommends turning to community to help you understand where you might need assistance. \u201cSometimes other people have more insight into your behavioral patterns than you do,\u201d she says. \u201cAsk a trusted friend, colleague, romantic partner for areas where they\u2019ve noticed you struggle.\u201d Then ask them to help you brainstorm workarounds for those specific circumstances \u2013 they might have ideas that you never learned or considered. \u201cStrong social connections are important,\u201d Carothers says. \u201cLearn from the people around you.\u201d"

After his diagnosis, he found relief in understanding his condition and now advocates for awareness about younger-onset dementia, emphasizing the need for better support systems for those affected. Dare continues to manage his symptoms and maintains connections with former colleagues, highlighting the importance of community and understanding in coping with dementia.",

                "text": "When Patrick Dare was called into his first-ever HR review at the age of 54, he finally had to be honest with himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d had a high-level career in IT sales for the last 35 years, and I\u2019d never had any issues with my performance until then,\u201d Dare told news.com.au\n\n\u201cFor maybe a year prior, I\u2019d been experiencing some mood changes \u2013 nothing major, just getting a little bit cranky,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was worse in the evenings, I\u2019d be shouting at my partner, Tanya, I\u2019d be shouting at the dogs \u2013 just out-of-character anger. Then, it progressed to paranoia: I became convinced people were talking about me behind my back at work.\u201d\n\nIt culminated with the outburst that landed the usually mild-mannered Dare in performance management, when he swore at a few people in his service team.\n\n\u201cPeople at work knew it wasn\u2019t me and so did I,\u201d he said.\n\nInitially the Queensland resident, who had been through a devastating bout of depression in 2006, worried that his symptoms might be related to another mental health episode.\n\nAfter a suite of tests, however, Dare was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia \u2013 also known as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) \u2013 which is a type more commonly diagnosed in people under the age of 65.\n\nDare said before the diagnosis, his previous understanding of dementia was that it mostly centred on memory loss.\n\nThis is a common misconception, said Associate Professor Rowena Mobbs, one of Australia\u2019s leading concussion and dementia physicians.\n\nMobbs \u2013 who is throwing her support behind news.com.au and The Australian\u2019s Think Again campaign \u2013 said certain conditions can impact the cognitive networks in the brain that influence behaviour, something experts refer to as Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms in Dementia, or BPSD.\n\n\u201cBPSD is a significant cause of complications, including falls, hospitalisations, delirium, and over medication,\u201d Mobbs said.\n\n\u201cIf detected early, many of these issues can be prevented, allowing individuals to live better in the community and providing much relief to their loved ones.\u201d\n\nMore than 433,000 Australians are currently living with dementia with the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) predicting this number to rise to one million by 2065.\n\nAbout 29,000 people aged under 65 are currently living with younger onset dementia, with that number predicted to rise by 41 per cent to 41,000 people by 2054, according to figures from Dementia Australia and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get bogged down in the numbers, but that means that for the next 30 years, there\u2019s going to be a new diagnosis of younger onset dementia every single day in this country,\u201d dementia expert Tim England from YOD Reflections said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to impact not only an individual, but their entire family, every single day for the next 30 years at the current rate.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s why services such as YOD Reflections \u2013 a support service specifically for people living with younger onset dementia \u2013 are so crucial, England said, because the needs of someone living with younger onset dementia can differ greatly than someone diagnosed in their seventies or eighties.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a client who is 32, with a young family,\u201d England said.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of our clients, they\u2019re grappling with a diagnosis while still trying to pay a mortgage, raise kids, make the school bus run. It\u2019s a different set of considerations and it necessitates support for the entire family as well.\u201d\n\nEngland compares the current systemic support for dementia patients with those that exist for breast cancer patients.\n\n\u201cGod forbid you get a diagnosis of breast cancer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat happens after diagnosis? In many cases, you have someone called a breast cancer nurse navigator who is assigned to you straight away to start getting things done, who can put you in touch with various supports and help navigate the services and requirements,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen with dementia. A lot of people are simply handed a diagnosis, then told to get their affairs in order. It can be very isolating.\u201d\n\nFor Dare, who received his diagnosis in 2019, it was both a shock and a bittersweet relief.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, it was a breath of fresh air, because it explained everything,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was as though I\u2019d lost my filter, and once I knew what was going on, I could work harder on correcting things. Before my diagnosis I\u2019d say the wrong thing, or something inappropriate or rude, and I wouldn\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cNow, I realise, and I can catch myself. When I yell at my partner, like I did the other night, I apologise very quickly.\u201d\n\nDare was able to continue working up until 2021, at which point the finer details of his job became too overwhelming and he resigned. He said initially the loss of the career identity that he\u2019d had for more than half his life hit him harder than the initial diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI really withdrew in 2021 and early 2022,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI just did not want to engage, I was worried about saying the wrong thing. Then, I realised I\u2019d done enough wallowing. I decided to get out in front of people and talk to as many people as I can about this disease.\u201d\n\nNow a member of Dementia Australia\u2019s Advisory Committee, Dare is committed to raising awareness of the fact that people with younger-onset dementia can live fulfilling, independent lives with the right support and planning in place.\n\n\u201cI describe my brain as a duck on the surface of the water,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt looks normal enough sailing along, but you can\u2019t see how furiously the legs are paddling underneath.\u201d\n\nDare said he\u2019s now learnt to manage his symptoms by being more realistic about what he can do.\n\n\u201cI now regulate myself,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t drive a car in the afternoons. I don\u2019t put myself in positions of being out late at night or anything like that, because I just can\u2019t handle it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very much aware now of what I do, and while there are times I still can\u2019t stop myself from doing some things, and I get some looks, I\u2019m better at acknowledging and explaining.\u201d\n\nAnd as for his old workmates \u2013 despite the incidents at work, there\u2019s definitely no hard feelings.\n\n\u201cI still catch up for coffee with people I used to work with,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have a chat and a laugh. They jokingly accuse me of playing \u2018the dementia card\u2019 when we\u2019re together.\u201d"

                "text": "Acclaimed Italian actor Claudia Cardinale, who starred in some of the most celebrated European films of the 1960s and 1970s, has died, AFP reported Tuesday. She was 87.\n\nShe starred in more than 100 films and made-for-television productions, but she was best known for embodying youthful purity in Federico Fellini\u2019s \u201c8\u00bd,\u201d in which she co-starred with Marcello Mastroianni in 1963.\n\nCardinale also won praise for her role as Angelica Sedara in Luchino Visconti\u2019s award-winning screen adaption of the historical novel \u201cThe Leopard\u201d that same year and a reformed prostitute in Sergio Leone\u2019s spaghetti western \u201cOnce Upon a Time in the West\u201d in 1968.\n\nShe died in Nemours, France, surrounded by her children, her agent Laurent Savry told AFP. Savry and his agency did not immediately return emailed requests for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nBeginnings\n\nCardinale began her movie-career at the age of 17 after winning a beauty contest in Tunisia, where she was born of Sicilian parents who had emigrated to North Africa. The contest brought her to the Venice Film Festival, where she came to the attention of the Italian movie industry.\n\nBefore entering the beauty contest she had expected to become a school teacher.\n\n\u201cThe fact I\u2019m making movies is just an accident,\u201d Cardinale recalled while accepting a lifetime achievement award at the Berlin Film Festival in 2002. \u201cWhen they asked me, \u2018Do you want to be in the movies?\u2019 I said no and they insisted for six months.\u201d\n\nHer success came in the wake of Sophia Loren\u2019s international stardom and she was touted as Italy\u2019s answer to Brigitte Bardot. While never achieving the level of success of the French actor, Cardinale nonetheless was considered a star and worked with the leading directors in Europe and Hollywood.\n\n\u201cThey gave me everything,\u201d she once said. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous to live so many lives. I\u2019ve been living more than 150 lives, totally different women.\u201d\n\nOne of her earliest roles was as a black-clad Sicilian girl in the 1958 comedy classic \u201cBig Deal on Madonna Street.\u201d It was produced by Franco Cristaldi, who managed her early career and to whom she was married from 1966 to 1975.\n\nA European performer first\n\nThe sensuous brunette with enormous eyes was often cast as a hot-blooded woman. As she had a deep voice and spoke Italian with a heavy French accent, her voice was dubbed in her early movies.\n\nHer career in Hollywood brought only partial success because she was not interested in giving up European film. Nonetheless, she achieved some fame by teaming with Rock Hudson in the 1965 comedy thriller \u201cBlindfold\u201d and another comedy, \u201cDon\u2019t Make Waves\u201d with Tony Curtis, two years later.\n\nCardinale herself considered the 1966 \u201cThe Professionals,\u201d directed by Richard Brooks, as the best of her Hollywood films, where she starred alongside Burt Lancaster, Jack Palance, Robert Ryan and Lee Marvin.\n\nIn a 2002 interview with the Guardian, she explained that the Hollywood studio \u201cwanted me to sign a contract of exclusivity, and I refused. Because I\u2019m a European actress and I was going there for movies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I had a big opportunity with Richard Brooks, \u2018The Professionals,\u2019 which is really a magnificent movie,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me \u2018The Professionals\u2019 is the best I did in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nAmong her industry prizes was a Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement that she received at the Venice Film Festival nearly 40 years after her initial appearance on screen.\n\nIn 2000, Cardinale was named a goodwill ambassador for the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization for the defense of women\u2019s rights.\n\nShe had two children. One with Cristaldi and a second with her later companion, Italian director Pasquale Squitieri."

She gave birth to a son, Patrick, in London in 1958 and passed him off as a younger brother for several years while he was brought up by her parents.\n\nAfter a series of smaller roles, she shot to international fame in 1963 when she featured in Federico Fellini\u2019s 8 1/2 while she also starred alongside Burt Lancaster in The Leopard in the same year.\n\nShooting two films at the same time brought complications, with Cardinale recalling that she had to have different hair colours for the two roles.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian in 2013, Cardinale contrasted the approaches of directors Fellini and Luchino Visconti, who directed The Leopard. \u201cHe [Fellini] couldn\u2019t shoot without noise. With Visconti, the opposite, like doing theatre. We couldn\u2019t say a word. Very serious,\u201d she said.\n\nHer growing profile opened the door to Hollywood productions and she appeared in the comedy caper The Pink Panther, directed by Blake Edwards, and Sergio Leone\u2019s Once Upon A Time In the West in 1968.\n\nCardinale\u2019s career took a hit in the 1970s, after she separated from film producer Franco Cristaldi to start a lifelong relationship with filmmaker Pasquale Squitieri, with whom she had a daughter, also called Claudia. Cristaldi asked friends and associates in the Italian cinema industry to ostracise Cardinale, resulting for example in Visconti turning her down for his last film, The Innocent in 1976.\n\n\u201cIt was a very delicate moment. I discovered I had no money in my bank account,\u201d Cardinale said about the period.\n\nFranco Zeffirelli eventually came to her rescue, casting her in the 1977 television miniseries Jesus of Nazareth. She then continued working with other European directors, including Werner Herzog and Marco Bellocchio.\n\nThe husky-voiced, chain-smoking Cardinale had a reputation as a fiercely independent, free-spirited woman, who once defied Vatican protocol by showing up for a meeting with Pope Paul VI in a miniskirt.\n\nBased for much of the time in France, and friends with the presidents Francois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac, Cardinale turned to the theatre around the turn of this century, winning plaudits for her appearances on the stage.\n\nShe carried on making films in a variety of European languages until late in her life, appearing in the Swiss TV series Bulle in 2020.\n\nAwarded a lifetime achievement award at the Berlin film festival in 2002, she said acting had been a great career. \u201cI\u2019ve lived more than 150 lives \u2013 prostitute, saint, romantic, every kind of woman \u2013 and that is marvellous to have this opportunity to change yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with the most important directors.

The Wall Street Journal was first to report the firing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump earlier this year installed allies at the non-partisan body, also known as America250, including Abergel and his former campaign manager Chris LaCivita as an adviser.\n\nAn America250 spokesperson told CNN in a statement that the commission had issued a written directive weeks ago that, among other things, \u201cremoved its website and social media platforms\u201d from Abergel\u2019s control.\n\nAbergel disputed the commission\u2019s characterization of his firing on Tuesday. In a statement to CNN, he insisted he was fired for posting \u201cGod bless Charlie Kirk\u201d on an account he oversaw and had \u201cfull access\u201d to, referring to a September 11 post to America250\u2019s Instagram account that features a photo of the conservative activist, who was killed at a speaking event at a Utah university the day before.\n\n\u201cNow, Rosie Rios is using ridiculous language like \u2018Security Breach\u2019 to try and justify an unjust firing. The fact is that I was fired for a post that Rosie didn\u2019t like,\u201d he said.\n\nAbergel, a former Melania Trump aide and Fox News producer, arrived at America250 in the spring and helped produce the Army\u2019s military parade in June and the kick-off celebration for the 250th birthday in Iowa in July. Both events received criticism from congressional Democrats on the commission, who argued the events were partisan and did not receive official votes from the commission.\n\nHis firing arrives amid concerns from state and local planners that there is a lack of resources for states to put on their own events. Some have expressed fears that the overall tenor of the celebrations will turn partisan as opposed to unifying and result in a missed opportunity for meaningful reflection on the nation\u2019s past.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has charged ahead with 250th planning of its own, touting plans for a UFC fight in front of the White House.\n\nOther administration plans for the 250th include the Great American State Fair initiative, which asks states to compete to have their fair chosen by Trump as the \u201cmost patriotic\u201d in 2026. The administration has also partnered with conservative media company PragerU on an exhibit about the country\u2019s Founding Fathers, which features AI-created videos of historical figures.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement Tuesday the administration \u201cis incredibly proud of all of Ari Abergel\u2019s work at America250 - most notably during the Army250 parade, which boldly honored the bravery and strength of our military men and women.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough the White House Task Force established by President Trump\u2019s January Executive Order, we will continue to coordinate closely with America250 to ensure that all events heading into our nation\u2019s 250th birthday are given the grand celebration our country deserves,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nThis story was updated with additional information."

Meanwhile, Modelo Especial, while still leading in dollar sales, is facing challenges due to socio-political factors affecting its customer base, prompting Constellation Brands to revise its forecast for declining net beer sales.

                "text": "Perhaps with Leo Messi as the face of Michelob Ultra, it was only a matter of time before the light lager achieved GOAT status.\n\nThe Anheuser-Busch beer has overtaken Bud Light and maintained its lead over rival Modelo Especial in US retail sales by volume for the year-to-date ending on September 14, according to data from Circana seen by CNN.\n\nIn a press release Monday, Anheuser-Busch attributed the momentum partly to the successful launch of Michelob Ultra Zero, a non-alcoholic version of the beer.\n\nIt\u2019s quite the achievement for the brewer, which faced backlash from conservatives and liberals alike over a partnership with a transgender social media influencer that tanked sales of Bud Light and dethroned it as the top-selling beer in the United States, leading Modelo Especial to take its place in 2023.\n\nThe success of Modelo, as well as Corona, seems to have cooled in 2025, partly because of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies. Constellation Brands, the beers\u2019 parent company, warned in April that the president\u2019s deportation push was spooking Latino customers and hurting beer sales.\n\nAbout half of Constellation\u2019s US customers are Hispanic, and some have stopped going out to restaurants and gathering in large groups out of fear of being swept up in deportations, CEO Bill Newlands previously said.\n\nModelo Especial remains number 1 in year-to-date dollar sales, with Michelob Ultra in second place. However, the average retail price per case of Modelo is about $7 more than Michelob Ultra, according to Circana, causing part of the discrepancy.\n\nMichelob Ultra\u2019s success is a bright spot at a bleak time for the industry: Retail beer sales for the first half of 2025 fell nearly 5% year over year to $34.7 billion, according to a recent analysis from Fintech and the National Beer Wholesalers Association.\n\nMichelob Ultra\u2019s growth can partly be attributed to increased spending on marketing, including on marquee sporting events, like the previous FIFA Club World Cup and the 2026 World Cup taking place next summer in the United States. Last year, Michelob Ultra surpassed Bud Light in its share of US draft lines at bars and restaurants."

Sales of Bud Light continued to suffer months after the campaign.\n\nAnson Frericks, a former Anheuser-Busch executive, told Fox News Digital at the time that the collaboration failed because \u201cthey just were not an authentic partnership at all.\u201d\n\nThat slip allowed Constellation Brands\u2019 Modelo Especial to become the top-selling beer in the US in 2023.\n\nIt was a brutal blow to Bud Light, which had held the title for more than two decades.\n\nConstellation \u2013 which also owns Corona beers \u2013 has continued to suffer from a sales slump, which its CEO has blamed on declining demand among Hispanic consumers, who account for roughly half of the beer giant\u2019s business.\n\nBill Newlands, chief executive of Constellation, said Hispanic buyers are pulling back due to economic concerns, like higher food prices and a weak job market, and immigration issues amid Trump\u2019s mass deportation efforts.\n\n\u201cBeer is quite a ways down the list, but it\u2019s certainly on the list because things like social gatherings, an area where the Hispanic consumer often consumes beer, are declining today as part of these overarching concerns that they have,\u201d Newlands said during an investor call.\n\nTariffs on aluminum and Mexican imports have also challenged beer makers.\n\nConstellation slashed its full-year forecast earlier this month to a 2% to 4% drop in net beer sales, down from previous expectations of flat sales to a 3% rise.\n\nShares in AB InBev have jumped 17% so far this year, while Constellation has fallen 40%."

Despite the dangers, Rojas emphasizes the importance of women working and proving their capabilities in a challenging environment, as she navigates both her profession and the risks associated with it.",
                "source": "cnn",
                "text": "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This story is part of \u2018The Great Illusion,\u2019 a series by CNN\u2019s As Equals all about work: investigating which industries are most harmful for women workers, revealing the true cost of care work, and exploring how it can be improved. For information about how CNN As Equals is funded and more, check out our FAQs.\n\nRuth Rojas got a flat tire almost as soon as she picked us up, so she slowed her little red car to a crawl. There was a tire shop four blocks away, an interminable distance at that speed with the evening heat and rush hour exhaust pouring through the open windows.\n\nBy the time we reached the tire shop, the sky was darkening and the sidewalk in front of the little shop partially blocked by a group of drunken men, one quietly vomiting between his knees.\n\nThe tire was just bad luck. After everything she\u2019d seen on the road, Rojas was cool about it; we\u2019d be back on route soon, she assured. A punctured tire is the least of the concerns of a female cabbie in Mexico City.\n\nIn a country where thousands of people disappear every year and mass graves keep turning up, surviving a night of work as a driver for hire can feel like a roll of the dice. A string of gory killings and assaults on both drivers and passengers in rideshare vehicles and taxis has focused national attention on the issue, with tabloid frontpages recounting women fatally jumping out of moving vehicles, abandoned on the side of the road by drivers, and raped by passengers.\n\nRojas let CNN ride along for an evening of driving. She tries to pick her rides as carefully as she can based on scant profile details and has an idea of high-crime \u201cred zones\u201d to avoid across the sprawling Mexican capital - but nevertheless she says she has already been assaulted multiple times, including at gunpoint, in seven years.\n\n\u201cI go into neighborhoods like Chimalhuac\u00e1n, Ixtapaluca, Cuautitl\u00e1n Izcalli, Atizap\u00e1n and see people selling drugs or robbing others on the street. It\u2019s very complicated and scary, but I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s part of my job,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter two hours at the shop watching the nearby pharmacy, chicken rotisserie, taco stand and ice cream shop shutter around us, the tire was finally patched. Her black hair pulled tightly back in the humidity, Rojas counted out 300 pesos (about $16 USD) to the mechanic sweating under a single bare lightbulb, and we set off again in the dark.\n\nTaxis for women, by women\n\nMarried at 17, Rojas spent most of her adult life raising kids, the youngest of whom had health problems that saw them in and out of hospital. Now 49, she finally has her own income and her own car, a carefully polished four-door Chevrolet watched over by a painted wooden folk-art dog glued to the dashboard. A feathered dream-catcher sways from her rearview mirror.\n\n\u201cI love to drive, I love to meet people in the car that I call my little cherry. This for me is my safe place, It\u2019s one of my safe places. There I cry, scream, sing, dance, cry out loud, everything and anything I feel like,\u201d she said.\n\nThree years ago, Rojas and her daughter Karina Alba, 29, decided to start their own driving business. Confident there would be demand for a safer service, they founded a collective of female cabbies called AmorrAs \u2013 a play on the Spanish words for love and women \u2013 which serves only female passengers.\n\nAmorrAs is part business, part solidarity group. In addition to drivers, some of its members are lawyers and psychologists, who offer pro-bono counsel for women navigating a dangerous city. Since launching in 2023, the group has cultivated a loyal following and now averages over 100 rides per month, according to Alba. Clients can book their services online or by phone, and every ride is monitored by a real person at the collective, who tracks the car\u2019s real time location and is available to respond in case of any issue.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly competition for the big ride apps \u2013 all of the group\u2019s 23 drivers also drive for various rideshare platforms on the side \u2013 but they prioritize AmorrAs bookings, at the relatively competitive rate of 5 pesos per kilometer, or 3 pesos per minute, with no surge pricing. According to Rojas and Alba, the collective has not experienced any dangerous incidents since it began operating.\n\nOne AmorrAs regular, entrepreneur Dulce Navarro, 41, books the service for monthly long-distance rides to visit her family out of town, and for late-night events like concerts.\n\nShe told CNN that she avoids public transport after a series of traumatic incidents. In 2021, her 21-year-old niece was found dead in a vacant lot shortly after boarding a bus in the state of Morelos, south of Mexico City. Then last year, she found herself yanking on the emergency alarm in a women-only subway car at Mexico City\u2019s Ciudad Azteca stop, after feeling the sting of a sudden injection \u2013 part of a trend of subway thefts involving forcible drugging, she believes.\n\n\u201cLuckily, I was able to pull on the car\u2019s emergency lever and the driver of the train helped me,\u201d Navarro said.\n\nPresident Claudia Sheinbaum has declared her term a \u201ctime for women\u201d and vowed to crack down on gender-based violence, while Mexico City in August launched a new division of police focused fighting on women-targeted crimes. Still, stories about friends or family members attacked or disappeared while trying to get somewhere are common here.\n\n\u201cI know friends whose mothers have disappeared, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they were involved in something bad, but rather that they went out to the store, to study, to work. Suddenly, your mother can disappear, or your niece from school,\u201d Navarro said.\n\nLocal and national authorities did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for updated statistics on violence in public and private transport in the country, but according to a 2018 UN Women report, nearly nine out of 10 women polled said they had experienced violence in public transportation or public spaces in Mexico City. In 2021, a Mexican government survey also found that 10% of women polled had experienced physical violence within the past year.\n\nLast month Mexico City officials announced plans for a new gender police unit, which will include 438 officers, who will carry out \u201cpreventive patrols, respond to emergencies, accompany victims, supervise protective measures in cases of femicide risk, and conduct door-to-door visits in high-incidence areas,\u201d the city\u2019s head of government and secretary of citizen security said in a statement.\n\nIt added that over the coming months, more than 3,000 officers from different sectors will be trained up in cases of domestic violence \u2013 enabling \u201cany police officer to respond to emergencies with a gender perspective.\u201d\n\nThe aim was \u201cmainstreaming\u201d the \u201cmarginalization that is often given to issues of gender,\u201d Michelle Guerra Sastre, head of the Specialized Gender Unit at the Secretariat of Citizen Security, Mexico City, told CNN in an interview. She added that they were \u201cimproving efficiency\u201d of \u201cfirst responders\u201d to crimes \u2013 including \u201cgender-based violence in public transport.\u201d\n\nPresident Claudia Sheinbaum did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on taxi and rideshare insecurity.\n\nThe rideshare apps\n\nIn some respects, Mexico leads the world in commitment to protecting gig workers like Rojas. A 2024 reform grants laborers on digital service platforms access to state benefits and rights once reserved for more traditional employees, including social security, pension, healthcare, and the right to unionize.\n\nBut guaranteeing their physical security is harder amid a wider epidemic of violence. While heavily-touristed parts of central Mexico City and coastal resort areas are carefully guarded by the country\u2019s armed forces, extremely high rates of violent crime plague many parts of the country, with over 31,000 homicides in 2023, according to Mexico\u2019s National Institute of Statistics and Geography.\n\nRojas works on the popular DiDi rideshare app during nights and weekends \u2013 the most lucrative hours and the riskiest time. More than half of her male fares hit on her, she estimates, and it can be difficult to get problem passengers out of her car when things get uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cIt has happened to me that when I get to my destination, I tell them to get out, and they don\u2019t want to leave. They\u2019ll say something like, \u2018I told you we\u2019re going to have sex,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOr they come doing drugs. Even if I say \u2018No, you can\u2019t do that here,\u2019 they say \u2018You drive, that\u2019s what I pay you for, right?\u2019 I think they would respond to a male driver differently.\u201d\n\nAttacks have been reported on all the major ridesharing apps in Mexico, as well as in metered cabs.\n\nMost rideshare companies offer security features like automated trip-tracking, passenger and driver ratings, and the ability to preview a destination. In Mexico, both the China-based DiDi Chuxing app and US-based Uber also include an emergency or \u201cSOS\u201d feature which connects users\u2019 phones to the local equivalent of 911, the ability to make audio recordings of rides, an automated detection of \u201canomalies\u201d like unusually long stops, and round-the-clock incident response teams. Both also allow female drivers to select only female passengers in certain locations.\n\nBut drivers keep dying. Earlier this year, protests erupted outside of Uber\u2019s Mexico City offices after Uber driver Karla Patricia Cort\u00e9s, a 41-year-old mother of two, was killed with a shot to the back of her head while working on a Sunday afternoon in December.\n\nCort\u00e9s, the sole provider for her family, had access to Uber\u2019s emergency safety features. She also used the Live360 location tracking app as a backup measure, according to her daughter Brisa Garc\u00eda. Uber says its security alert features were not used by Cort\u00e9s or third parties on the day of her death \u2013 the alarm was raised by another driver in Karla\u2019s Live 360 group, who noticed that her location had stopped for about 20 minutes and was deactivated, according to Ivone L\u00f3pez, a fellow driver in the group.\n\nHer last moments were recorded on December 29 by a local resident\u2019s security camera in the quiet Azcapotzalco neighborhood: Cort\u00e9s\u2019 white car parked innocuously in the residential street, the sudden crack of gunshots, and then her body pushed out of the passenger side onto the curb \u2013 along with a stuffed bear that she liked to keep in the car as a talisman.\n\nIt remains unclear why Cort\u00e9s was killed; earlier this year, a suspect was arrested about five hours away, in the central Mexican state Guanajuato, for his \u201cprobable involvement in her death,\u201d the Mexico City Attorney General\u2019s office said at the time. \u201cThe now arrested individual likely took the victim\u2019s life,\u201d read the statement.\n\nHe has not yet been formally charged, according to Garc\u00eda\u2019s attorney. The Attorney General\u2019s office did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nUber has said it is in touch with Brisa and has cooperated with local authorities about the case. In an interview with CNN, Uber Mexico\u2019s Safety Communication Manager Cecilia Roman noted that the company offers Spanish-speaking psychology and security experts as a resource to drivers, as well as a mental health helpline versed in gender issues specifically in Mexico.\n\nDiDi Mexico declined to comment on safety concerns about activity on its platform.\n\nA right to work\n\nIn the dark hush of Rojas\u2019 car, her first passenger pinged: A woman, according to her Didi profile, heading to an area on the outskirts of the city that Rojas evaluated as a \u201cyellow zone\u201d \u2013 not somewhere we\u2019d want to wait around, but an acceptable level of risk for a drop-off.\n\n\u201cYou never really know who will get in the car,\u201d she said, her gaze fixed on the road ahead. The fare turned out to be a grandmother, her daughter, her nephew and 1-year-old baby. They hustled down the street at the sight of Rojas\u2019 ruby-colored ride.\n\nAfter dropping them off in a narrow street, Rojas started swiping through the app for a new passenger. We were far from the city center now, and no one else was on the road, but she hardly looked up. After the delay of the flat tire, her working day was only just getting started as the clock approached midnight. A plastic bag packed with sandwiches and bottles of juice waited in the trunk for Rojas\u2019 eventual refueling.\n\nShe rejected one man in the nearby hills. \u201cThat\u2019s a really red zone,\u201d she muttered to herself. Then leaned back approvingly when the app next suggested a female passenger just 10 minutes away and tapped \u201caccept.\u201d\n\nIf it were up to Rojas\u2019 husband, she would stop working all together.\n\nBut in the context of Mexico\u2019s yearslong security crisis, that vein of advice taken to its logical conclusion would keep most women confined to within walking distance of their homes. Plus, Rojas still needs about four years to pay off the little red car that brings her so much joy.\n\nUnlike her daughter and some of the younger members of AmorrAs, Rojas says she\u2019s not a feminist \u2013 just a believer in the right to work.\n\n\u201cWe as women go out to work because we want to be useful. When a system tells us that we can\u2019t do something, or that we don\u2019t know how to do what men do \u2013 it\u2019s not self-centered to say \u2018I\u2019m going to prove that I can.\u2019 It is simply to avoid feeling diminished,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGoing to work is no reason for someone to come and take your life,\u201d Rojas added.\n\nCredits\n\nReporter: Caitlin Hu\n\nField producer: Melissa del Pozo\n\nCamera: Lali Houghton\n\nVideo editor: Estefania Rodriguez\n\nEditors: Sheena McKenzie, Rachel Clarke\n\nSenior Video Producer: Ladan Anoushfar\n\nSenior Visual Editor: Carlotta Dotto\n\nPhoto editor: Toby Hancock"

                "text": "In 2017, I gave birth to my son, and also a midlife crisis. Suddenly, my two-hour commute from our home in New York City to my job as an economist at the University of Pennsylvania went from inconvenient but sustainable to the bane of my existence. And my marriage, which had seemed flawed but in a cute, work-in-progress kind of way, suddenly seemed to be falling apart at the seams. At the same time, in my academic career, rejections were stacking up, and I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that my male colleagues, some of whom were going up for tenure years before I was, simply had more time in their days. Nor did I feel as if I was at the top of my game in other domains, constantly observing how much nicer other people\u2019s houses looked, how much better dressed their little bundles of joy were, how much more time they seemed to have to juggle motherhood, work, and coordinate everything therein.\n\nPerhaps the nadir of this period was when track repairs were taking place on my train line, and I spent a total of six hours commuting, only to work in my office for four. I pumped breast milk in the Amtrak bathroom, crying, because I wouldn\u2019t make it home in time to put my son to bed. I not only felt as though I didn\u2019t \u201chave it all\u201d; I felt as if I didn\u2019t have anything. Not the successful career I wanted, not the thriving family and home life I wanted, and I wasn\u2019t even the fun person I used to be, who travelled and laughed and enjoyed things. Most of all, I was So. Darn. Tired. All the time.\n\nIt\u2019s a refrain I\u2019ve heard time and again from working women, who feel as if they\u2019re constantly juggling and constantly dropping each ball, one by one. And it is not surprising. Gender roles have converged in the workplace, but not at home, leaving women playing both offence and defence. Women still do the majority of housework, regardless of whether they earn more or less than their male partners \u2013 in fact, a man who earns only 20% of the household income does about the same amount of housework as a man who earns 80%. Women in heterosexual marriages who are the primary breadwinners do almost twice as much cooking and cleaning as their male spouses. Added to that is an explosion of parenting time since the early 90s: mothers today spend twice as much time with their children as mothers a generation ago. Amid those pressures, women\u2019s wages have plateaued and our percentage in the upper echelons of management and paygrades has stalled.\n\nFor too long, women have been expected to accept unfairly labour-intensive, functionally unsustainable deals in all areas of work and life, and to somehow just make up the difference by working harder, optimising better, and, when that fails, \u201cself-care\u201d. But it\u2019s not working for us \u2013 women\u2019s happiness is measurably lower than it was 20 years ago \u2013 a figure that is even larger when considered relative to men, whose happiness has been improving. We cannot keep going in this direction. Something has to change.\n\nAfter my moment in the Amtrak train, I made some drastic changes. I ended my marriage, moved to Philadelphia, and traded a two-and-a-half-hour train ride for a seven-minute commute by bike. In Philly, I was able to afford enough space to have a live-in au pair, which meant having real help with my son for the first time.\n\nAs an economist whose research focuses on the decisions that shape women\u2019s lives and the economic and societal constraints they face when making them, I think the rationale for a lot of our decisions can be boiled down to a simple question: Am I getting a good deal? I don\u2019t want to gaslight you, suggesting the problems in our lives can be solved by one simple trick or lifehack. These problems are hard. But I want to help you ask for more \u2013 from your partner, from your boss and from the system itself.\n\nHow to get a good \u2013 or at least better \u2013 deal\n\nWork out your personal utility function\n\nIn the same way for-profit companies are assumed to be making choices to maximise their bottom line, economists view human beings as agents who maximise their own personal \u201cprofit\u201d function: utility. But unlike dollars and cents that can be counted, utility is a much more amorphous concept. One way to think of utility is as your personal video game score at the end of your life. Except you decide what gives you points, because only you know your values and priorities.\n\nImportantly, you cannot compare yourself with people who don\u2019t have the same utility function as you do. We fall into this trap all the time: you might find the greatest utility in volunteer work or travel, activities that don\u2019t leave you with a lot of time at home. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with that. But \u2013 and this is the trap \u2013 suddenly when you visit a friend who finds great utility in homemaking, or from-scratch cooking, you start to feel as if you are failing. This is not a failure \u2013 it is a difference in utility function.\n\nMaximise subject to constraints\n\nWhen I was one semester away from graduation, I shared with a female professor that I was hoping to pursue an economics PhD, but first, I had taken a job with McKinsey & Company. Her aghast expression surprised me. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can\u2019t do that. Two years at McKinsey, six-year PhD, two-year postdoc, seven-year tenure track \u2026\u201d Then, with great urgency: \u201cYou\u2019re never going to have kids!\u201d At the time, I felt taken aback, and maybe even a little offended, but I also knew she was right. If I wanted to have kids, I had to think about how it all added up, in a way that men just didn\u2019t need to consider.\n\nMost people face constraints, from financial to social to time, but women \u2013 even if they never have kids \u2013 have more. Just as we can\u2019t compare ourselves to people who don\u2019t have the same utility function, you must not compare yourself to people who don\u2019t face the same constraints. We may all be in the same game, but some of us have more protective equipment.\n\nWork like a girl\n\nSure, there are tips I give my students. Say, \u201cThank you for helping\u201d, instead of apologising for a problem beyond your control. Learn to take up space \u2013 look at men who ask questions in class, and see how comfortable they are taking up other people\u2019s time to get their own needs met. We can all fine-tune our communication skills. But I want you to separate this from a need to change who you are.\n\nThere is a canonical paper written by two experimental economists, Muriel Niederle and Lise Vesterlund, titled \u201cDo Women Shy Away from Competition? Do Men Compete Too Much?\u201d and the authors have told me people always forget about that second part (the answer is yes; 60% of low-performing men choose a competition they\u2019re destined to lose over a certain payout). Why don\u2019t we spend as much time speculating that male over-competitiveness might be destroying corporate value as we do asking women to change, to be more cut-throat, to lean in? I think about Christine Lagarde\u2019s suggestion, that if it was \u201cLehman Sisters instead of Lehman Brothers\u201d, perhaps there wouldn\u2019t have been so much over-indexing on high-risk mortgage securities, and the financial crisis wouldn\u2019t have been as bad.\n\nWomen are often also described as bad negotiators, but my own research has found that men are more than twice as likely to fail to reach an agreement, and therefore walk away from a negotiation with nothing. What holds women back is lacking assurance they won\u2019t be penalised for it, not the skill or the will. So let\u2019s get out of the mindset of telling women they need to change the way they approach work and start talking about the unique value they bring to the table.\n\nGet more than you give at work\n\nAt every stage I want you to think about the balance of trade between you and your employer: how much are you giving, and how much are you getting? In a world where harassment, discrimination and microaggressions often stop women from earning as much as men, what can you do to ensure you are getting more than you give? Even if you love your job, or at least some people there, remember that your employer will never love you back. Their objective is to maximise profit. Yours is to maximise your own utility. Your interests may overlap at times, but, fundamentally, they are not shared.\n\nAnd, very importantly, understand the difference between a job and a passion project.\n\nInvest in the right partner\n\nTrust me, I know that \u201cthe heart wants what it wants.\u201d But having feelings for someone is what economists call a \u201cnecessary but not sufficient condition\u201d. As in \u2013 it\u2019s necessary for a relationship to be successful. But it isn\u2019t enough.\n\nI want you to go into the process of choosing a significant other armed not just with your innate sense of who you\u2019re attracted to, but also the savviness to think about who is going to make a good partner in the enterprise of running a household and the other things you need to weather.\n\nWearing my economist\u2019s hat, I often think about dating as a job interview. So even in those heady early days when all you want to do is talk about your favourite bands and movies, or moral philosophy, or whatever your jam is, I urge women to also ask tactical questions such as: \u201cWho does your laundry?\u201d, \u201cWhat do you like to cook for dinner?\u201d After all, when interviewing someone for a job, you wouldn\u2019t just ask about their opinions \u2013 you would ask about their experience, preparation and demonstrated track record.\n\nMake a relationship performance-improvement plan\n\nJust like we shouldn\u2019t settle for a partner, we shouldn\u2019t settle for a \u201cdeal\u201d with the partner we\u2019ve already chosen that leaves us exhausted and depleted. In that spirit, if you\u2019re finding that the joint load is falling on your shoulders, and love is fizzling, you need to have tough conversations and reset the terms of your relationship. I\u2019m going to focus here mostly on an unequal division of home production, because this is so often the challenge that I see driving relationships with two reasonable people, that were once filled with love, into the ground.\n\nGet two sheets of graph paper, or open up a Google spreadsheet, and write out seven days with 15-minute intervals from the earliest time you could possibly wake up to the latest you go to bed. If you have a baby who wakes up at night, you\u2019ll need slots for the overnight, too. Then, for one week, fill out what you do in each of those 15-minute slots. You both have to do it for this to work! If you\u2019re multitasking and taking care of someone else and yourself, write that, too \u2013 \u201cDid my hair while getting kiddo dressed.\u201d And remember, for these purposes, even if you enjoy packing your child\u2019s lunch every day, it\u2019s childcare.\n\nHousehold management is a big one \u2013 use that category any time you\u2019re thinking or emailing or calling or researching online about something household-related. Your partner might be shocked \u2013 and you might be, too \u2013 at how little time you actually have for work, for personal care, for social connection, for exercise. For enjoying all the other things that make up parts of your utility function.\n\nCreate specialisation in your relationship\n\nThen it\u2019s time to look at the data. Who is actually spending more time on which tasks? Are there any areas that surprise you? You might find that some of the places you\u2019re overburdened are those where both people agree something needs to be done but don\u2019t agree on how much work it should require. Others might be tasks that your partner didn\u2019t even realise existed \u2013 like the fact that the kids\u2019 summer camp schedule doesn\u2019t magically materialise but rather takes hours of researching, calling and paperwork.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to begin reallocating the workload. But where to start? I\u2019m partial to Eve Rodsky\u2019s Fair Play method of divvying up tasks wholesale \u2013 like dealing out a deck of cards (you can actually buy the cards to do it online). The reason I think it works is that if you assign someone part of a task, you still end up with the \u201chousehold management\u201d piece of it \u2013 conceptualising what needs to be done, managing it, monitoring progress. The women I know who are happiest in their marriages are those who say: \u201cOh, I don\u2019t cook at all.\u201d Men have been weaponising incompetence for decades, and it\u2019s high time we got hip to it.\n\nWill this need readjustment and renegotiation? Definitely. But is it better than you trying to do everything, being exhausted, and resenting your family instead of spending quality time with them? Also yes.\n\nPay yourself first, with time\n\n\u201cPay yourself first\u201d is a personal finance adage that refers to putting money into savings or investments before you do the rest of your budgeting. The idea is that by taking the liquid cash out immediately, and putting it toward long-term goals, you reel in some of the behavioural forces that sometimes cause us to make \u201cmistakes\u201d that run counter to our long-term interests.\n\nLeisure time must be accounted for in advance and treated as a sacred obligation, just like a meeting with your boss, instead of the \u201ctreat\u201d you\u2019re allowed to have if you get through your entire to-do list. Because the to-do list will always be there, but time will not. Surprisingly, planning for this time can make you feel as if you have more time, instead of less.\n\nOutsource\n\nI\u2019d like to note how much more comfortable society is in outsourcing male-coded tasks than female-coded tasks. Hiring a handyman to clean the gutters, or painters to touch up the house is considered a norm, because we assume that men\u2019s time can be valuably spent earning money on the market instead of insourcing home production. But when it comes to female-coded tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and childcare, we suddenly feel as if the budget to hire someone is an unaffordable luxury rather than a basic requirement.\n\nSo take a truly comprehensive view of the cost of insourcing a task \u2013 of hiring yourself for it \u2013 which includes the time, the cost of materials, the stress of doing it, and take a hard look at whether investing that time in your career or just in your sanity would have payoffs beyond the cost of something that feels a little out of reach.\n\nIf paying to outsource labour isn\u2019t an option for you, can you trade tasks with friends, create car pools, or just invest in simplifying your life so certain things don\u2019t need to happen?\n\nYou need to be ruthless. I think of it as Marie Kondo, but for time.\n\nConvert time into joy and meaning\n\nIn choosing how we want to spend our time, we have to get used to listening to a different part of ourselves \u2013 the constant, omnipresent part who will be with us through our entire lives \u2013 rather than the temporary flares of chemicals and emotions (guilt, flattery, unhelpful social norms, algorithms) that create internal chatter. I want you to practise turning up the volume on your inner truths about what you are seeking in life and turning down the volume on the other forces pulling you away from that.\n\nWith so many demands on us, it is all too easy for women to forget that we are the protagonists of our own lives. We cannot keep meeting everyone else\u2019s needs and putting ourselves last. It\u2019s time to start writing our own stories.\n\nThis is an edited extract from Femonomics: What Data Tells Us About Women\u2019s Lives and How to Get the Most Out of Yours, which is published by Hodder Press (\u00a322) on 25 September.

Think again, the frequent flyer revealed.\n\n\u201cEveryone seems to think that life between two countries is the dream, but let me tell you why it\u2019s not,\u201d El Refai, 32, explained to her more than 11,000 Instagram fans, in a clip titled \u201cThe not so glamorous life of dual living.\u201d\n\nOnline, however, she gave virtual viewers the down-low on the lows of being bicontinental, which include constantly readjusting to a nine-hour time difference, feeling disconnected from loved ones in both locations, living out of suitcases and never quite feeling \u201c100% home in either place.\u201d\n\nEl Refai is among a growing number of people living the here today, gone tomorrow, supercommuter life \u2014 a common term for business folks who routinely hoof it long distances, hopping planes, trains and/or automobiles to and from work and home.\n\nUnfortunately, the incessant travel comes at a high price, often costing long-haul jobholders exorbitant amounts of time and money.\n\nBut some of the unique 9-to-5ers claim the payoff is well worth the pinch.\n\nKyle Rice, an EMS software developer, shells out over $1,500 each month on supercommuting expenses between his residence in New Castle, Del., and his office in Manhattan. The hassle of catching multiple trains across four states aside, the married father takes home a handsome six-figure, big city income.\n\nKaitlin Jay, an Upper West Side hairdresser, previously told The Post she doesn\u2019t mind regularly making the 600-mile hike between NYC and her new residence in Charlotte, NC \u2014 trips that cost $1,000 a month with flights, ground transportation, food and rent.\n\nThe cosmetologist found that it\u2019s financially beneficial to supercommute into the Big Apple, where she makes the big bucks, and plant roots down South, where the cost of living is less pricey than city dwelling.\n\nMoney was, too, a factor in El Refai\u2019s decision to supercommute from Europe to the US on a regular basis \u2014 which can come with a price tag of around $450 for each round-trip flight.\n\nShe and her husband moved to Sweden in December, owing to the country\u2019s reputation for being a \u201chappy\u201d place in which to raise a family, per Business Insider.\n\nThe couple\u2019s apartment, a rental nest they share with a toddler daughter, costs less than $1,500 a month. And rather than maintaining and fueling a car, the twosome saves money by taking public transportation.\n\nWhen she\u2019s back on American soil for work, El Refai spends 10 days covering a cluster of nursing shifts at a San Francisco Bay Area hospital. During her work-stays, she rents a room for $50 per night from a colleague.\n\nEl Refai did not immediately respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAnd while the jetsetting healer has to pay taxes in both America and Sweden, that\u2019s not an issue, she said.\n\n\u201cIt is financially worth it because the salary in the Bay Area is just so high, and the cost of living in Sweden is a lot less than \u2026 California,\u201d she said in a viral TikTok vid. \u201cWhen I work for 10 days straight, it\u2019s basically enough money to cover a few months of bills in Sweden.\u201d\n\nShe concedes that the commute is \u201cabsolutely outrageous,\u201d but says the work-life balance it offers is a prime perk.\n\n\u201cImagine having six weeks off after working 10 days on a repeated pattern,\u201d said El Refai in the post. \u201cIt basically feels like I\u2019m a stay-at-home mom \u2026 and I am basically free to do anything I want to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is something that no 9-to-5 job will ever give me.\u201d"

The more pounds a bear packs on, the better chance they have of surviving their six-month hibernation.\n\nBut the contest isn\u2019t just about which bear gains the most weight.\n\nRather, it\u2019s about trying to \u201cfind the bear who best exemplifies fatness and success,\u201d as per the national park\u2019s website.\n\nThe vote is done in a March Madness-style bracket, with winners of previous rounds going up against each other until only one chonker remains. While there is a separate contest, Fat Bear Junior, for younger bears, Fat Bear Week is the main event.\n\n\u201cYou can vote for the bear who is fattest, you can vote for the bear whose story touches your heart \u2013 it\u2019s up to you,\u201d Naomi Boak, a media ranger for Katmai National Park, told CNN\u2019s Polo Sandoval. \u201cThe bears don\u2019t know who you voted for.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s crop of ultra-ursines include two previous winners: 32 Chunk, a mammoth male who is hoping to make a comeback after a broken jaw and 128 Grazer, a fearsome fisher who won the Fat Bear Week crown in 2023 and 2024 and whose cub just snagged the Fat Bear Week junior title.\n\nOther hopefuls are 503, an up-and-coming male who has showed a remarkable ability to get along with others, 26, a female who is devotedly raising cubs after losing a previous litter, and 602, whose tendency to nap in the river mid-fishing expedition has garnered comparisons to Homer Simpson and the nickname \u201cflotato.\u201d\n\nVoting begins at 9:00 am EST on Tuesday, and the winner will be announced on September 30.\n\nThere\u2019s some good news ahead of this year\u2019s contest. Boak reports that the bears had more salmon than ever before to feast on in the Brooks River this year.\n\nIn addition to casting their votes, bear lovers can donate to The Otis Fund, whose proceeds go toward protecting Katmai National Park and Preserve, which is the fourth-largest national park in the United States.\n\nIt is named in honor of Otis, the renowned chonkster who was the recipient of the first-ever Fat Bear Week title and went on to win the crown again in 2016, 2017 and 2021. He has not been seen in several years and is presumed dead, but his legacy lives on.\n\n\u201cHe was our Zen master,\u201d Boak said about Otis. \u201cHe was recorded catching 42 fish in an hour. He deserved to be champion.\u201d\n\nNow in its 11th year, Fat Bear Week actually began as Fat Bear Tuesday in 2014. To the happy surprise of park rangers, about 1,700 people voted for their favorite bears.\n\nThat spurred Katmai staff to expand the event to last a full week, adding regular updates, a \u201cHall of Champions,\u201d and a live feed on their website.\n\nCompare that to 2024, where more than 1.4 million people from 60 countries cast votes, according to Boak.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s grown enormously,\u201d she said. \u201cLike the bears.\u201d"

                "text": "The 45th edition of the Ryder Cup will kick off this Friday in Farmingdale, New York. The premier team event in pro golf, the biennial competition pits stars from the United States against those from Europe in a thrilling battle for bragging rights.\n\nThe tournament features multiple formats and unique rules, and there will be some tweaks in 2025. For those familiar with the continental rivalry, things will feel quite familiar. For casual PGA fans, however, they may not.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of what you need to know for this year's tournament.\n\nFormat and Rules\n\n3 of 3\n\nHENRY NICHOLLS / AFP\n\nRory McIlroy\n\nThe Ryder Cup is always intriguing because it features a variety of match variants. The schedule for the first two days is chosen by the home team captain ahead of the tournament.\n\nFriday morning will feature four alternate-shot foursome matches, while Friday afternoon will bring four fourball matches. Fourball is a best-ball format in which both players on each team shoot and only the best shot counts.\n\nSaturday's schedule will also bring four foursome matches in the morning and four fourball matches in the afternoon. The tournament will wrap on Sunday with 12 singles matches.\n\nEvery member of each team is required to play on Sunday, but there is no limit to how many times a golfer may play on Friday and Saturday. Rory McIlroy, for example, played in all four opening rounds in the 2023 tournament.\n\nMatches will be played to a maximum of 18 holes and are worth one point apiece. Any match tied after 18 holes will end in a draw and will reward each team with a half-point.\n\nSince the Europeans are the defending champions, they can retain the Ryder Cup by recording 14 points. The Americans must reach 14\u00bd points to win it.\n\nOne minor rule change was implemented this year, after it was approved by Donald and the European team. The change would have allowed Bradley\u2014who finished 11th in Ryder Cup points\u2014to use an assistant as a de facto captain if he had picked himself to play."

                "text": "Patrick Reed believes it \u201cunnecessary\u201d that his fellow Americans will be paid for participation in the upcoming Ryder Cup. Reed, who has missed out on what would have been a fourth Ryder Cup appearance at Bethpage, also said Europe carry the advantage of having the more closely knit team.\n\nUS players plus their captain, Keegan Bradley, will be given $500,000 (\u00a3368,300) \u2013 $300,000 (\u00a3221,000) of which must be donated to charity \u2013 for taking on Luke Donald\u2019s Europe. The remaining $200,000 (\u00a3147,320) has been labelled a stipend. The topic was largely lost in fevered discussion over whether or not Bradley would pick himself as a player but remains hugely significant. Europe\u2019s contingent have always been adamant they will not seek monetary reward for Ryder Cup appearances.\n\nReed, once nicknamed Captain America for his theatrics in the Ryder Cup, falls on the side of the Europeans in this debate. \u201cI never played in that event and cared about playing it for money,\u201d said the former Masters champion. \u201cIt was all about playing, representing my country and trying to win the cup. It\u2019s just like playing in the Olympics; once every four years and it just means something to go out there and play for your country. There\u2019s no dollar amount that I would want to play in a Ryder Cup or play in an Olympics.\n\n\u201cI really think it is unnecessary. There are certain events that money means absolutely nothing and that\u2019s one of them. If you\u2019re going to give money to players, have it all go to their charity or something like that. Do something good with it.\u201d\n\nReed was speaking after an opening round of 69 at Wentworth\u2019s PGA Championship. On regular trips to this side of the Atlantic, he has observed the bond between European players.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all eating together,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThe actual brotherhood and camaraderie out here, you don\u2019t really have in the States. Here, you\u2019re jumping country to country, not state to state. So travel just comes out that much harder.\n\n\u201cI feel like they play a lot of team golf over here, growing up and everything. We don\u2019t, even though you\u2019re playing high school, college, there\u2019s not a lot of team format. It\u2019s go out, play individual. You count four, five scores and you move on. That\u2019s definitely an edge that they have over here, the camaraderie and the tightness of the group. But I feel like we\u2019ve recognised that in the US, and we\u2019re working on it.\u201d\n\nTom Vaillant and Ludvig \u00c5berg set the early pace in Surrey with eight-under par 64s. Thursday\u2019s play was halted for 90 minutes in the early afternoon due to the threat of lightning. As the siren blew, Matt Fitzpatrick had just whacked his tee shot at the final hole into foliage. What happened next did the Englishman a favour.\n\nFitzpatrick explained: \u201cDan, my caddie asked: \u2018What happens if someone goes sniffing around in the bushes and finds your ball, and decides to pocket it?\u2019 I thought that was a great point, because there had to be a good chance of that happening. So we called over a referee and explained the situation and asked whether we should look for the ball then, rather than risk it being taken.\n\n\u201cHe took us over to the crowd where we reckoned my ball would have landed. A few people there said they\u2019d seen two young boys dive into the bushes and come out grinning with a golf ball. So we decided the balance of probability was that it was my ball, and that I would take a drop in that spot when we got back.\n\n\u201cI made a six but if I\u2019d had to play my provisional ball it could have been worse. So those two little thieves who made off with my ball probably saved me a shot.\u201d Fitzpatrick signed for a 66. Rory McIlroy made a bogey at the last en route to a 69."

When I hear that [there will be bad behavior], it\u2019s coming from someone that doesn\u2019t understand this market, someone maybe doesn\u2019t appreciate these fans for who they are.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s yahoos at every Ryder Cup, and the fact is we\u2019ll deal with them very quickly \u2014 there\u2019s really zero tolerance.

It\u2019s maybe the most underrated part about this city in my opinion.\u2019\u2019\n\nKarns estimated that some 50,000 to 55,000 fans will be at the matches from Thursday-Sunday.\n\nHe declined to reveal the number of N.Y. State Police that will be deployed for the week, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re asked not to share that publicly, but to give any indication of what the comprehensive security plan is, this is obviously a big task for New York State Police and it\u2019s an all-hands-on-deck situation.\u2019\u2019\n\nKarns, who\u2019s a native of Oklahoma, has immersed himself in New York and its sports scene while living here for three years and building this Ryder Cup. He\u2019s attended Yankees and Mets games, gone to the Garden to see the Knicks and Rangers, been to MetLife for Giants and Jets games. Along the way, he\u2019s made observations.\n\n\u201cI think New York sports fans are incredibly smart,\u2019\u2019 Karns said. \u201cI think what\u2019s going to shock people is that it\u2019s going to be less about anything directed at the other team and more about cheering on their own team.\u2019\u2019\n\nComplicating logistical matters is President Trump having announced that he plans to come to the Friday session, which has potential to thwart entrance for the general public, particularly if he comes to the morning session, which begins with first balls in the air at 7:10.\n\nTrump\u2019s attendance at the U.S. Open tennis final last month delayed the match because fans had issues getting into the facility because of heightened security.\n\nThough Karns wouldn\u2019t confirm or deny, there are indications that the PGA of America has recommended to Trump\u2019s Secret Service detail that attending in the afternoon Friday would be better logistically.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still finalizing all that,\u2019\u2019 Karns said. \u201cI think [Trump] more than anything wants to ensure that the disruption is minimal and that he doesn\u2019t do anything to detract from the event.\u2019\u2019\n\nU.S. captain Keegan Bradley said he\u2019s \u201cdeeply honored\u2019\u2019 that Trump plans to attend.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re representing your country at a place like Bethpage Black in New York, having the president there to support you is something that is just absolutely incredible,\u2019\u2019 Bradley said.\n\n\u201cAnytime a sitting president wants to come to an event, it just shows how big the Ryder Cup is,\u2019\u2019 European captain Luke Donald said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to see that as a mark of respect. He knows a lot of the players.\u2019\u2019\n\nAmong those players is Scottie Scheffler, the world\u2019s No. 1 player."

                "text": "A Missouri woman was sentenced Tuesday to more than four years in federal prison for scheming to defraud Elvis Presley\u2019s family by trying to auction off his Graceland home and property before a judge halted the brazen foreclosure sale.\n\nU.S. District Judge John T. Fowlkes Jr. sentenced Lisa Jeanine Findley in federal court in Memphis to four years and nine months behind bars, plus an additional three years of probation. Findley, 54, declined to speak on her own behalf during the hearing.\n\nFindley pleaded guilty in February to a charge of mail fraud related to the scheme. She also had been indicted on a charge of aggravated identity theft, but that charge was dropped as part of a plea agreement.\n\nFindley, of Kimberling City, falsely claimed Presley\u2019s daughter borrowed $3.8 million from a bogus private lender and had pledged Graceland as collateral for the loan before her death in January 2023, prosecutors said when Findley was charged in August 2024. She then threatened to sell Graceland to the highest bidder if Presley\u2019s family didn\u2019t pay a $2.85 million settlement, according to authorities.\n\nFindley posed as three different people allegedly involved with the fake lender, fabricated loan documents and published a fraudulent foreclosure notice in a Memphis newspaper announcing the auction of Graceland in May 2024, prosecutors said. A judge stopped the sale after Presley\u2019s granddaughter sued.\n\nExperts were baffled by the attempt to sell off one of the most storied pieces of real estate in the country using names, emails and documents that were quickly suspected to be phony.\n\nGraceland opened as a museum and tourist attraction in 1982 and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. A large Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street from the museum is owned by Elvis Presley Enterprises. Presley died in August 1977 at the age of 42.\n\nThe public notice for the foreclosure sale of the 13-acre (5-hectare) estate said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Actor Riley Keough, Presley\u2019s granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after the death of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley.\n\nKeough filed a lawsuit claiming fraud, and a judge halted the proposed auction with an injunction. Naussany Investments and Private Lending \u2014 the bogus lender authorities say Findley created \u2014 said Lisa Marie Presley had used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Keough\u2019s lawsuit alleged that Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and that Lisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany.\n\nKimberly Philbrick, the notary whose name is listed on Naussany\u2019s documents, indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley nor notarized any documents for her, according to the estate\u2019s lawsuit. The judge said the notary\u2019s affidavit brought into question the authenticity of the signature.\n\nIn halting the foreclosure sale, the judge said Elvis Presley\u2019s estate could be successful in arguing that a company\u2019s attempt to auction Graceland was fraudulent.\n\nA statement emailed to The Associated Press after the judge stopped the sale said Naussany would not proceed with the sale because a key document in the case and the loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \u201clegal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\u201d The statement, sent from an email address for Naussany listed in court documents, did not specify the other state.\n\nAfter the scheme fell apart, Findley, who has a criminal history that includes attempts at passing bad checks, tried to make it look like the person responsible was a Nigerian identity thief, prosecutors said. An email sent May 25, 2024, to the AP from the same email as the earlier statement said in Spanish that the foreclosure sale attempt was made by a Nigerian fraud ring that targets old and dead people in the US and uses the internet to steal money.\n\nIn arguing for a three-year sentence, defense attorney Tyrone Paylor noted that Presley\u2019s estate did not suffer any loss of money and countered the prosecution\u2019s stance that the scheme was executed in a sophisticated manner.\n\nFowlkes, the judge, said it would have been a \u201ctravesty of justice\u201d if the sale had been completed.\n\n\u201cThis was a highly sophisticated scheme to defraud,\u201d he said."

I could structure my work around when they were at school.\u201d\n\nWhile Banks \u201creally didn\u2019t understand what the big deal was\u201d, she said she decided to keep the intimate details of her adult job from her children until they were old enough to understand.\n\nHowever, she soon realized she couldn\u2019t stop other people in her life from casting judgement, with some even taking great lengths to expose her.\n\n\u201cPeople have a real fascination with sex workers and adult creators. I had multiple people from my \u2018real life\u2019 subscribe and be weird with me,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cThey would feed me facts about my life, to scare me and show that they actually knew me. I also had people screenshot my content and send it around.\u201d\n\nShe said that despite making a \u201chuge effort\u201d to keep her work and personal life separate, those who were offended by her new job started reporting her to various authorities, claiming she was a \u201cterrible mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese people were calling my kids school, the police and child protection. It was overwhelming at some points, and it made me extremely skeptical about who I could trust,\u201d Banks told news.com.au.\n\n\u201cBeing a mother is such an intrinsic part of me. It\u2019s everything.\n\n\u201cAs much as being accused of being a bad mother really stung, it was awful, I quickly snapped out of it. I\u2019m an exceptional mother. Anyone who is in my network, and who actually knows me, will tell you, I would do anything for my kids.\u201d\n\nAfter one particularly concerning encounter with a subscriber, Banks ended up calling police, only for the officer to reveal he\u2019d received five complaints about her.\n\nThankfully, the cop said she was \u201cnot under suspicion\u201d, but it made her realize just how often women are judged.\n\n\u201cIf I stayed in banking and had my kids in daycare every day 6am \u2013 6pm, people would have judged,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cIf I lived off Centrelink and child support, people would have judged.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t work at all and stopped providing for my children, people would have judged.\n\n\u201cI would have been judged and criticized with any option I chose, so I went for the option that had the potential to set us up financially, while enabling me to be a present parent.\u201d\n\nBut as her success grew online, the downside was Banks was less able to shield her kids, and eventually she was outed to her eldest son.\n\n\u201cMy son was 10 at the time, and he just asked me straight out, \u2018Mom, do you do OnlyFans?\u2019\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cI was always going to have that conversation with them. I had only kept my children away from anything like that because it\u2019s not age appropriate.\n\n\u201cSo it was really disappointing that someone else had taken it upon themselves to tell my young son about it.\n\n\u201cI spent years shielding and keeping my kids away from anything inappropriate and I did a great job of that.\u201d\n\nIn total, Banks earned over $1.5 million during her four year career on OnlyFans, with her stint in the X-rated industry even spawning the idea that enabled her to leave the sex industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still heavily involved in the industry, but it was the right time for me to step back a bit,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI founded Million Billion Media, the first PR and marketing agency for the adult industry. \u201cThis year, my company also acquired the Adult Industry Choice Awards. It\u2019s a gala evening in November where the industry leaders and newcomers are recognized. It\u2019s a great space to work in, it\u2019s surprisingly wholesome.\u201d\n\nShe said that while people are still curious about what her kids thought of her work, past and present, \u201cthey don\u2019t really care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re typical kids. They are much more concerned about getting McDonald\u2019s for dinner and playing their sports.\n\n\u201cMy job has meant I\u2019ve been able to support my kids, and I am really proud of that. They go to great private schools, they do sports, they have stability.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not spoiled by any means.

It\u2019s when \u201cyou turn on your water tap and no water comes out,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nDay-zero droughts arise from the confluence of various factors, including a prolonged dearth of rain, low river levels and shrunken reservoirs, as well as rocketing water demand to supply people, farms and industries.\n\nNearly three-quarters of drought-prone regions, including those with major reservoirs, face a high risk of severe and persistent droughts by the end of the century if humans keep burning planet-heating fossil fuels, the study found.\n\nMore than a third of these regions, including the western United States, could face this situation as early as the 2020s or 2030s. The finding that day-zero droughts could happen so soon, at current levels of global warming, was \u201csomething that surprised us,\u201d Franzke said, even though a few cities have already come perilously close.\n\nCape Town, South Africa, faced a dire crisis in 2017 and 2018 after one of its most severe multi-year droughts on record. It narrowly avoided disaster thanks to extreme water saving measures and above average rain in 2018.\n\nChennai in southeastern India came very close to running out of water in 2019, as the monsoon rains failed and and reservoir levels plummeted. Water was trucked into neighborhoods with residents forced to line up for hours in the baking heat.\n\nMany cities are currently battling to avoid day zero, from Tehran and Kabul to Mexico City and Los Angeles.\n\nCities are particularly at risk as booming populations increase demand on water resources already under pressure from climate change and mismanagement. Low-income communities are expected to be disproportionately affected, the study found.\n\nSome parts of the world, including the Mediterranean, southern Africa, Asia and Australia, are projected to endure more prolonged day-zero drought events with less time between each one, limiting their ability to recover, the report found. This can have devastating effects on agriculture and ecosystems, and for some particularly badly affected areas, it throws into question \u201cwhether people might still be able to live there long term,\u201d Franzke said.\n\nThe findings point to the clear need to speed up the clean energy transition, he said, as well as improve water management \u2014 huge amounts are wasted through leaky pipes, for example.\n\nThe research should also guide industry, he added, pointing to the proliferation of water-guzzling semiconductor manufacturing and data centers in water-stressed areas such as Texas and Arizona.\n\nOne limitation with the study is that it doesn\u2019t include groundwater resources in its calculations as they weren\u2019t included in the models the scientists used, but Franzke said they have some measures in their analysis to help account for this.\n\nRichard Allan, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading who was not involved in the research, said it was \u201cimportant new evidence for how drought will emerge as climate warming combines with the demands for fresh water by societies.\u201d\n\nThe research is a \u201cguide rather than a perfect prediction,\u201d Allan told CNN, but, it \u201cpaints a picture of an increasing attack on water resources from multiple fronts that is already emerging.\u201d"

                "article_summary": "The Trump administration has issued a stop-work order on the Empire Wind 1 project, which aims to build offshore wind turbines to power 500,000 homes and create over 1,500 jobs in downstate New York. This halt, prompted by concerns over the project's approval process, threatens New York's renewable energy goals and the economic benefits for low-income communities, particularly in Sunset Park. The order raises concerns about future project stability and the potential for delays in the state's transition to renewable energy.",
                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "This story was originally published by Inside Climate News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nThe buildout of renewable energy projects in downstate New York \u2013 the region that includes the Hudson valley and below \u2013 is often complicated. The space for these projects is limited, particularly in New York City, and they\u2019re often expensive.\n\nThough an approach of smaller battery storage and solar projects could inch the state closer to its ambitious renewable energy goals, it must be complemented by utility-scale renewable energy generation.\n\nThat\u2019s where Empire Wind 1, the first project in a massive buildout of offshore wind off the coast of Long Island, came in. The project, which was granted a lease from the federal government in 2017, promised to create more than 1,500 jobs and ultimately power 500,000 homes by building 54 wind turbines.\n\nOn Wednesday, the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, instructed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to halt all construction on the project \u201cuntil further review of information that suggests the Biden administration rushed through its approval without sufficient analysis\u201d.\n\nSince taking office in January, Donald Trump has expressed strong opposition to offshore wind energy, saying he would not support \u201cbig, ugly windmills\u201d that threaten wildlife. In February, his administration fired National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration employees who were monitoring the impacts of offshore wind projects on marine wildlife.\n\nOn his first day in office, the president signed an executive order that withdrew all parts of the outer continental shelf from new or renewed offshore leasing activity and suspended the approval process for all new onshore and offshore wind projects. The executive order also directed a review of all existing offshore leases, with termination possible.\n\nA spokesperson for Equinor, the Norwegian energy company behind Empire Wind 1, said construction will halt on the project. Empire Offshore Wind LLC, the limited liability company in charge of the project, is \u201cengaging with relevant authorities to clarify this matter and is considering its legal remedies, including appealing the order\u201d, the spokesperson said in email.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s stop-work order could have important ramifications for New York state\u2019s climate goals and the growth of green job opportunities in the downstate region. About 44% of New York City\u2019s census tracts are home to low-income communities who have experienced a disproportionate amount of negative impacts from pollution.\n\nWhen climate targets are delayed, or entry-level job opportunities do not materialize, these communities are often the first to suffer.\n\nThe Empire Wind 1 project promised to bring green union jobs to the downstate region. Equinor is working to redevelop the marine terminal, which will house the project\u2019s long-term operations and maintenance base, in conjunction with the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the terminal operator Sustainable South Brooklyn Marine Terminal.\n\nThis is especially beneficial for the New York City neighborhood of Sunset Park, an environmentally overburdened community located near the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, which fought to be included in the plans.\n\n\u201cOur community has fought for years to ensure that Sunset Park would be part of solutions to reduce carbon emissions, build healthier and green energy, and provide new local union jobs,\u201d said a statement from the office of council member Alexa Avil\u00e9s, who represents the city district that encompasses Sunset Park.\n\nThese projects are slated to include at least 1,000 construction jobs, 130 apprentices, 200 assembly jobs at the marine terminal and 50 permanent, long-term jobs to keep the Empire Wind project up and running, according to the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nThe city has viewed green jobs as a pathway for low-income New Yorkers, or those without a college degree, to increase their earning potential. But as green job growth has slowed, big projects such as Empire Wind 1 have become even more important.\n\n\u201cThe reckless and overreaching move to halt construction that is already underway on Empire Wind threatens thousands of good union jobs and jeopardizes the progress New York has made toward cleaner, more affordable energy,\u201d wrote Vincent Alvarez, the president of the New York City Central Labor Council, in a statement.\n\nEsther Rosario, the executive director of the labor union coalition Climate Jobs NY, said that union tradesmen were slated to get on a vessel as early as next week for monopile installation, which drives the foundations of wind turbines into the seabed.\n\n\u201cThat means that in two weeks, those workers won\u2019t have a paycheck coming their way,\u201d said Rosario.\n\nThe state\u2019s Climate Act established the target of a 70% renewably sourced grid by 2030.\n\nEarlier this year, Inside Climate News reported that this timeline is already likely to be delayed, and that the number of renewable projects planned for the New York downstate region is very small.\n\n\u201cWe need to redouble our efforts at the state level, especially downstate, in getting new generation projects off the ground,\u201d said Alexander Patterson, the campaign coordinator for Public Power NY, which has been fighting for a more expansive buildout of renewable energy. \u201cThis is just the latest in a long line of projects to be canceled, whether it\u2019s due to financial headwinds or inflation, and now political headwinds.\u201d\n\nThe halting of construction at Empire Wind 1 could lead to further delays for the state\u2019s energy transition. The Trump administration\u2019s stop-work order is also likely to sow uncertainty well beyond the downstate regions of New York.\n\n\u201cIf we now have a situation where every change in administration could mean the revoking of permits and stop-work orders, I think it breaks the certainty that we have moving forward,\u201d said Rob Freudenberg, the vice-president of energy and environment programs at the Regional Plan Association, a civic organization that looks at how to improve the quality of life in the tristate area. \u201cThat should reverberate beyond the offshore wind industry itself.\u201d"

                "article_summary": "The Ivanpah Solar Power Facility in California, once hailed as a leading solar energy project, is set to close in 2026 after failing to generate efficient energy, despite a $2.2 billion investment and government support. Its outdated technology has been outpaced by more efficient solar methods, leading to underperformance and significant wildlife deaths, with estimates of 6,000 bird fatalities annually. Critics argue that the project exemplifies the inefficiencies of government-subsidized energy initiatives, emphasizing the need for private investment in innovative technologies.",
                "source": "nypost",
                "text": "Seen from the sky, the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility in California\u2019s Mojave Desert resembles a futuristic dream.\n\nViewed from the bottom line, however, Ivanpah is anything but.\n\nThe solar power plant, which features three 459-foot towers and thousands of computer-controlled mirrors known as heliostats, cost some $2.2 billion to build.\n\nConstruction began in 2010 and was completed in 2014. Now, it\u2019s set to close in 2026 after failing to efficiently generate solar energy.\n\nIn 2011, the US Department of Energy under former President Barack Obama issued $1.6 billion in three federal loan guarantees for the project and the Secretary of Energy, Ernest Moniz, hailed it as \u201can example of how America is becoming a world leader in solar energy.\u201d\n\nBut ultimately, it\u2019s been more emblematic of profligate government spending and unwise bets on poorly conceived, quickly outdated technologies.\n\n\u201cIvanpah stands as a testament to the waste and inefficiency of government subsidized energy schemes,\u201dJason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, an American energy advocacy group, told Fox News via statement this past February. It \u201cnever lived up to its promises, producing less electricity than expected, while relying on natural gas to stay operational.\u201d\n\nWhen Ivanpah began operating in 2014, it ranked as the world\u2019s largest solar plant. It seemed like a viable solution to California\u2019s renewable energy goals of employing affordable and efficient technology to reduce the need for fossil fuels.\n\nLocated near the California-Nevada border, 65 miles southwest of Las Vegas, the plant\u2019s glowing towers are as striking as some casinos on the Strip.\n\nThe facility\u2019s five-square-miles of desert were covered with some 173,500 heliostats, adjusted via computer to catch maximum rays. The computer-controlled mirrors can reflect light from the sun at temperatures that can reach 1,000 degrees in part of the installment.\n\n\u201cThe idea was that you could use the sun to produce a heat source,\u201d alternative energy consultant Edward Smeloff told The Post. \u201cThe mirrors reflect heat from the sun up to a receiver, which is mounted on top of the tower. That heats a fluid. It creates steam [that spins] a conventional steam turbine. It is complicated.\u201d\n\nThough it sounds like a bit of a Rube Goldberg contraption \u2014 and looks like an art installation \u2014 Ivanpah was a cutting edge idea for a while. But, as the market changed, it couldn\u2019t compete with newer and less less expensive forms of creating solar power.\n\n\u201cIt simply did not scale up,\u201d said Smeloff. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an obsolete technology [that\u2019s] been outpaced by solar photovoltaic technology.\u201d\n\nThat tech uses semiconductor material to transform sunlight into energy in a streamlined process. The solar energy panels you see on many residential rooftops or lined up in endless rows across the desert rely on the technology.\n\nA statement from NRG Energy, the Texas based company that was an Ivanpah partner and the largest investor, having put up $300 million, agrees with Smeloff\u2019s view.\n\n\u201cWhen the power purchase agreements were signed in 2009, the prices were competitive, but advancements over time \u2026 have led to more efficient, cost effective and flexible options for producing reliable clean energy,\u201d a company statement read.\n\nIvanpah hasn\u2019t just been inefficient and expensive, it\u2019s also been deadly for wildlife.\n\nAccording to the Association of Avian Veterinarians, the power plant \u201cis believed to be responsible for at least 6,000 bird deaths each year.\u201d\n\nThey get fried \u201cif they fly in the area where the reflection is going up to the tower,\u201d Smeloff explained\n\nBut maybe it didn\u2019t have to be that way. A report published by World Economic Forum earlier this year noted that private investors can be more nimble with new technologies than the government.\n\n\u201cUnlike public market investors, private equity firms can implement transformative changes through hands-on management and aligned incentives,\u201d the report read.\n\nSteven Milloy, senior fellow at the Energy & Environmental Legal Institute and former Trump EPA transition team member, agrees.\n\n\u201cNo green project relying on taxpayer subsidies has ever made any economic or environmental sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that President Trump stop the taxpayer bleeding by ending what he accurately calls the Green New Scam.\u201d"

It also first reported the employees being placed on leave.\n\nAll the workers who were placed on indefinite leave were at the meetings, Dodson said. They were escorted out of their offices, and their laptops were taken. However, they were told the move was not a disciplinary action.\n\nThe union has not been given any information about the USDA\u2019s decision to place its members on leave, she said.\n\n\u201cThe general public deserves honesty and transparency in data and reports,\u201d Dodson said. \u201cRetaliating against workers who provide that data is not in the public\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nThe USDA said that the research service\u2019s employees are \u201ctrusted with confidential information.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn unauthorized disclosure of non-public information shows questionable judgment and any employee willing to break that public trust undermines the integrity of the agency,\u201d the USDA said in a statement.\n\nCanceling the report\n\nThe Trump administration said Saturday that it is terminating the food insecurity report because it had become \u201credundant, costly and politicized\u201d and noting that \u201cextraneous studies do nothing more than fear monger.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor 30 years, this study \u2014 initially created by the Clinton administration as a means to support the increase of SNAP eligibility and benefit allotment \u2014 failed to present anything more than subjective, liberal fodder,\u201d the US Department of Agriculture said in a statement Saturday, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the formal name for food stamps.\n\nThe USDA said Saturday that it still plans to issue one final report in October. That report will cover hunger in 2024, the last year of the Biden administration.\n\nThe decision comes as President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress passed a sweeping domestic agenda package earlier this year that will enact massive cuts to the food stamps program.\n\nSome 2.4 million fewer Americans, including families with children, are forecast to receive food stamps benefits in an average month after lawmakers expanded work requirements to some parents, older enrollees and others, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis released in August.\n\nAnd other recipients are expected to see their monthly assistance shrink \u2013 at a time when grocery prices remain high and food banks are trying to cope with increased demand.\n\nNearly 42 million people received food stamps, as of May, according to the USDA. The average monthly benefit was just over $188 per person.\n\nIn 2023, some 13.5% of households were food insecure at least at some point in the year, according to the most recent USDA report. That share was higher than it was in 2022, when it was 12.8%.\n\nAdvocates for low-income Americans have voiced concerns about the administration\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThis research is pivotal, and without it, we cannot evaluate whether policies are effective or responsive to community needs or document the impact of harmful policy decisions, such as the recent historic cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP),\u201d Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, said in a statement."

It\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019d be ready to play, once we bring him in, for Philadelphia right now anyway.\u201d\n\nA former lineman with the University of Florida, Watson was initially brought in by the Buccaneers after going undrafted in April.\n\nAt 6-foot-6 and 464 pounds on his school\u2019s pro day, he was on track to become the heaviest player in NFL history.

                "text": "Despite what you may have heard recently, and contrary to what US President Donald Trump apparently believes, there is autism in Cuba.\n\nFor years the island\u2019s state-run medical system has operated clinics to treat Cubans with autism and carried out campaigns to raise awareness of the neurological developmental disorder. Cuba even offers specialized autism therapies such as swimming with dolphins for foreigners seeking treatment who can pay in badly needed hard currency.\n\nBut even though information about how Cuba\u2019s healthcare system treats autism is available to anyone savvy enough to write \u201cCuba\u201d and \u201cautism\u201d into Google, Trump on Monday made the bizarre and false claim that the island\u2019s poverty has spared Cubans from the condition.\n\n\u201cI mean, there\u2019s a rumor, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s so or not, that Cuba, they don\u2019t have Tylenol because they don\u2019t have the money for Tylenol. And they have virtually no autism, OK. Tell me about that one,\u201d Trump said at an event on Monday where he urged pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol, which he claimed \u2013 despite a lack of scientific evidence \u2013 could cause autism in their unborn children.\n\nCuban officials have yet to respond to Trump\u2019s false claims and his comments have not been reported so far in the island\u2019s state-run press.\n\nBut for years Cuban doctors have publicly detailed efforts made to treat children on the island who suffer from autism.\n\n\u201cEvery autistic person is unique, and their well-being depends on listening, understanding, and walking alongside them, knowing that inclusion isn\u2019t measured in words, but in embraces that respect silence and celebrate different ways of existing,\u201d Dr. Osmara Delgado S\u00e1nchez told the state-run website Cubadebate on April 2, which is Autism Awareness Day.\n\nWhile Cuba has reported much lower instances of autism than many developed countries \u2013 0.36 cases per 10,000 people \u2013 the island\u2019s health professionals concede that may in part be the result of the lack of resources needed to more widely diagnose the condition.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, in 2021 about 1 in 127 people had autism. But the WHO cautioned, \u201cthe prevalence of autism in many low- and middle-income countries is unknown.\u201d\n\nDespite increasingly scant funds, Cuba\u2019s beleaguered health sector is making autism a priority, officials said.\n\nIn the same Cubadebate article, Delgado said that there are 300 Cuban health professionals specialized in autism working in seven centers across the island devoted to treating patients with autism.\n\nCuba, she said, has developed specific autism treatments since 2018.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about curing (Cuban patients with autism),\u201d Delgado told the site. \u201cBut maximizing abilities \u2026 so no one is left behind.\u201d"

                "text": "It\u2019s a new chapter for London Fashion Week. The first to take place under the British Fashion Council\u2019s new CEO Laura Weir, who has made her message clear: \u201cfashion matters.\u201d\n\nIn her opening speech on Friday, Weir doubled down on her ambition to make London \u201ca sensational showcase of creative fashion design talent\u201d by reducing the barriers to entry and opening the schedule to \u201cnew energy, new thinking and new ideas.\u201d That includes participation from new and returning brands, but also a wider breadth of international editors and buyers to platform the UK capital on the global stage. Backstage, designers both new and established were cautiously optimistic at the promises being made.\n\nAlready, there are signs that the city is being taken more seriously. Earlier in the week, members of Parliament gathered to discuss whether London Fashion Week was in the national interest \u2014 marking the first time the event had been debated at government level. \u201cWe know as an industry that there is often a lapse of respect for fashion and the contribution it brings to the UK,\u201d Weir said. \u201cThe world is watching this week. Let us show them what only London can do.\u201d\n\nIndeed, there were blockbuster moments from the likes of Burberry \u2014 who closed out the week\u2019s schedule with a star-studded show at Kensington Palace Gardens, attended by Elton John, Olivia Dean and Vanessa Williams \u2014 as well as H&M (the latter opened the week with a celebrity-filled catwalk walked by Romeo Beckham and with a performance from \u201cMessy\u201d singer Lola Young). But smaller designers also gave plenty to talk about \u2014 from noteworthy milestones, including the various anniversaries of Roksanda, Harris Reed, Ashish and Fashion East (the incubator that launched Jonathan Anderson\u2019s career), to the innovation from newcomers including Oscar Ouyang, Maximilian Raynor and Johanna Parv.\n\n\u201cIt really feels like there\u2019s a renewed sense of energy in London right now,\u201d said Daniel Fletcher, who designs for his namesake label as well as the Chinese brand Mithridate.\n\nBrits vs. Americans\n\nWhile members of the UK government were considering the country\u2019s relationship to fashion, a handful of designers were distilling their own experience of British life onto the runway. Patrick McDowell, a Liverpudlian designer based in London, staged his first catwalk since winning the prestigious Queen Elizabeth II Award for Design in May. Dedicated to his home county, the collection was titled \u201cLancashire Rose,\u201d and featured cinched blazers in jacquard fabric and sandy colored trench coats reimagined into strapless tops and full skirts. Fletcher, who presented his second collection for Mithridate, said he was inspired by two British archetypes: the country folk and the town dwellers. His fusion of these two \u201cvery different worlds\u201d manifested in pink sequined party dresses layered over Oxford shirts and tall riding boots paired with sparkly underwear. \u201cIt\u2019s a clash that shouldn\u2019t really work, but somehow does,\u201d he told CNN backstage.\n\nBut a few renegades creatively defected across the pond, looking instead at America for inspiration. The eponymous designer Yuhan Wang was inspired by David Lynch\u2019s \u201cMullholland Drive\u201d (2001), while the cult British-Bulgarian brand Chopova Lowena created an entire cheer squad with tinsel hair extensions and rhinestone eyeliner.\n\nInspired by the community and culture that comes with cheerleading, there were letterman jackets, T-shirts that read \u201cPopular\u201d in varsity typeface, and knitted hoodies emblazoned with pom-pom yielding models, who walked to the tune of AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck,\u201d which has become synonymous with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders following their hit Netflix show. \u201cIt was a lot of healing high school trauma in a way,\u201d co-founder Emma Chopova said after the show. \u201cIt reframed things that happened to us, who were, and who we wanted to be.\u201d\n\nStreetwear, but not as you know it\n\nStreetwear, a pillar of UK dressing for several decades, was made new again by a slew of designers redefining urban style. Yaku Stapleton, founder of YAKU, designed hoodies, capes and camouflage pants that looked like they were inspired by role-playing games (RPG). His models could have been downloaded from Zelda, with cargo pants that held axes and sword sheaths remade in fabric.\n\nLueder\u2019s take on modern medieval feudalism, with knitted hoods and 3D-printed horned clogs, was inspired by the historical summer camps designer Marie Lueder went to as a child, where she role-played periods in history (costumes and all) from 300 BC to the end of the 15th century. For his first ready-to-wear collection the mononymic designer HARRI, known for his circus-like inflatable pieces, stuck with his signature fabric of latex. This time, however, there were bomber jackets, mesh shirts and Bermuda shorts \u2014 the kind of everyday clothing you\u2019d see on the street, though some items, such as a cap and body vest, were aerated for old times\u2019 sake.\n\nElsewhere, Johanna Parv continued to design for \u201cthe woman who is living in the city right now,\u201d she told CNN, particularly \u201cbrave\u201d cyclists, with nylon dresses, skirts and rain jackets that can be adjusted for whether one is commuting, working, partying or exercising.\n\nHips don\u2019t lie\n\nRoyalty may be on the mind of many, following the new exhibition on Marie Antoinette\u2019s style in London, which has many of the French queen\u2019s extravagant gowns on show. Panniers \u2014 undergarments that sit on the hips to expand the silhouette outwards \u2014 have also been seen on recent red carpets. At the Venice Film Festival earlier this summer, Italian actor Alba Rohrwacher turned heads when she stepped out in a Dior haute couture gown complete with a protruding bustle.\n\nNo surprise, then, that voluminous hips were a seasonal feature on the runway. See the Chinese-Irish designer Simone Rocha whose dresses and skirts had wired crinolines on show, rather than hidden underneath. Backstage, Rocha shared her inspiration \u2014 a \u201cdisgruntled debutante\u201d \u2014 and the desire to push herself by working with tried-and-tested materials albeit in new ways. She also nodded to her heritage with pops of red, an auspicious color in Chinese culture.\n\nAt Dilara Findikoglu, models looked like ladies in waiting that had risen from the dead; wearing antiquated corsetry that was dirtied and torn. Sharp hip bones jutted out above low-slung lace-up leather pants, at times accentuated further by draped body chains. Others were padded in ruffles and lace. The collection was titled \u201cCage of Innocence,\u201d in a nod to the silenced women of history. Findikogulu\u2019s uncompromising and subversive vision, along with her meticulous understanding of the female body, has made her one of London Fashion Week\u2019s hottest tickets.\n\nWeaving a new thread\n\nOne notable feature of London designers is their desire to experiment and seek alternatives to the status quo.\n\nBackstage, Oscar Ouyang said the word that summarized his debut show was \u201creinvention\u201d. He experimented with bird feathers, seen on the collar of a shortened car coat and a pair of shorts. Fresh-faced models wore sprigs of down in their hair, like the lost boys in \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d The Beijing-born designer, who studied a MA course in knitwear at Central Saint Martins, didn\u2019t stop there: He used a combination of machine and hand-knit techniques to create cartoon-sh proportioned T-shirts and braided bags and tunics out of straw.\n\nPauline Dujancourt, a womenswear designer also specializing in knitwear, was also inspired by the symbolism of birds. Dujancourt\u2019s hauntingly beautiful gowns were a mixture of chunky Argyle knit, delicate lace and frothy tulle ruffle \u2014 but the sum was greater than its parts. \u201cI discovered all those techniques from my grandmother,\u201d Dujancourt told CNN after the show. She also emphasized the importance of craft, and modernizing the artform for new generations. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to go back to that but offer a new rationale so people will actually want to knit and want to wear knitwear.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, rising designers Paolo Carzana and Susan Fang continued to challenge material boundaries, resulting in garments that are thoughtfully designed, adaptable and aesthetically unique. Carzana\u2019s selling point is using repurposed materials and vegetable dyes, which encourages a more considered approach to clothes (not to mention, unexpected color pairings like violet with burnt orange). They popped against the backdrop of books in the British Library, where the show was held. Fang, meanwhile, took to the leafy conservatory of the Barbican, where she showed dresses made using beads and 3D-printed patchwork that looked like flower petals as the models \u2014 including Korean it-girl Irene Kim \u2014 walked.\n\nWith contributions from CNN\u2019s Kati Chitrakorn."

This trend reflects a broader movement among brides to embrace individuality and reject conventional norms in wedding attire.",

                "text": "Weddings tend to be formulaic. Vows. Champagne. Dancing. But, recently, one crucial element is becoming harder to predict: the dress. Instead of choosing traditional white, many brides are opting for something with a bit more of an impact. The anti-trad bridal dress is on the rise. Searches on Pinterest are up 240% for \u201cunique wedding dresses\u201d, while blush pink wedding dresses are up 60% and black 50%.\n\nOn Wednesday, the fashion designer Ashish Gupta, whose dazzling sequined pieces are loved by fans including Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna, launched his first bridal range. Instead of trad white gowns, you\u2019ll find a sheer trapeze-shaped dress adorned with delicate hand-embroidered organza flowers in yellow and lilac that look as if they have been plucked from Martha Stewart\u2019s cutting garden, and a halterneck mini-dress smothered in multicoloured glass bead fringing, inspired by Holi, the Hindu festival of colour. Even the customary veil has been reimagined. Ashish\u2019s \u201cconfetti\u201d version features shimmering, multicoloured sequins and beads.\n\nGupta describes his typical bridal customer as non-traditional: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care much for rules and possibly has no idea what \u2018something blue\u2019 is supposed to be. She\u2019s fun, a bit irreverent, and loves colour and sparkle. It\u2019s less fairytale, but more magic.\u201d\n\nThe wedding dress retailer David\u2019s Bridal has also got the colour memo. This week, it launched a collaboration with Marchesa, the New York womenswear brand co-founded by Georgina Chapman. The designer has been working to reposition her brand as a red carpet staple, following her divorce from the disgraced Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein. Featuring more than 40 dresses, the collaboration\u2019s colour chart spans everything from zesty limes and hot crimsons to grey and charcoal. A style of tulle gown embellished with black petal embroidery that Chapman wore to accompany her boyfriend, the actor Adrien Brody, to this year\u2019s Golden Globes will also be available to buy for brides to be.\n\nDavid\u2019s Bridal CEO, Kelly Cook, speaking to the Wall Street Journal, said the collection was inspired by brides increasingly searching for unique dresses. \u201cThey\u2019re wearing cowboy boots with couture.\u201d\n\nKate Halfpenny, whose Halfpenny London bridalwear brand is celebrating 20 years, has also seen a shift towards more distinctive styles. Among her made-to-order customers, blush has become a favourite while she has also dressed several brides in black-and-white separates.\n\nWhen Harriet Hall, features director of Cosmopolitan UK, got married in 2020, she did so in a hot pink tulle dress by the British designer Molly Goddard. Five years later and she has no regrets describing it as her \u201cfavourite dress in the world.\u201d Hall says she chose the \u201celectric pink Brillo pad\u201d style as she wanted something fun. But it was also a push back against patriarchal traditions.\n\nWriting in British Vogue, Hall described it as not a wedding gown but a showstopper. \u201cIt was a dress so in-your-face that it rejected any suggestion of the virginal purity, wifely subservience or impassivity that white dresses can come to symbolise. Yes, it was pink, but I\u2019m not talking blush, peach, candy, nor the problematic \u2018nude\u2019. No, this was a hue so electric the frock appeared to emit its own glow, a colour Elsa Schiaparelli referred to in the 1940s as \u2018shocking pink\u2019; so loud it was subversive.\u201d\n\nGoddard\u2019s most recent collection featured a range of colourful millefeuille-esque dresses spanning everything from azure blue to apricot. While not being bridal specific, they would work for any bride with a similar brief.\n\nAs refreshing as it is to see brides ripping up the rulebook, perhaps the anti-trad dress isn\u2019t that modern after all. As TikTok\u2019s literary fans recently pointed out, a photo showing Margot Robbie on the set of Emerald Fennell\u2019s forthcoming film Wuthering Heights in a white wedding dress is historically incorrect. The book is set in the Georgian era, a time where red, pink, blue and black wedding dresses were standard. It was only in 1840 when Queen Victoria married Prince Albert that white wedding gowns became the norm.\n\nElizabeth Taylor wore a canary yellow dress for her nuptials in 1964. Sarah Jessica Parker got married in a black dress in 1997, as did Chlo\u00eb Sevigny in 2020. In India and China, it\u2019s red that is the tradition. Gupta says that even a white dress doesn\u2019t have \u201cto take itself so seriously\u201d, pointing to a mini slip dress enveloped in sequins. \u201cI don\u2019t think one has to follow the rulebook any more,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s more important to be fabulous and have fun on your big day.\u201d"

                "text": "We\u2019re approaching what appears to be an appropriately dumb ending to an inordinately dumb fight over TikTok.\n\nDumb is a harsh word, and I mean it deeply. The dumbest part: The Trump administration\u2019s brokered solution to keep the app in the United States risks turning it into yet another once-great social media platform.\n\nHere\u2019s the latest, as of Monday:\n\nIn sum: Chances for potential Chinese manipulation of US data would be much lower. Chances for yet another right-wing takeover of a super popular social media app just went up exponentially.\n\nThere is still a lot we don\u2019t know, including:\n\n\u2014 What other investors are involved and how much are they shelling out?\n\n\u2014 Will users have to download a new app?\n\nThe answers to those questions will be crucial if the American-owned TikTok is going to, like, work.\n\n\u201cFor now, the deal is vaporware,\u201d Alex Falcone, a comedian with more than 626,000 followers on TikTok, told me. \u201cBut obviously it doesn\u2019t sound promising \u2026 TikTok is a finely balanced ecosystem, so if they come galumphing into it, they\u2019ll kill all life in it overnight.\u201d\n\nTikTok\u2019s new owners need to retain its 170 million scroll-happy users in the US if they intend to make money on it. And the investors named so far have mixed experience in social media. Oracle isn\u2019t a consumer-facing tech company, though it has a longstanding relationship with TikTok, hosting its data. Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. primarily owns legacy TV and and newspaper properties \u2014 it bought the early social media site MySpace in 2005, only to sell it at a loss in 2011. Silver Lake was an early Twitter investor, and Andreesen Horowitz invested in Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest, among others.\n\nA shift in ownership has certainly hurt some platforms in the past. When Elon Musk bought Twitter, he gutted the place, tore down the guardrails and welcomed neo-Nazi trolls to the platform, prompting users and advertisers to flee.\n\n\u201cWhile still speculative, we could see similar dynamics play out again,\u201d Emarketer principal analyst Jasmine Enberg noted in an email Monday.\n\nTo be sure, Musk spent mostly his own money on Twitter and wasn\u2019t accountable to shareholders, so it didn\u2019t matter if he was lighting the money on fire. The TikTok deal would have to contend with the investors\u2019 corporate board members, who have a fiduciary duty to ensure no one can take a pricey asset like TikTok and turn it into some kind of right-wing megaphone.\n\nBut TikTok is yet another massive audience that is about to spin closer to the MAGA-aligned media orbit. The Trump administration \u2014 which in just the past year has sued ABC, CBS, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal \u2014 and its corporate cheerleaders aren\u2019t exactly hiding their desire to control mass media. (Just ask Jimmy Kimmel.)\n\nAlthough Trump credits TikTok for a surge in Republican youth votes in 2024, TikTok\u2019s users are mostly young and left-leaning. If a right-wing takeover of TikTok takes place, we could be in for a repeat of the Twitter saga, and a large number of TikTok users would likely rush the exits.\n\nContent creators who rely on income from the app have had more than a year to prepare for its end, and many have been building up their follower bases on rival platforms like Reels, YouTube and even other Chinese-owned apps like Rednote \u2014 all of which saw traffic surge when TikTok briefly went offline earlier this year.\n\nTikTok won\u2019t be allowed to die if its core user base moves on. It\u2019ll become a refuge for anyone, or any bot, to gin up the kind of engagement-bait and AI slop that now dominates Facebook and X."

                "article_summary": "A growing number of evangelical Christians are using TikTok to prepare for an anticipated rapture, with some selling their belongings and sharing advice for those left behind. This phenomenon, sparked by South African preacher Joshua Mhlakela, reflects a historical pattern of apocalyptic predictions that often resurface during times of societal turmoil. While many posts mix humor with serious beliefs, experts note that such rapture theories thrive on feelings of fear and uncertainty in the world.",
                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "If you believe a vocal cohort of evangelical Christians on social media, consider Tuesday 23 September \u2013 or maybe Wednesday 24 September \u2013 a wrap on this whole society thing. For the first time, the rapture is playing out on TikTok.\n\nBelievers have taken to the app to disclose their preparation for impending doom, claiming to have sold their cars or requested \u201ceternity leave\u201d from their employers, and fretting over whether the family dog gets to come to heaven too. One woman advised her followers to do away with their phones\u2019 password protections, so that any loved ones that get left behind can easily access their personal information. Another bought Bibles in bulk at Dollar Tree, which she planned to leave behind with personalized notes in hopes of saving some last-minute converts.\n\nEvangelical Christians who believe in the rapture describe it as a fundamental doctrine: the idea that one day, true believers of God will ascend into heaven, ending life as we know it \u2013 while the rest are left behind for a seven-year period of suffering at the hands of the antichrist.\n\nSince the theory was popularized in the early 1800s by a British clergyman named John Nelson Darby, there have been countless false alarms: in 1844, a New York farmer turned Baptist preacher named William Miller amassed thousands of followers through preaching a second coming that never materialized, in an event later dubbed the Great Disappointment. When Halley\u2019s comet passed through the sky in 1910, scammers sold \u201canti-comet pills\u201d intended to save souls. In 1997, the Hale-Bopp comet led 39 members of the Heaven\u2019s Gate cult to die by mass suicide.\n\nThis time around, the call came from the South African preacher Joshua Mhlakela, who spread the word during a June podcast appearance. \u201cThe rapture is upon us, whether you are ready or not,\u201d Mhlakela said. The theory quickly translated to TikTok, where the hashtag #rapture has more than 320,000 posts.\n\nTyler Huckabee is the managing editor at Sojo.net, a progressive Christian publication, where he says the newsroom\u2019s \u201cjoke of the day\u201d is that deadlines have ceased to matter. \u201cThis is by no means my first rodeo in terms of a certain sect of Christian theology that starts the rumor about the end of the world, and that catching fire,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cFacebook definitely had it, Twitter had it, but it\u2019s TikTok\u2019s first end of the world moment.\u201d\n\nRapture reports thrive during times of tumult, said Matthew Gabriele, a professor in the department of religion and culture at Virginia Tech who studies apocalyptic movements. \u201cIf you\u2019re a believing Christian, you don\u2019t know when this is going to happen per se, but you look for the signs,\u201d Gabriele explained. \u201cUsually when things are getting \u2018really bad\u2019, that\u2019s when the elect will be saved. So it\u2019s not a surprise that [people are predicting the rapture] in this particular moment, where there\u2019s political violence, economic concerns, disease, etc \u2013 these are very common tropes within apocalyptic texts.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the phrase \u201cend times\u201d is often thrown around on social media to describe our fractured, collapsing reality of plague-like pandemic, biblical-level natural disasters and mass violence. In the last week, believers have linked Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination to the rapture theory: some on TikTok have suggested that Kirk, who in death became a martyr for Christian nationalists and whose memorial service veered into religious revival territory, could be resurrected during the rapture.\n\nJess Lauren, a 27-year-old content creator who also runs a clothing startup, grew up \u201cheavily involved\u201d in the Christian church. Both of her parents were pastors. While attending the University of California, Davis, Lauren began to question her conservative, religious beliefs, joining the \u201cdeconstructing\u201d movement \u2013 where former believers reconsider the dogma they accepted as children.\n\nAs a kid, she believed in the rapture, especially after reading Left Behind, a blockbuster apocalyptic book series co-written by Tim LaHaye, a homophobic minister who believed in the Illuminati, and the Christian writer Jerry B Jenkins. (It was later adapted to film multiple times, including a 2014 version starring Nicolas Cage.) Lauren grew up as the youngest of four kids, meaning she rarely came home to an empty house. If she ever did, Lauren would head out on to the street to look for rapture survivors. \u201cI\u2019d be like, \u2018OK, are there less people driving today? Have I been left behind?\u201d she said.\n\nDitto for April Ajoy, a podcaster and author of the memoir Star-Spangled Jesus: Leaving Christian Nationalism and Finding a True Faith. \u201cWhen I was 13, I legitimately thought I\u2019d been left behind because I was chatting on AOL instant messenger on our family computer, and the house got really quiet all of a sudden,\u201d she said. \u201cI started looking for my family, and I couldn\u2019t find them anywhere. For about 20 minutes, I literally started prepping. I thought I was going to need to go to the military supply store, get food and go underground.\n\nThen my family came back \u2013 they\u2019d just gone on a walk. That\u2019s really traumatizing.\u201d\n\nAjoy would pray \u201cthat God would hold off\u201d the rapture until she got older, so she could experience graduating high school, getting married and having sex for the first time. At the same time, she was excited for it. \u201cWe\u2019re taught that it\u2019s a get out of death free card,\u201d said Ajoy. \u201cYou go straight to heaven, you don\u2019t have to die, and you don\u2019t live through the terrible things that happen on earth.\u201d\n\nRapture rumors typically amp up in September, Ajoy says, due to the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah, which is mentioned in the Bible. \u201cBut ultimately, I think any time people feel really out of control and scared, it\u2019s prime time for them to start talking about the rapture,\u201d she said.\n\nOn TikTok, the fear is not always so palpable. Many #RaptureTok posts fall into the breezy genre of quippy, conversational content that does well in the algorithm. Sara Reinis, a doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania who studies religion and social media, has seen videos of moms sharing their end times prepping routines or giving tips for people who are left behind.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re adopting the language of self-help, which is so prevalent on social media, and attaching it to the rapture discussion,\u201d she said. \u201cSome don\u2019t really know if this is when the rapture is going to happen, but they think it\u2019s still an important wake-up call to pay attention to. They\u2019re hedging their bets.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just believers who have pulled up a chair to #RaptureTok. Outside religious circles, social media users are encouraging anyone who is giving away material goods in preparation to throw some cash their way. In one parody video, a woman gives tips to people who are left behind, such as: \u201cStockpile VHS copies of Shrek. It\u2019s now the new currency.\u201d One X user pointed out that 23 September is also Bisexual Visibility Day, meaning that if a \u201csecond coming\u201d did happen, it would also be Jesus\u2019s \u201ccoming out day\u201d.\n\nSo what will have changed if we wake up on Thursday? Huckabee, the Sojo.net editor, says that if past false flag raptures are any indicator, not much. People who go all-in on the rapture only to be proved wrong do not usually use it as an opportunity to reflect on their beliefs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very human fear of saying \u2018I was wrong,\u2019\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cSo what I\u2019ve tended to see from the people who quit their job because they think Jesus is coming back, or whatever, it\u2019s that they say they got something wrong \u2013 maybe the date was a bit off, but it\u2019s still coming soon. There\u2019s always a way to kick the ball down the road.\u201d"

I bet you mine\u2019s worse.\u201d She explained that her left eyelid has been stuck shut for days \u2014 and could stay like that for up to three months, according to her doctor.\n\n\u201cCatch me winking at you for the next 12 weeks,\u201d August quipped. The video has been shared widely, with many viewers offering advice and sympathy.\n\nViewers responded with shock \u2014 and mockery. \u201cJust assert dominance and rock an eye patch,\u201d one suggested.\n\nTo which August responded, \u201cGonna have to be a pirate for Halloween.\u201d\n\nAugust\u2019s Botox treatment was meant to ease her chronic migraines, a common use for Botox, but something went wrong. While she didn\u2019t go into specific details about the procedure, she explained in follow-up posts that her regular neurologist administered the injections.\n\nViewers quickly jumped into the comments with theories, suggesting the injector might have hit the muscle responsible for her eyelid, temporarily paralyzing it.\n\nWhile the exact cause remains unclear, August\u2019s frustration is evident.\n\nThe condition August is experiencing, known as ptosis \u2014 drooping eyelid \u2014 is a known but rare side effect of Botox injections for migraines. It occurs when the Botox weakens the muscles that lift the eyelid, causing it to partially or completely close.\n\nPtosis is usually temporary, typically resolving within two to six weeks as the Botox wears off.\n\nDoctors often recommend eye drops to tighten the affected muscle and lift the eyelid. Some specialists even suggest gently massaging the eyelid, though this should only be done under professional supervision.\n\nBotox injections for migraines are typically administered around the forehead, temples, and back of the head. However, if the injection accidentally spreads to the wrong muscle or is misplaced, it can weaken muscles near the eye, leading to a drooping eyelid.\n\nWhile most cases of ptosis are mild, it\u2019s still important to consult with a doctor if you notice any drooping.\n\nViewers were quick to offer suggestions after watching August\u2019s viral video. Some shared advice on how to speed up the Botox\u2019s effects, like doing cardio to make it wear off faster. \u201cDo TONS of cardio, it makes Botox last way less,\u201d one commenter wrote.\n\nAnother advised, \u201cPut castor oil on it! I unknowingly used castor oil on my face after Botox, and it dissolved the Botox in like three weeks. Bye-bye $500, but it would be great for you!\u201d\n\nOthers offered their own experiences with Botox gone wrong. \u201cI had a half drop and used a Nuface microcurrent device a few times a day. It helped wear off the Botox more quickly,\u201d said one user.\n\nHowever, The Post is still waiting to confirm whether any of these fixes are recommended by medical professionals.\n\nWhile ptosis is only temporary, botched Botox procedures have caused serious consequences for some."

Automakers are likely to respond by adjusting sticker prices and offering incentives to maintain sales, though the overall impact of the tax credit's loss is uncertain. Despite the credit's expiration, a significant portion of potential buyers still plans to purchase EVs, citing factors like performance and environmental concerns as more important than the tax incentive.",
                "source": "cnn",
                "text": "Sales of electric vehicles in the United States are almost certain to tumble when the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers expires on October 1, leaving automakers and car buyers wondering where prices will go.\n\nThe tax credit, which was passed in 2022 as part of the Biden administration\u2019s legislative push to support EVs and green energy, is going away as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s broad spending and tax bill that passed in July. The move came after US EV sales in 2024 rose 7% to 1.6 million, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).\n\nThe end of the tax credit means demand for EVs is expected to fall, which means prices in real terms will rise \u2014 a concept not lost on the many consumers who rushed to buy EVs in August and September. But that surge is likely to result in plunging sales in the final three months of the year and could lead to somewhat lower EV prices ahead.\n\nWith fewer people buying EVs in the coming months, automakers are weighing where to set sticker prices and incentive levels to maintain some baseline of demand. But it\u2019s not clear how much savings that will provide buyers, and it likely won\u2019t make up for the money lost from the end of the tax credit.\n\nAutomakers either didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on their pricing plans or said they would monitor market conditions.\n\nBut history can be a guide. In 2019, when a previous version of the EV tax credit was phased out for Tesla and General Motors because both hit a prescribed sales target, those two automakers responded by cutting prices.\n\nEV sales have been growing steadily for years, and at a much faster pace than traditional gas-powered cars. US electric vehicles rose more than three times as fast as the 2% rise in non-electric passenger vehicles, according to data from the BTS.\n\nBut sales of EVs in the United States began to slow earlier this year, rising only 1.5% over the first six months of the year and actually falling 6.3% in the second quarter compared to a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive. That had prompted automakers to offer attractive deals, especially over lease terms.\n\nWith the tax credit loss, even more attractive offers are likely on the way, predicted Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds.\n\n\u201cIf you already can\u2019t sell the vehicles at current prices, there\u2019s no way you are going to sell them at today\u2019s prices with this credit going by the wayside,\u201d he said.\n\nAutomakers are also likely to respond to a drop in demand by cutting production of EVs. That could mean limited availability of some vehicles on dealer lots, and therefore less pressure to lower prices, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.\n\nDrury believes the price relief will either come through a lower sticker price, or better financing terms or cash-back offers for buyers.\n\nBut she also said automakers will face pressure to cut their prices to maintain some basic level of sales of their EV models.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll see some of that (price cuts and incentives) to keep the buying going,\u201d Valdez Streaty said, adding that the loss of the tax credit won\u2019t kill all demand.\n\nCox found that 65% of car buyers intending to purchase an EV in the next two years said they\u2019ll go ahead with those plans, even without the tax credit. Only 20% said they would purchase a hybrid or traditional gas-powered car instead.\n\nThe same survey from Cox found that vehicle performance, fuel and maintenance savings, as well as concerns about the environment, were all more important factors than the tax credit itself.\n\nAnd the EV tax credit doesn\u2019t apply to all models. It\u2019s not eligible for vehicles with a manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price (MSRP) of greater than $80,000, so the expiration won\u2019t necessarily affect the demand of many of the larger trucks or luxury models.\n\nAlso, unless Americans buy a vehicle from Tesla, which sells directly to consumers, most buyers will go through a dealership. Dealerships negotiate the transaction price with a buyer, which means what EV buyers will eventually pay will be something of a \u201cmoving target,\u201d said David Green, industry analyst for Cars.com.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be a little bit of turmoil in the market for quite some time,\u201d Green said."

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.\n\nAlexander the Great tried to conquer Termessos but failed. Today, the incredible deserted ruins of this once-powerful city, perched like a fortified eagle\u2019s nest high in the mountains of southwestern Turkey, can be conquered by anyone willing to make the hike up here.\n\nBut few people ever do.\n\nTermessos stands empty. A spectacular archeological jewel, preserved in isolation, seen only by a few handfuls of people who make the trip from the beach resorts of nearby tourism hot spot Antalya.\n\nThat\u2019s a shame for those who miss out. For those who do get to explore, it\u2019s a major bonus. They get to wander around one of Turkey\u2019s most impressive ancient cities all by themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s a place of incredible atmosphere: history and landscape; views and silence; nature and destruction \u2014 all combining to create one of the Mediterranean\u2019s great unsung archaeological wonders.\n\nHere, slowly being swallowed by vegetation and worn down by time, are gigantic mausoleums, vast underground cisterns, temples, imposing city walls and a breathtaking theater perched, like Machu Picchu, on a hilltop that offers views stretching for miles all around.\n\nDespite its emptiness, Termessos is easy to reach. It only takes around 45 minutes to drive from Antalya\u2019s traffic-snarled downtown to the gates of Mount G\u00fcll\u00fck-Termessos National Park \u2014 a protected wildlife haven that surrounds the ruins.\n\nAfter paying a three-euro (about $3) gate fee at the park\u2019s entrance, visitors then face another 10-minute ride further into the pine and gorse-clad hills along a switchback road that reaches about 1,000 meters above sea level.\n\nEventually the road emerges into what seems like an uninteresting parking lot with a public restroom. This was, in fact, at one time a giant agora, or marketplace for the city, which in its heyday 2,000 years ago would\u2019ve been bustling with traders and citizens.\n\nIt\u2019s here where the Termessos adventure begins.\n\nAnd it begins with death.\n\nTomb raiders\n\nHidden by vegetation at one end of the agora are the stone-strewn remains of what was clearly once a grand street leading away along the hillside. Instead of houses or shops, this was lined with the tombs of Termessos\u2019 rich and mighty.\n\nAncient sarcophagi carved with clues to who they once contained, like shields and spears for warriors, lie scattered. Some are small, others huge \u2014 offering clues to levels of wealth or power. Some are unfinished, their massive pedestals hinting at what would\u2019ve been.\n\nAll of them have been broken into by raiders over the centuries, their walls smashed or lids prised off despite once being locked shut with metal clasps. Tree roots and ivy creepers have also snaked through the stonework.\n\n\u201cThe thieves working here were very good at their jobs,\u201d says \u00d6nder U\u011fuz, an Antalya-based art teacher and licensed guide who offers tours of Termessos, which he\u2019s been captivated by since first coming here as a student in 1996 (\u201cIt was love at first sight!\u201d).\n\nReaching the heart of the ancient city involves an uphill hike along a leafy pathway that\u2019s a little rough and steep in places. Visitors here need to be equipped with sturdy footwear and OK with mildly strenuous hiking on tricky terrain. In summer, it\u2019s best to visit early before temperatures start to climb, and bring water.\n\nSoon the lower city walls loom into view \u2014 a first hint at how well-defended Termessos was when it was built perhaps around the fourth or fifth century BCE, long before the Romans showed up with the engineering skills that would transform the known world.\n\nWhich raises the question: how did the people of Termessos do it?\n\nU\u011fuz laughs off the suggestion of any mystery here. We\u2019re too caught up in the achievements of our technological age to appreciate even the basic abilities of our distant ancestors, in his opinion.\n\n\u201cYou and I, we\u2019re nothing without our computers and social media accounts,\u201d he says (shortly after taking a snap for his own Instagram feed). \u201cTake those away and we are helpless. Not these people. They worked with stone for centuries. They had nothing else. Building things like this was what they knew how to do.\u201d\n\nThe people of Termessos were known as Solyms, descendants of Luwians, an ancient civilization that was spread across what is now Turkey, but largely overlooked by archaeological scholars until the past few decades. To this day, little is known about the Solyms or when they constructed their city, although with the site\u2019s first-ever excavation announced in 2025, that could be set to change.\n\nThe Solyms, however, clearly knew what they were doing. Their choice of location showed a genius for strategic thinking. Not only was it on a major trade route, enabling it to grow wealthy on goods and payments from people heading to and from the Mediterranean, its altitude and commanding views made it easy to defend.\n\nWhich is why when Alexander the Great showed up around 333 BCE \u2014 when Termessos made its first real appearance in the history books \u2014 he was apparently unable to invade or blockade the city into surrender, despite multiple attempts. He reputedly called the city an \u201ceagle\u2019s nest.\u201d\n\nLater, the Romans had more success in controlling the city. Not through force, says U\u011fuz, but through more insidious means, like offering autonomy under Roman \u201cprotection.\u201d \u201cThe Romans were like the mafia,\u201d he suggests.\n\nFight school\n\nClimbing higher up the hillside on a rocky path sprouting with fragrant wild sage, there\u2019s more evidence of how sophisticated life in Termessos would\u2019ve been. To the left, there\u2019s the marble ruins of the city\u2019s gymnasium, a kind of college campus for trainee soldiers, complete with bathhouse and refectory.\n\nSome of the main building is still intact, with indications that impressive arches once ran across its front wall. Inside were two floors, plus a subterranean vault for storage. In front is the palaestra, an area that would\u2019ve been used for wrestling and combat training and which today is littered with pieces of the gymnasium\u2019s terracotta roof tiles.\n\nIt is, of course, mostly derelict. Termessos was believed to have been destroyed by an earthquake the exact date of which is not known, but possibly the 4th or 5th century. What remains is not the work of archeological reconstruction. It\u2019s the genuine state the building has been left in for the past 1,600 years.\n\nHere, on our visit in in June 2024, the silence and emptiness of the place allow the imagination to wander \u2014 bringing those warriors back to life and allowing visualization of their mock battles in a place that has changed so little over time.\n\nThe excavation work begun in the summer of 2025 will focus on the mausoleum, the necropolis road, ancient water structures and the Hadrian Gate, reports H\u00fcrriyet Daily News.\n\n\u201cOne main necropolis road stretches 400\u2013500 meters, lined with tombs and sarcophagi, many toppled. We\u2019ll restore podiums and reassemble them. Two waterworks structures will also undergo cleaning and repair,\u201d the leader of the excavation, Mustafa Ko\u00e7ak of Antalya Bilim University, told the Turkish newspaper.\n\nFurther up, the upper city walls give commanding views of the forest below and offer a good vantage point over anyone trying to sneak up for an invasion. Beyond them is more evidence of civilization.\n\nThere are the remains of a covered water drainage system. And for a city that had few water sources, they are one of its most impressive assets \u2014 gigantic multi-chambered underground cisterns carved by hand into solid rock and lined with plaster.\n\nCapable of holding up to 1,500 tons of water, these cavernous containers would\u2019ve been vital to the survival of a city that had few natural sources of H2O \u2014 especially when Alexander the Great was mounting blockades. Today, they\u2019re filled with broken columns and other rubble, likely dumped there when the city was abandoned. There\u2019s speculation water shortages could\u2019ve been behind a decision to finally relocate the city elsewhere.\n\nLuxury shops\n\nNearby, there\u2019s the imposing outer wall of the bouleuterion or assembly house that would\u2019ve been the city\u2019s seat of power, another central agora dating back to pre-Roman times and the ruins of a colonnaded street that once housed the city\u2019s most exclusive shops.\n\n\u201cThis is the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es of Termessos,\u201d says U\u011fuz. Like the Parisian upscale retail boulevard, this would\u2019ve been where the wealthy spent their cash, he explains. The finest olive oils, cloths, leather goods and items imported from all around the Mediterranean would\u2019ve been on sale here.\n\nThese are all sideshows to the city\u2019s showstopper attraction: the theater.\n\nAfter a last scramble over huge slabs of marble, the view opens up onto an epic panorama of the large performance space, perched on the city\u2019s highest point.\n\nThe setting is breathtaking, with mountain ravines cascading away on either side. The sheer drop behind the theater\u2019s upper walls is dizzying. It\u2019s a reminder to be careful when exploring ruins that haven\u2019t been fenced off for safety.\n\nWith room for about 4,000 people, the semi-circle of stone terraces faces the ruins of what would\u2019ve been a stage. The theater probably predated the arrival of the Romans, but was later updated along Roman lines.\n\nIn Termessos, the location is particularly significant, as it sits opposite a mountain that was once sacred to the city\u2019s inhabitants. It\u2019s easy to see why this was such a hallowed spot, with views that, on haze-free days, stretch as far as the port of Antalya.\n\nAnd again, it\u2019s a place to sit and imagine what life was like nearly 2,000 years ago, when such theaters would\u2019ve been used by the Romans as, according to U\u011fuz, a propaganda tool \u2014 a soft force to keep their empire in check.\n\nAs history lessons go, this is pretty spectacular.\n\nU\u011fuz (who can be contacted via email: onder.uguz@gmail.com) says he never tires of exploring Termessos. He also offers tours of other more popular archaeological sites in the area, but the tranquility and beauty of this hidden ancient wonder draw him back time and again. He particularly loves soaking in the vistas from the city\u2019s upper walls.\n\n\u201cUsually, I\u2019m sitting there with my wife, under a juniper tree in springtime, a beautiful blue sky with this great scenery,\u201d he says, adding that year-round, the solitude offered by Termessos is also an attraction.\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s perfect. Just you and nature; little squirrels and archaeology. The only thing missing is a cold beer.\u201d"

                "text": "In response to the stabbing death of a Ukrainian refugee on Charlotte\u2019s light rail system, the North Carolina legislature gave final approval Tuesday to a criminal justice package that limits bail and seeks to ensure more defendants undergo mental health evaluations.\n\nThe Republican-penned bill also could help restart executions in the state.\n\nThe House voted 82-30 to accept the omnibus measure passed by the Senate on Monday, sending it next to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. Stein, a former attorney general, has said he supports some pretrial reforms following the fatal August 22 attack on 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether Stein would sign the bill into law or veto it. A Stein spokesperson said he was reviewing the measure.\n\nThe attack suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., had been arrested more than a dozen times and was released earlier this year by a magistrate on a misdemeanor count without any bond. Brown is charged with first-degree murder in state court and a federal count in connection with Zarutska\u2019s death. Both crimes can be punishable by the death penalty.\n\nBrown \u201cshould have never been allowed out of the jail. The catch-and-release practices for violent offenders will end today with your support,\u201d Charlotte-area Republican state Rep. Tricia Cotham told colleagues during two hours of House debate. \u201cThis heinous act was preventable.\u201d\n\nPublic outrage over Zarutska\u2019s death intensified with the release of security video showing the attack on the commuter train, leading President Donald Trump and GOP allies to accuse Charlotte and statewide elected Democrats of promoting soft-on-crime policies.\n\n\u2018Iryna\u2019s Law\u2019 addresses bail, magistrates, behavioral health\n\nMuch of the bill titled \u201cIryna\u2019s Law\u201d focuses on eliminating cashless bail for many crimes, limiting the discretion that magistrates and judges have in making pretrial release decisions, and laying out when offenders should be examined for possible involuntary commitment.\n\nBrown\u2019s mother told media outlets that her son has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.\n\nSeveral House Democrats took issue with the soft-on-crime label, pointing out that Republicans have controlled the General Assembly for over a decade. They said the bill falls well short in providing mental health services that advocates say could stop crimes before they occur, as well as funds to hire additional police officers and crisis responders and to house defendants being held for behavioral problems.\n\n\u201cTough on crime doesn\u2019t only mean let\u2019s pay attention to punishment after the fact,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Marcia Morey of Durham, a former judge. \u201cWe grieve the murder. It was senseless, it was horrible. But what you are voting on today does nothing to take it back or would have prevented it. Let\u2019s get smart on crime.\u201d\n\nUnlike Monday\u2019s party-line Senate vote, over one-third of House Democrats present joined all Republicans in voting for the bill Tuesday. The margins signal any Stein veto could be overridden.\n\nBill aims to end nearly 20-year halt of executions\n\nThe bill initially contained language that would require certain appeals for death row inmates be heard and reviewed by courts by the end of 2027. More than 120 people are on death row in North Carolina, but an execution hasn\u2019t been carried out since 2006.\n\nBut an amendment from powerful Senate leader Phil Berger would direct the state Adult Correction Department secretary to find another form of execution if lethal injection \u2014 currently the state\u2019s sole method \u2014 is declared unconstitutional or is \u201cnot available,\u201d potentially if the drugs can\u2019t be accessed.\n\nThe secretary would have to select another method that\u2019s been adopted by another state. That could include the use of a firing squad, a method used to execute South Carolina inmates twice this year, or perhaps electrocution.\n\nCapital punishment has been put on hold in North Carolina in part over legal challenges on the use of the injection drugs. Inmate challenges also have occurred under a now-repealed law that has allowed some prisoners to receive life without parole if they could show racial bias was the reason for their death sentence.\n\nBerger told reporters Monday that he would seek to loosen the knot that has halted executions.\n\n\u201cFor nearly two decades, judicial and administrative roadblocks have stopped true justice for victims, and it\u2019s time for that to end,\u201d Berger said in a news release Monday.\n\nDemocrats blasted Berger\u2019s addition, saying it\u2019s wrong and cynical to use the measure to push what one lawmaker called \u201cbarbaric\u201d punishments to take someone else\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cNo matter what you think about the death penalty more generally, there\u2019s just no question that these methods are risky and have the potential to be extremely gruesome,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Vernetta Alston, an attorney who previously represented death row inmates in appeals."

The vote also represents a startling turnaround in his own footballing arc, almost exactly 12 months on from being left out of the PSG squad to play Arsenal after a heated argument with his manager during a game at Rennes.\n\nA subsequent tactical switch by Luis Enrique, moving Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 into the centre, led to an explosion of 25 goals in 20 games from December to March, a run of form his manager put down to something his star attacker must have eaten over Christmas.\n\nThe culmination of that six-month surge arrived with May\u2019s annihilation of Inter in the Champions League final, a match marked by the spectacle of Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 literally crouching like a sprinter to begin his forward press.\n\nIt is a genuinely heartening comeback story for a likable, humble, prodigiously talented footballer, who was treated roughly at times at Barcelona as he struggled to adapt to the pressure of a hugely expensive move, but who saw off the darling of La Masia, Lamine Yamal, in the final vote here.\n\nAt the podium Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 struggled to hold back tears several times as he thanked everyone from his home suburb to his agent, before finally inviting his mother on stage to share the moment of glory.\n\nEarlier on it had also been a night of flowers for English football as the women\u2019s game swept the opening half of the ceremony. There were awards for England\u2019s head coach, Sarina Wiegman, the England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton and Arsenal as club of the year. Such was the degree of Anglo-dominance at that point there were scattered boos from the Parisian crowd as Arsenal\u2019s players went up to take their gong.\n\nAlessia Russo had been tipped to take the top individual women\u2019s award.

Russo came third behind her Arsenal teammate Mariona Caldentey.\n\nFrom early in the evening the venue had been crammed to the gods with gleamingly attired footballers, their glamorous hangers-on and the usual indeterminate men in flamboyant tuxedos. There was an early flush of excitement as the men\u2019s Kopa trophy for best young player was won for the second year running by Lamine Yamal, present in a deliciously soft and shiny deep blue suit and immaculate bleach rinse.\n\nAfter which, the English arrived. Wiegman won the Johan Cruyff award for top female coach, recognition of her success at the summer\u2019s Euros. The Lionesses coach went against the prevailing neutral tone, using the platform to speak about the need to remain vigilant as the sport grows.\n\n\u201cI see this award as a recognition of the women\u2019s game and of our journey and where we have come to so far. With that growth comes responsibility. We have to take that responsibility and try to keep our industry welcoming and inclusive, a place where everyone belongs.\n\n\u201cI hope we can keep fighting together against misogyny and \u00adracism. Football should always be united and never divided.\u201d\n\nHampton, of Chelsea and England, won the inaugural women\u2019s Yashin Trophy for goalkeeper of the year and paid an emotional tribute to Matt Beard, the former Liverpool Women manager, who died last week.\n\nManchester City\u2019s Gianluigi Donnarumma won the men\u2019s goalkeeping award, for which he was billed as a PSG player. But this was Paris and nobody was going to nitpick. Arsenal\u2019s Viktor Gy\u00f6keres won the Gerd M\u00fcller trophy as the highest scoring men\u2019s player, successor to Erling Haaland, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Harry Kane.\n\nThen came Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s moment, a victory that is significant not just for a PSG project which craves starry, brand-building heat, but for French football, which is for some reason convinced (incorrectly) that it never wins individual awards.\n\nIt was a triumph for Paris too, which has transformed this show of individual star appeal into a gaudy society event, the otherwise statesmanlike L\u2019\u00c9quipe trilling on the day of the \u00adceremony that the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet would host \u201cbeautiful people of all ranks\u201d. True to form the red carpet was a parade of courtiers, influencers, grifters, faces, mixed in with a very happy-looking Premier League champion manager, Arne Slot, his buffed and gleaming head startlingly luminous under the hard white lights.\n\nAbove all, bringing the Ballon d\u2019Or back to Paris is another moment of ascent for the PSG chair and most powerful person in European football, Nasser al-Khelaifi, who was also present early on to address his home audience, the first tell that Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 might just have won the men\u2019s prize."

                "text": "After being touted as one of the most wide-open Ballon d\u2019Or races of the past two decades, the event ended up being somewhat of a procession.\n\nIn front of an expectant crowd, Paris Saint-Germain forward and heavy favourite Ousmane Dembele became the first French player to win the award while playing in Ligue 1 since Jean Pierre-Papin in 1991. On the women\u2019s side, Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati collected her third successive Golden Ball, becoming the first women\u2019s player to achieve that feat, and just the third player ever after Lionel Messi and Michel Platini.\n\nThe Athletic was at the Theatre du Chatelet, covering the event from the pre-ceremony red carpet to when Dembele was escorted out of the building as hundreds of PSG fans lined the streets chanting his name. Here are five things you may have missed.\n\nOusmane Dembele\u2019s night\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t already enough of an open secret that Dembele was on track to become just the second PSG player to win the Ballon d\u2019Or (after Messi won in 2021), the number of Parisians who came out to support the Frenchman reinforced what we all knew was coming.\n\nEvery time a black van pulled up on the red carpet ready to offload a mystery collection of stars, chants of \u201cOusmane, Ballon d\u2019Or\u201d would break out among the hundreds of PSG and France fans awaiting the 28-year-old on his crowning day. As it happened, there were lots of frustrated groans until Dembele, one of the last people to show up to the ceremony, eventually arrived with his PSG team-mates. When he did, the crowd erupted \u2014 as it would several times that evening.\n\nIf you had followed Dembele\u2019s rapid rise from Rennes to Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona within two years, a night like this may have seemed plausible, if not likely, at some point in his career. But if you watched how the subsequent years at Barcelona unfolded, with Dembele falling out of favour in Catalonia before joining PSG in 2023, the idea of seeing his name on the trophy at some point would have felt far-fetched.\n\nAll of this contributed to making the night that little bit more special. Dembele broke down in tears during his speech, dedicating the award to his mother, who later joined him on stage. With hundreds of PSG supporters waiting outside in the pouring rain, Paris\u2019 adopted hero left to a rapturous reception.\n\nDembele watching PSG\n\nWhile PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi was at the event to accept the club of the year award for the first time, head coach Luis Enrique was forced into delivering his coach of the year acceptance speech via video.\n\nEnrique, as well as every other PSG player not in the running for an individual award, had to skip the event due to a rescheduling of their match against Marseille, which was postponed from Sunday to Monday evening due to storm threats.\n\nAs it transpired, the Spaniard missed his star attacker as well as Desire Doue and Joao Neves as PSG lost 1-0 at the Orange Velodrome. It is the first time Marseille have beaten PSG at home in 14 years.\n\nBut while his Ballon d\u2019Or success may have taken priority on Monday night, Dembele was still thinking about his team-mates playing down south. During the first ad break, he pulled out his phone and started watching a stream of the game.\n\nSchoolchildren bring the atmosphere\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long to become clear that PSG fans would dictate the noise outside the event, but with a mix of players, club staff, family and journalists, who drives the atmosphere inside the building?\n\nOn Monday night, there was a large group of local schoolchildren sitting in the upper reaches of the theatre, bringing the noise. They were partisan and unapologetic about it, too.\n\nEven Lamine Yamal, who may be just a year or two older than some of the group, was booed and jeered after he won the Kopa Trophy \u2014 the award for the best player under the age of 21 \u2014 ahead of PSG\u2019s Neves and Doue. Having thought the Club of the Year award was across both genders, they even heckled Arsenal Women when they took home the trophy. When it was revealed moments later that there was a men\u2019s award to come, which PSG duly won, loud cheers went up again.\n\nGiven this was largely PSG\u2019s and Dembele\u2019s night, having a large contingent of local and avid supporters of both of theirs proved to be a perfect storm.\n\nGullit and Wiegman\n\nSarina Wiegman is one of the best coaches in football, and fans of England\u2019s women\u2019s team are very fortunate to have her. She signed a new contract in January 2024, around 18 months before winning the European Championship this summer. She is now committed until 2027.\n\nBut, even with her immediate future seemingly set in stone, fans (even ones who have played 66 times for said country) wishing to add a bit of Wiegman magic to their favourite national team can\u2019t help but chance their arm. Following an incredible speech by the 55-year-old, where she promoted inclusivity and a desire to remove misogyny and racism from the game, compatriot Ruud Gullit said: \u201cPlease, please, please come back to Holland!\u201d\n\nWiegman, who spent the entirety of her coaching career in her home country before becoming England boss in 2021, coached the Netherlands on a permanent basis between 2016 and 2021, winning the Euros and reaching the final of the World Cup.\n\nHowever, fortunately for fans of the Lionesses, her response was short but assuring: \u201cI\u2019m staying in England for a while.\u201d\n\nTribute to Diogo Jota and Andre Silva\n\nOnly two months on, the tragic passing of Diogo Jota and Andre Silva continues to affect the football world profoundly.\n\nDuring the ceremony, a segment was played of Jota\u2019s goals for Liverpool, ending with a picture of him and his brother together while they were playing for Porto. Rute Cardoso, Jota\u2019s widow, attended the ceremony and watched as the theatre gave ovations to the former Liverpool and Portugal star and Silva, who most recently played for Penafiel in Portugal\u2019s second tier.\n\n(Top photo: Kristy Sparow \u2013 UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)"

Regularly reviewing and updating beneficiary selections is crucial, especially after significant life changes, to ensure that your assets are distributed according to your current wishes.",
                "source": "cnn",
                "text": "Maybe you\u2019ve heard of \u201cThe Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning.\u201d It\u2019s a guide to proactively downsizing your stuff while you\u2019re still alive. Doing so spares your heirs the mess of doing it themselves, and the potential fights they may have in the process.\n\nSimilarly, you can avoid leaving a mess behind for your family by being meticulous now about identifying who you want to get your money but also knowing a little about how the process will play out when you\u2019re gone.\n\nSpecifically, you should be aware of the importance of naming beneficiaries on key financial accounts, such as your 401(k)s and IRAs, as well as your life insurance policies and annuities, and sometimes even your brokerage and banking accounts.\n\nPut simply, anyone you name as a beneficiary on those accounts will be the person who gets the money, regardless of the wishes you express in any of your other estate planning documents.\n\n\u201cIf you have designated beneficiaries on an account and they\u2019re living, that trumps your will or trust \u2014 unless the beneficiary designation is to the trust,\u201d said Jeffrey R. Gottlieb, an estate planning attorney in the northwest suburbs of Chicago.\n\nIt will also streamline the process of the money from a given account being transferred quickly to your beneficiaries. That\u2019s because the account with named beneficiaries won\u2019t be in the part of your estate that must go through the court process of probate, which authenticates your will after you die and allows for the net proceeds of your estate to be distributed to your heirs once your debts and expenses are paid.\n\nSettling your estate can be very upsetting for your family if a financial account is given to a beneficiary who was not in your life at the time you died. Think here about an ex-spouse you no longer want to leave money to but whose name you never took off the account. Or a person you named as a beneficiary who has already died.\n\nThat\u2019s why, Gottlieb said, \u201cIt\u2019s very important to update your beneficiary designation whenever there\u2019s a (big) life change.\u201d\n\nIn the case of a beneficiary who pre-deceases you, the person next in line to get their share of your money will depend on what you specified when filling out your beneficiary form.\n\nFor example, say you left half of your 401(k) to your brother. If he dies before you, who do you want to get his share? His children? The other account beneficiaries? Someone else entirely? A charity?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always important to consider when doing a designation whether you want a beneficiary\u2019s kids to receive it, or other beneficiaries,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\nWhat if you don\u2019t name anyone on your financial accounts?\n\nIf you haven\u2019t named any beneficiaries, the default beneficiary for your account in most instances is your estate.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t name them on accounts, the money gets marshalled into your estate and goes through probate court,\u201d said John Rossi, an Ohio-based attorney with probate estate litigation experience and a consultant to Steward, an online estate planning service that provides a technology platform to create a trust with guidance from attorneys.\n\nAnd if you die without a valid will also, how your assets get divvied up will be determined by the intestacy laws of the state where you were living when you died. That is, each state determines who is entitled to inherit your assets and in what order, although Gottlieb said some 401(k) plans may automatically default to your spouse or children. So it\u2019s a good idea to find out what yours says specifically.\n\nWhen it makes sense to name a trust as an account beneficiary\n\nJust as the accounts on which you name beneficiaries will be able to bypass the probate process, so too will anything you include in a trust.\n\nTrusts, which are no longer just the go-to estate planning tool for the wealthy, are somewhat more complex and expensive to set up than a will. But a trust can offer you more control over how your assets eventually get distributed.\n\nFor example, say you want to leave your 401(k) to your kids. But they are too young to manage that inheritance \u2014 i.e., under 18. Or maybe you have an adult child who has an addiction and/or is very poor at managing money. Or you have a child who is disabled and will need lifelong financial support. If your kids are named directly on your 401(k) account itself, the money would be paid out to them immediately. But if you set up a trust for them and name that trust as a beneficiary of your 401(k), you can dictate the terms and dates of how that money is managed and when it should be paid out to them.\n\n\u201cThink through how that money will flow to those beneficiaries,\u201d Gottlieb said, noting that you may want the money to stay in the trust for a long period of time or you may want it paid out over a specific number of years.\n\nBut whenever making those kinds of decisions, he added, you and your estate attorney need to be mindful of the tax implications as well as legal requirements under laws like the federal Secure Act, which requires beneficiaries take their distributions from an inherited IRA over a fixed number of years.\n\nPeriodically review beneficiary selections\n\nChances are you have a busy life and many financial accounts and policies, some of which were set up years ago,\n\nSo this is your reminder to a) check who you named way back when; and b) make sure those names still reflect the people you want to have your money, especially if their (or your) family structures and financial fortunes have changed dramatically since you first named them.\n\nAnd, if you still haven\u2019t named any beneficiaries on your accounts, now is as good time to do so as any."

                "text": "Day-one fans of Taylor Swift know that the pop superstar has come a long way since launching her music career as a country singer \u2014 and that evolution is apparent in her dialect, according to speech scientists.\n\nFrom Tennessee to Pennsylvania to New York, the career of the 14-time Grammy award winner has taken her \u201cin and out of communities that have distinct regional or socio-cultural dialects,\u201d two researchers from the University of Minnesota wrote in their study, published Tuesday in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.\n\nStudy authors Miski Mohamed and Matthew Winn noted that the singer\u2019s numerous interviews and media appearances across the span of her career to date gave them a \u201crare opportunity\u201d to observe dialect change over a prolonged period of time, in a way that \u201cwould be virtually impossible to observe in a controlled laboratory study.\u201d This, they say, could have implications for our understanding of the influence of place, profession and leadership goals on how a person\u2019s dialect adapts later in life.\n\nBorn in Pennsylvania in 1989, Swift moved to Tennessee at age 13 to gain the attention of country labels in Nashville.\n\nThere, she found success as a young country artist, releasing her hit country pop album \u201cFearless\u201d in 2008.\n\nA transition to more mainstream pop became evident in the release of her 2012 album \u201cRed,\u201d with lead single \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Swift moved to New York and released her fifth studio album, titled \u201c1989,\u201d which she described as her first \u201cofficial pop album.\u201d It featured hit singles \u201cBad Blood,\u201d \u201cBlank Space\u201d and \u201cShake It Off.\u201d\n\nThe researchers analyzed changes in Swift\u2019s accent between 2008 and 2019, extracting audio from interviews on YouTube and elsewhere online.\n\nEach interview was linked with the promotion of a specific album, and the researchers chose the albums based on where Swift lived when recording and promoting them.\n\nOne set of interviews was related to her 2008 country album \u201cFearless\u201d in Nashville; another was related to her transitional fourth studio album, \u201cRed,\u201d made in Philadelphia; and the final set was related to her seventh studio album, \u201cLover,\u201d which was notably pop and made in New York in 2019, according to the study.\n\nA total of 45 minutes, 24 minutes and 37 minutes of speech audio were analyzed for each of Swift\u2019s Nashville, Philadelphia and New York City eras, respectively.\n\nThe researchers then made acoustic measurements for \u201chundreds and hundreds of vowels that Taylor spoke during these interviews,\u201d study co-author and speech communication scientist Winn told CNN.\n\nVocal eras\n\nAfter comparing the acoustic measurements across Swift\u2019s different eras, the researchers saw signatures of changes in how she pronounced her vowels \u201cthat were consistent with markers of speaking a Southern dialect in Nashville and then losing those features when she went back to Philadelphia,\u201d Winn said.\n\nThe trajectory of her tongue movement was shorter when Swift pronounced the /a\u026a/ vowel during her time in Nashville, making a word like \u201cride\u201d sound more like \u201crod.\u201d This is a feature connected to a Southern dialect, according to the study.\n\nSwift lengthened her pronunciation of the /a\u026a/ vowel when she relocated to Philadelphia and it remained that way in New York City. The ending of the sound of the vowel when Swift was in New York was so high that \u201cit is tempting to interpret it as a hyper-correction away from the Southern dialect,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nWhile Swift was in Nashville, her fronting \u2014 articulating a vowel with the tongue more forward \u2014 of the /u/ vowel was much more exaggerated than in her other eras, confirming that she was adopting a Southern accent, the study authors said.\n\nThis made her pronounce words like \u201ctwo\u201d in a way that sounded like \u201ctee-you,\u201d according to a press statement accompanying the study, but this disappeared when Swift moved back to Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to continue finding evidence that that\u2019s true \u2014 that a person, as they go through adulthood, they still find reasons to change how they sound to fit in with their community,\u201d said Winn.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think of dialects as just belonging to geographic regions, at least in the United States, and that\u2019s part of it. But, there are so many more factors that people have to change how they speak, including the social community that they\u2019re in. And so, because Taylor Swift was moving into this country music community, that was another piece of the reason why her voice might have changed,\u201d he added.\n\nAccents and activism\n\nSwift\u2019s pitch was also \u201csignificantly lower\u201d during her New York City era, according to the study, which noted that a lower voice pitch is often used by talkers to signal confidence and authority on important topics, and make the speaker more likely to be perceived as a leader.\n\n\u201cThis era coincided with her increased visibility speaking out on issues of social change, sexism, double-standards, musicians\u2019 rights, and her own autonomy in her musical career,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nSwift promoted LGBTQ equality at MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards in 2019, and went on to sing about youth mobilization in her 2020 song \u201cOnly The Young\u201d and endorse the Democrats.\n\nHelen West, a senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Chester in the UK, who is part of the \u201cThe Swift Accent Shift Project\u201d team at the university, said she was \u201cexcited\u201d that the results in the Minnesota study were similar to those found by her team on Swift\u2019s singing accent.\n\n\u201cWhat I found especially notable about this study of her interviews was not just that Taylor Swift adapted her accent to align with living near Nashville and performing country-style music, and then shifted to accent features associated with the northern US as her genre moved toward pop (a finding our own study corroborates in the analysis of her accent in her singing/music), but also that she potentially lowered the pitch of her voice to sound more authoritative when discussing social issues,\u201d West, who was not involved in the latest study, added.\n\n\u201cThis demonstrates how adaptable our accents can be, depending on our sense of identity, our social context, our perception of our audience/who we are speaking to, and the nature of the message we wish to convey at any given time.\u201d\n\nHowever, while it is possible that Swift lowered her pitch \u201cto signal the seriousness of these themes, and to convey her competence to speak on them with authority,\u201d her pitch change also coincides with her aging from 19 to 30 years old, the researchers noted.\n\nA similar pattern of voice pitch lowering was observed in the speech of Queen Elizabeth II during the same period of life, as well as among women in their 30s, and so \u201ccould just be a simple pattern associated with aging through her 20s,\u201d they added.\n\n\u2018Wasn\u2019t her \u201creal\u201d accent\u2019\n\nIn May, Swift announced that she had taken ownership of her entire catalogue of music, years after her master recordings were sold by her former record label, and confirmed that she had completed the highly anticipated re-recording of her 2006 self-titled debut album, \u201cTaylor Swift.\u201d\n\nFans \u201chave been discussing this for decades,\u201d writer Elly McCausland, a professor of English Literature at Ghent University in Belgium who curated the course \u201cLiterature: Taylor\u2019s Version,\u201d told CNN.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s speculated that this is why Taylor has waited so long to re-record her debut album, because she\u2019d have to re-adopt the Southern country accent that wasn\u2019t her \u2018real\u2019 accent in the first place,\u201d continued McCausland, who was not involved in the study.\n\n\u201cI think it says more about the kind of accent that is expected from certain music genres than anything else, country music being predominantly associated with the US South,\u201d she added.\n\nHowever, the study authors noted that since they were listening to recordings of casual speech used in ordinary conversations and not in the controlled environment of a lab, and as they could not speak to Swift herself, their study alone cannot determine the array of reasons the artist might have consciously or unconsciously altered her speech as her career progressed."

                "text": "Astronomers are trying to understand what caused a series of gamma ray bursts, or GRBs \u2014 the most powerful explosions in the universe.\n\nThese energetic bursts are typically unleashed by the incendiary death of a star, or when it is shredded by a black hole.\n\nThe observation of repeating bursts has never occurred before, given that the events that produce them are so catastrophic, said Antonio Martin-Carrillo, an assistant professor in astrophysics at the University College Dublin in Ireland. But in July, several bursts were detected in a single day.\n\n\u201c(It\u2019s) unlike any other seen in 50-years of GRB observations,\u201d Martin-Carrillo said in a statement. He is the co-lead author of a study based on observations of the event published August 29 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nEnergetic gamma-ray bursts typically last milliseconds to minutes, but in this case, the signal repeated three times over 24 hours, making them aggregately 100 to 1,000 times longer than most single GRBs, said co-lead study author Andrew Levan, an astronomer at Radboud University in the Netherlands.\n\nThe exact reason for the bursts remains unknown, but astronomers have working theories. Zeroing in on what caused them could change the way researchers understand the death of stars.\n\n\u201cIs this event really rare so that we\u2019ve only seen one of them in 50 years, or is it the tip of the iceberg where we might find many more of them if we look carefully?\u201d Levan said. \u201cBecause gamma-ray bursts come from the catastrophic deaths of stars, this might really tell us a lot more about some of the most extreme ways that stars end their lives.\u201d\n\nThe search for a distant galaxy\n\nOn July 2, NASA\u2019s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected the succession of four gamma-ray bursts from a similar region of the sky, drawing the attention of astronomers who wondered if they could all be linked to the same source, said Martin-Carrillo. Further analysis later determined that three of the four bursts were related.\n\nFermi was only able to provide a rough location for the origin of the bursts. But better positional data captured by an X-ray telescope called the Einstein Probe \u2014 a mission undertaken by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the European Space Agency and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics \u2014 enabled astronomers to determine where to begin pointing their ground-based telescopes. The Einstein Probe had detected X-ray activity the day before the bursts, which was discovered retroactively.\n\nFollowing up on the Einstein Probe\u2019s data, NASA\u2019s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory\u2019s X-ray instrument also provided more accurate location information to help orient telescopes in the right direction.\n\nThe research team was able to determine that the GRBs occurred outside our galaxy by tracing the radiation they emitted using the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large Telescope and its HAWK-I camera in Chile. Further confirmation of its extragalactic origin came from images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThe team suspects the host galaxy is a few billion light-years away, but research to determine the exact galaxy and distance is ongoing.\n\n\u201cKnowing the distance will help us considerably understand the true nature of this source,\u201d Martin-Carrillo said.\n\nContinued observations with other telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope, could refine the measurements and ultimately determine the root cause of the repeated bursts.\n\nOn the hunt for an origin\n\nCurrently, the authors have considered two possible causes for the repeating bursts. One is an unusual type of supernova explosion that lasted much longer than those that typically release gamma rays, Levan said.\n\n\u201cIf this is a massive star,\u201d he said, \u201cit is a collapse unlike anything we have ever witnessed before.\u201d\n\nAnother potential cause is a white dwarf \u2014 a dead star as heavy as our sun but condensed to the size of Earth \u2014 being ripped apart by a rare intermediate-mass black hole.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s either one of a kind in half a century, or it\u2019s from a small group of events,\u201d said Dr. Eric Burns, associate professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University.\n\nBurns was not involved in the new study, but he is part of a research group that intends to make a strong assertion in a study next month about what caused the event.\n\nThe recent series of bursts are why so many astronomers have dedicated time to carrying out diverse telescope observations to follow-up on the event, said Brendan O\u2019Connor, a McWilliams Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University. O\u2019Connor did not participate in this study but is leading his own research on the accompanying X-ray data.\n\nBurns and O\u2019Connor are coordinating and sharing what they find with one another, while formally working on separate results.\n\nThe new study presents critical information that solidifies an extragalactic origin for the event, O\u2019Connor said.\n\n\u201cThey provide a great summary of the likely culprits for producing this extremely long duration event,\u201d O\u2019Connor wrote in an email. \u201cHowever, the precise nature of this event is still an open question and it is not cleanly described by any of the usual suspects.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding cosmic lighthouses\n\nAll the research about the gamma-ray burst event comes at a crucial time for those who study these energetic phenomena.\n\nBurns runs a consortium called the InterPlanetary Network made up of a dozen satellites that identify where gamma-ray bursts originate.\n\n\u201cI think part of the reason that we haven\u2019t seen events like this before is that we haven\u2019t had the right instruments,\u201d Burns said. \u201cWhat we need is (to build) a new gamma-ray burst monitor that has the deep sensitivity we need but placing it far from Earth.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the monitor would orbit at L2, or Lagrange point 2, about 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth, where the Webb telescope is located. This vantage point is ideal because it enables telescopes to have an unimpeded view of the universe, unlike Hubble, which moves in and out of Earth\u2019s shadow every 90 minutes.\n\nThe Astro2020 Decadal Survey, released in November 2021, identifies scientific priorities for the decade ahead, focusing on unlocking the secrets of the universe. One of its recommendations was for higher sensitivity gamma-ray telescopes to observe how space varies over time, Burns said.\n\nBurns and his colleagues designed a mission to do just that, and won a NASA competition three years ago, but it wasn\u2019t funded due to budget issues. The team is still pursuing the mission, but it\u2019s unclear if it will happen under the current administration, Burns said.\n\n\u201cNASA is in a precarious position at the moment where they\u2019re just trying to keep their current plans running,\u201d he said, \u201cso I\u2019m not sure what the timeline will be.\u201d\n\nThe InterPlanetary Network relies on a dozen satellites, and at the moment, Burns doesn\u2019t know if they will be shut off before Congress passes a budget. The astronomy community depends on the network to highlight intriguing signals that warrant further observation, Burns added.\n\n\u201cNone of us can plan what proposals to put in for, what telescopes to use, because we don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll even be finding anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nStudying and understanding gamma-ray bursts provides insight into the universe, Levan said. Within seconds, gamma-ray bursts can create as much energy as the sun does over the course of its ultimately 10 billion-year lifetime, he added. Currently, the sun is an estimated 4.6 billion years old.\n\n\u201cThey are really bright, and so act as a lighthouse to the distant Universe saying \u2018look here,\u2019\u201d Levan wrote in an email. \u201cWe can use them to study really distant objects.\u201d\n\nGamma-ray bursts are like having an extreme laboratory in space unlike anything that can be built on Earth, Martin-Carrillo said. They can be used to test electromagnetism, particle physics and Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity.\n\n\u201cTheir huge energy output means that we can detect them across the full Universe,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cand thus, they can provide a unique window into the early universe and the first stars that were produced.\u201d"

The stakes are massive for the US economy and the business world.\n\n\u201cI have never been this concerned about democracy in the United States,\u201d Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow of governance studies at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, told CNN in a phone interview.\n\nCEOs are growing alarmed \u2014 even if they\u2019re publicly staying quiet to avoid the wrath of the White House.\n\nBusiness leaders are \u201cquite alarmed\u201d in private about the state of democracy in the United States, according to Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, the Yale professor known as the \u201cCEO Whisperer\u201d due to his extensive rolodex in the business community.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a serious erosion of the foundations of democracy,\u201d Sonnenfeld, founder and president of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute, told CNN.\n\nResearch shows that democracies tend to thrive financially.\n\n\u201cDemocracy is just good for the economy. And autocracy is bad for the economy,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cAutocrats are just not good at managing economies. Policymaking tends to be erratic as democratic institutions decline.\u201d\n\nDemocratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20% in the long run, according to a 2019 study titled \u201cDemocracy does cause growth\u201d that was published in the Journal of Political Economy, a University of Chicago peer-reviewed journal.\n\nResearchers said the positive effects of democracy \u201cappear to be driven by greater investment in capital, schooling and health.\u201d\n\n\u2018Rapidly\u2019 eroding democracy\n\nOn the other hand, scholars have found countries governed by populists are worse off.\n\n\u201cPopulist leaders leave a long-lasting negative imprint on the economic and political pathways of countries,\u201d researchers concluded in a 2023 study published by the American Economic Review.\n\nThey studied 51 populist presidents and prime ministers who were in power between 1900 and 2020 and found that after 15 years, GDP per capita was 10% lower when compared with a plausible nonpopulist counterfactual.\n\n\u201cPopulists typically assume office as antiestablishment politicians who claim to represent \u2018the common people\u2019 and to improve their economic fortunes,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cHowever, they typically do not deliver.\u201d\n\nWilliamson, the Brookings fellow, argued the United States \u201cexperienced democratic erosion slowly\u201d in recent years and \u201crapidly this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s troubling is we\u2019re trending in the direction of the worst-case scenarios I\u2019ve envisioned,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai argued the Trump administration is \u201crestoring confidence and economic dynamism\u201d by pointing to \u201ctrillions\u201d of dollars of investment commitments from Apple, Nvidia, Merck and other global corporations.\n\n\u201cThese political \u2018scientists\u2019 should\u2019ve spoken up during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, when Biden officials eroded American democracy by pressuring social media companies to censor Americans\u2019 free speech, by flooding our country with tens of millions of illegal aliens, and by weaponizing the justice system against political opponents \u2013 on top of inflicting the worst inflation crisis on everyday Americans in decades,\u201d Desai said. \u201cThe Trump administration is correcting government overreach, incompetence, and weaponization while implementing the most aggressive pro-growth economic agenda in modern American history.\u201d\n\n\u2018Horrifying\u2019 pressure on media\n\nThe latest flashpoint: Brendan Carr, the Trump-nominated chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, suggested the regulator would make life difficult for Disney and ABC if they didn\u2019t take action to address on-air remarks comedian Jimmy Kimmel made about the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nKimmel\u2019s show was later suspended indefinitely by ABC in a move that was hailed by Trump.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you would expect to see in an unfree country. It\u2019s straight from the autocratic playbook,\u201d Williamson said.\n\nSonnenfeld said Trump\u2019s threats to pull broadcast licenses over critical coverage of the administration is \u201chorrifying.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe erosion of free expression in the media is really alarming,\u201d Sonnenfeld said.\n\nTrump has surprised some by the intensity of his attacks on the Federal Reserve, which is designed to be independent from political interference.\n\nLast month, Trump fired Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who has fought back in court.\n\nAfter a brutal jobs report on August 1, Trump fired the leader of the agency that compiles the report and accused her, without evidence, of cooking the books.\n\nErika McEntarfer, the fired commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said last week the firing \u201cmade no sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cFiring your chief statistician is a dangerous step,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s an attack on the independence of an institution arguably as important as the Federal Reserve for economic stability. It has serious economic consequences.\u201d\n\nState ownership of private business\n\nTrump has also surprised some by taking a heavy-handed approach with private businesses.\n\nFor instance, Trump demanded the resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan over his ties to China.\n\nTrump later praised the Intel CEO and presided over a controversial decision to invest taxpayer money in the $8.9 billion in the beleaguered chipmaker.\n\nAlthough the Intel investment won praise from Sen. Bernie Sanders, some Republicans are troubled.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been teaching the world that state-owned enterprises are unfair. But now Intel is a state-owned enterprise,\u201d Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, told CNN in a phone interview.\n\nHoltz-Eakin, the president of center-right think tank American Action Forum, told CNN the government is \u201coverstepping boundaries\u201d by taking stakes in private companies.\n\n\u201cNow Intel has deeper pockets than anyone else. And politically, we\u2019re never going to let Intel fail. We can\u2019t admit it was a bad idea,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government should stay out.\u201d\n\nThe Intel investment came months after the Trump administration approved Nippon Steel\u2019s takeover of US Steel in a deal that granted the federal government a \u201cgolden share\u201d that could give US officials a say in how the private enterprise is run.\n\nIn July, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder in MP Materials, a publicly traded company and the nation\u2019s largest rare earths miner.\n\n\u2018MAGA has gone Maoist\u2019\n\nMike Pence, Trump\u2019s former vice president, noted on CNBC last week that \u201cstate ownership of business is very common in China and Russia\u201d \u2014 two nations that are far from democracies.\n\nSuch moves have \u201ctaken our country to a very perilous place and I think we need to resist that very strongly,\u201d Pence said.\n\nSonnenfeld, the Yale professor, went a step further by describing the federal government\u2019s \u201cintrusion\u201d into the private sector.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if MAGA has gone Maoist, if not Marxist,\u201d Sonnenfeld said.\n\nPublicly, most business leaders have been relatively quiet about these issues.\n\nCEOs know that if they speak up, they risk drawing the ire of the president.\n\nIn May, Trump threatened to slap a 100% tariff on all of Mattel\u2019s imports after the toymaker\u2019s CEO acknowledged it would have to consider price hikes due to tariffs.\n\nBut in private, Sonnenfeld says, CEOs have expressed major concern about pressure on democracy in the United States.\n\nThe Yale professor said the business community is \u201csplintering,\u201d meeting with the president sector by sector instead of speaking with one voice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing those forceful voices come together,\u201d Sonnenfeld said. \u201cBut they need to.

Americans\u2019 intense dissatisfaction eased last year, to 51%, and inched down further this year.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nEach month, Gallup asks Americans whether they are satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in the U.S. Periodically, including in most January Mood of the Nation polls, Gallup has asked a follow-up question probing the intensity of Americans\u2019 satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The Jan. 2-22 survey finds 5% of U.S. adults are very satisfied, 18% somewhat satisfied, 28% somewhat dissatisfied and 48% very dissatisfied.\n\nIn most years since 2007, more people have been very dissatisfied with the state of the nation than either somewhat dissatisfied or satisfied. During this time, the average percentage very dissatisfied has been 46%.\n\nStrong dissatisfaction reached its peak in 2021, at 66%, amid the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot and a then-record number of U.S. coronavirus cases and deaths.\n\nOverall Satisfaction Similar to Last Month, but Higher Than a Year Ago\n\nThe 23% of Americans who are satisfied today represents an increase from January 2022 (17%) and January 2021 (11%), but it is similar to the 22% Gallup measured in its December poll.\n\nIn 2022, satisfaction ranged from a low of 13% in June and July, a time of high gas prices and rising inflation, to a high of 24% in March.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nFrom a broader historical perspective, Americans\u2019 satisfaction remains below the 36% average in all measures since Gallup first asked the question in 1979.\n\nAll Major Party Groups Rate State of Nation Negatively\n\nMajorities of all three major political party groups are dissatisfied with the state of the nation, although there is a difference in degree. While a larger proportion of Democrats are \u201csomewhat\u201d (36%) rather than \u201cvery\u201d (28%) dissatisfied, the largest shares of independents (46%) and Republicans (75%) are very dissatisfied.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nThe decline in strong dissatisfaction over the past two years is mainly seen among Democrats, though fewer independents have said they were very dissatisfied in each of the past two years.\n\nMeanwhile, the percentage of Republicans who are very dissatisfied has ticked up since 2021, likely because of the change from a Republican to a Democratic presidential administration that occurred after the 2021 survey was conducted.\n\n###Embeddable###\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Gallup News insights and updates, follow us on Twitter.\n\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works."

This trend poses challenges for Democrats, who must not only criticize Trump but also improve their own appeal to voters, particularly given the historical context of midterm elections. While the GOP is well-positioned heading into the 2024 elections, factors like potential changes in Trump's approval ratings and economic conditions could influence voter sentiment.",

                "text": "Common wisdom holds that Democrats are likely to retake the House in next year\u2019s midterms. Perhaps \u2014 that\u2019s what history would suggest.\n\nBut a recent poll shows that Republicans retain relative strength on important core issues.\n\nCNN\u2019s Harry Enten summarized those data well in a recent appearance: Looking at the Washington Post/IPSOS poll, Enten found that Republicans retained a lead over Democrats on which party voters trust more to handle the economy, crime and immigration.\n\nThe numbers aren\u2019t close, either.\n\nThe GOP leads the Democrats by 7 percentage points on the economy, 13 points on immigration and a whopping 22 points on crime.\n\nIf those are the issues voters care most about next November, it\u2019s hard to see the GOP losing control. Why toss out the party you trust for one that you don\u2019t?\n\nThose leads aren\u2019t just the result of partisan Republicans rallying around Trump, either.\n\nThe party leads Democrats on all three issues with independents, too.\n\nIt will be very hard for Democrats to prevail if they cannot close these gaps among the voters whose support is crucial for their hopes.\n\nThis points to a hard fact for Democrats. It\u2019s not enough to attack Trump and drive up dissatisfaction; they have to build themselves up, too.\n\nThat\u2019s not something they\u2019ve been able to do all year despite the turmoil Trump\u2019s tariffs and rhetoric have caused.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 surprisingly strong showing in the 2022 midterms is a great example of that principle at work.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was much more unpopular back then than Trump is now. Trump has a 46% job approval rating on the RealClearPolitics polling average. Biden\u2019s was an atrocious 42% as 2022\u2019s Election Day dawned.\n\nDemocrats nevertheless gained a seat in the Senate and lost only 9 House seats, surprising election analysts who expected a stronger night for team red.\n\nPost-election analysis showed why that happened: The president\u2019s party typically loses big with voters who \u201csomewhat disapprove\u201d of the president\u2019s job performance. But in 2022 Democrats won that demographic by 4 points.\n\nThey did that by focusing on the choice between Trump\u2019s Republicans and the Democrats.\n\nYes, they tacitly conceded, things might not be going the way you want. But can you trust them to do better?\n\nVoters who weren\u2019t crazy about Biden nonetheless decided they preferred his party to the GOP. That changed by 2024, but that\u2019s because Biden didn\u2019t turn the country around in the extra time voters gave him.\n\nThe poll numbers show that Trump is well positioned to play the same game next year.\n\nYou may not love me, he can argue, but you cannot trust them.\n\nHe\u2019s done that in both of his election wins already.\n\nTrump carried voters who did not like either major party candidate in 2016 and 2024. That\u2019s why he won both races: Voters saw him as the lesser of two evils each time.\n\nThis is not to say that the GOP has things in the bag.\n\nTrump still inspires massive amounts of hatred among Democrats. That passion could easily inspire a higher relative turnout for them, a factor that could help them mitigate their structural disadvantage.\n\nTrump\u2019s standing could also fall in the intervening year.\n\nIf unemployment goes up and inflation doesn\u2019t go down, that edge on the economy could go away. Other events could go poorly for Trump as well.\n\nIt\u2019s still worth noting two things: Trump\u2019s job approval ratings remain historically high for him, and his party remains more trusted than its opponent.\n\nAll things considered, that\u2019s not a bad place to be a year or so out from the midterms.\n\nHenry Olsen, a political analyst and commentator, is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center."

                "text": "Sky-gazers should get ready for a full day of celestial events on Sunday, including a partial solar eclipse in parts of the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThe partial solar eclipse will peak, the point at which the moon blocks the largest portion of the sun\u2019s surface, at 3:41 p.m. ET. But the entire event, as the moon moves between Earth and the sun, will be visible from 1:29 p.m. through 5:53 p.m. ET, according to EarthSky.\n\nUnlike during a total solar eclipse, the moon will only partially obscure the sun\u2019s face, making it look like it is taking a \u201cbite\u201d out of the sun.\n\nBut this partial eclipse will only be seen in limited areas.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re living in the US, this isn\u2019t a great solar eclipse to see, because it\u2019s really going to be visible from the South Pacific, New Zealand and Antarctica in this particular case,\u201d Jason Rhodes, chief scientist for astronomy and physics at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in an email.\n\nAdditionally, the partial solar eclipse will be visible in parts of Australia, according to Time and Date.\n\n\u201cWe live in a very unique system (Earth/Moon/Sun) so that the Moon and the Sun are very nearly the same size in our sky. The Sun is physically much bigger but much farther (away from Earth) so that it is just about the same size as the Moon,\u201d Rhodes said.\n\n\u201cSo, we can get a chance superposition (or alignment) of the moon in front of the sun that can either partially or completely block the sun. And we call this an eclipse.\u201d\n\nHow to see the eclipse safely\n\nAnyone planning to watch the eclipse should remember to use safe solar viewing methods. Forgetting to do so can cause severe eye injury. No part of a partial solar eclipse is safe to view without proper eye protection because some of the sun\u2019s powerful light will always be visible.\n\nTo observe the partial solar eclipse safely, wear certified eclipse glasses or use a handheld solar viewer labeled with the ISO 12312-2 international standard. If you normally wear eyeglasses, keep them on and put eclipse glasses over them or hold a handheld viewer in front of them, according to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nPut on your eclipse glasses before looking up and remember to turn away from the sun before removing them. Always keep an eye on children wearing eclipse glasses to make sure they don\u2019t remove them while looking at the sun.\n\nSunglasses won\u2019t work in place of eclipse glasses or solar viewers, which are 100,000 times darker and held to an international safety standard.\n\nYou can also observe the sun with a telescope, binoculars or camera that has a special solar filter on the front, which acts the same way eclipse glasses would. Don\u2019t look at the sun through any unfiltered optical device \u2014 camera lens, telescope, binoculars \u2014 while wearing eclipse glasses or using a handheld solar viewer, NASA advises. Solar rays can still burn through the filter on the glasses or viewer, given how concentrated they can be through an optical device, and can cause severe eye damage.\n\nA glimpse of Saturn\n\nThose in the Northern Hemisphere who cannot see the partial solar eclipse will have a chance to see a celestial event this weekend because Saturn will be at opposition on Sunday at 2 a.m. ET.\n\n\u201cWhen a planet is in opposition, it means the planet is on the opposite side of the Earth than the sun. So the sun is in one direction and the planet is in another direction,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cAnd for planets (farther) from the sun than the Earth, this is the best time to view them, because it\u2019s the time they\u2019ll be brightest in the sky.\u201d\n\nFor best time of visibility, you can consult a planetary calculator. Saturn will remain visible through early October.\n\n\u201cYou can easily see Saturn when it\u2019s at opposition with your naked eye,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cBut if you have some time, I suggest to people that they find a local astronomy club and they go look at Saturn through a telescope.\u201d\n\nWithout a telescope, Saturn will appear as bright as the brightest star, but with one, you\u2019ll be able to see the planet\u2019s famous rings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering a moon phase where the moon isn\u2019t going to be so bright in the sky,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cAnd so this is a particularly good year for the Saturn opposition.\u201d\n\nUpcoming full moons\n\nLook out for three more full moons this year, with supermoons \u2014 full moons that appear while the moon is at its closest to Earth \u2014 occurring in October, November and December.\n\nHere\u2019s the list of full moons remaining in 2025, according to the Farmers\u2019 Almanac:\n\nUpcoming meteor showers\n\nHere are the peak dates of the remaining meteor showers in 2025, according to the American Meteor Society and EarthSky."

EDT, bringing with it the end of summer, the beginning of fall, and the onset of Libra season.\n\nLeaves are turning, daylight is waning, and the winds of change are blowing, folks. What does it mean from an astrological perspective?\n\nAs the smell of melting popsicles and sunscreen gives way to root vegetables and flannel, balance is being sought, and harvests of the literal and metaphorical variety are in order.\n\nAstronomically, an equinox occurs when the sun crosses the equator. The term combines the Latin word aequi, meaning \u201cequal,\u201d with nox, meaning \u201cnight.\u201d\n\nThe fall equinox marks one of the two days of the year, the other being the spring or vernal equinox, when day and night are absolute equals.\n\nAs we move further into fall, the hours of sun we see will continue to diminish until we reach the winter solstice on December 21.\n\nThe significance of equinoxes in astrology\n\nSolstices and equinoxes correlate to cardinal signs and the beginning of their respective seasons; the spring equinox ushers in the newborn, fresh blood, fire sign of Aries, the summer solstice floods us with Cancer, and the winter solstice arrives on the hooves of Capricorn.\n\nSince the fall equinox steadies night and day and heralds the arrival of Libra, the sign of the scales and partnership, themes of balance and reflection, collection and release are nigh. Masculine and feminine, dark and light, past and future, all find their home here.\n\nStanding square between sun and shadow, we are invited not to hide but to seek, allowing the dark parts of ourselves to be known and the torches of our potential to illuminate where we have been and cast us towards where we are going.\n\nEquinoxes in myth\n\nThe fall equinox is associated with the ancient Eleusinian Mysteries and the ritual practices that honored the Greek goddess Persephone\u2019s descent into and return from the underworld.\n\nAccording to myth, Persephone, daughter of Demeter, the goddess of the harvest, was taken to the world below on a black chariot to be the bride of Hades/Pluto, god of the dead.\n\nWhether Persephone was abducted or absconded of her own volition is an enduring point of scholarly debate.\n\nRegardless of the circumstance of her departure, Demeter was so bereft at the loss of her child that she roamed the earth in mortal guise, forbidding anything to grow; trees were bare, fields were fallow, and hunger served as a metaphor for grief.\n\nAs the queen of bounty, she threatened to keep the earth infinitely barren and effectively starve mankind if Persephone was not returned.\n\nZeus, sending Hermes as his emissary, beseeched Hades to let the girl go. Hades agreed, but not before persuading Persephone to eat a handful of pomegranate seeds.\n\nThe gesture was a trick, as anyone who ate from the underworld was condemned to it. A deal was struck, and an agreement was made; Persephone would be permitted to leave but bound to return to the land of the dead each year.\n\nThe fall equinox marks Persephone\u2019s return/descent and reflects Demeter\u2019s grief/wrath at the cyclical loss of her daughter.\n\nHow to celebrate the fall equinox\n\nOur forebearers have long since celebrated the harvest and the waning light of the autumnal equinox through feasting and fire. You can think of the occasion as a less problematic and decidedly less genocidally rooted kind of Thanksgiving.\n\nGive me a mythic kidnapping over concrete colonization any day.\n\nTo best salute the sun\u2019s decline, I advise gathering outside to absorb the full energy of the divided day.\n\nCome night, start a bonfire if you can, and light candles if you can\u2019t.\n\nBuild an altar of apples and bread to offer gratitude for the earth\u2019s abundance. Gather those you love and those you might around a table, raise your glasses, fill your plates, and repeat the only prayer you\u2019ll ever need: \u201d Thank you, thank you, thank you.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re the sort to mourn the summer, I highly recommend reading this essay by Jeanette Winterson, which extolls the virtues of the darker seasons. It will make you want to drink red wine and eat parsnips with only your lover, and the complete works of Lord Byron for company.\n\nIt\u2019s cozy AF and an excellent primer for autumn and winter. As Winterson writes, \u201cGive the body back its seasons and the mind is saner. I believe in pleasure \u2013 but not the same pleasure all the time. Seasonal pleasure prevents boredom and cynicism.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s to welcoming seasonal pleasure and luxuriating in long nights, and what we make of them.\n\nEquinox recommendations for each sign\n\nAs fire signs, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius tend to focus on what is next rather than what is at hand, getting ahead rather than going within. In place of momentum, advance by slowing down and attuning to simple rapture. Permit yourself to take your time and to revel in what you miss at high speeds: flowers, nuance, steady breathing, subversive humor, and the constellation of freckles on a stranger.\n\nAlready anchored to the home, Earth signs, Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn are bound to spend even more time in their safe harbors come winter. The equinox is an excellent opportunity to clear out and stock up, rid yourself of clutter, and fill the pantry, bunker, escape room, etc., with pickles, preserves, dried things, live plants, and moon water.\n\nEarth signs need the outdoors, so by all means, wander barefoot whenever possible, have sex in a corn field if the feeling strikes, forage, and prepare yourselves for winter.\n\nAir signsGemini, Libra, and Aquarius are best served with a sonic realignment and a digital detox. Often in their thoughts more than in their bodies, tapping into tonal balancing courtesy of a sound bath ceremony helps them be present in and grateful for the home that is their body.\n\nThe water signs Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces can balance their tides by reflecting on the distances and depths they have traveled to and from. Meditation, writing a letter to who you used to be, and a ritual that prioritizes release and readying the soil of the self for rest and regeneration are highly recommended.\n\nAstrology 101: Your guide to the stars\n\nThe 12 zodiac signs\n\nWhat are the astrology houses\n\nHere\u2019s what each planet represents\n\nSun, moon, and rising signs: Get to know your Big 3"

People who had insomnia but increased their sleep time or utilized medication did not experience the same detriment to their cognitive health.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say for sure that treating insomnia will necessarily reduce those risks, because we lack that data \u2026 but I think there is a growing interest in that potential venue,\u201d Carvalho said.\n\nHow insomnia hurts brain health\n\nInsomnia is the most common sleep disorder Dr. Rachel Salas sees in the Johns Hopkins Center for Sleep and Wellness \u2013\u2013 and the condition involves more than just having trouble falling asleep, she said.\n\n\u201cIt can encompass problems with sleep maintenance and quality, which can affect daily functioning and overall health. Chronic insomnia is associated with an increased risk of various cognitive disorders,\u201d said Salas, professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. She was not involved in the research.\n\nGood sleep is vital for good brain health in many ways. Sleep helps clear the synapses you don\u2019t need, so that your brain isn\u2019t overloaded. Research also suggests that as the day goes on, waste accumulates in the brain that sleep helps clear out, Carvalho said.\n\nThe accumulation of some of those proteins are markers for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, he added.\n\nSleep is also essential for memory consolidation, emotional regulation and overall brain recovery, Salas said. \u201cInadequate or poor-quality sleep can lead to increased neuroinflammation and impaired synaptic plasticity, factors that contribute to cognitive decline,\u201d she added.\n\nNot enough treatment\n\nInsomnia is common, but it doesn\u2019t always get the attention it deserves.\n\nPeople older than age 65 are much more likely to have a sleep disorder, Salas said. However, older people are more likely to perceive poor sleep as a normal part of aging, Carvalho added.\n\nWhile it is true that age is associated with some changes in sleep, insomnia goes beyond that, he said. Problems with initiating sleep, maintaining it, impairments during the day, fatigue, moodiness, cognitive issues and problems thinking are not what should be expected as you get older, Carvalho said.\n\nFor many demographics, insomnia tends to be underreported by patients, under-recognized and, as a result, undertreated, he added.\n\nHow to get to sleep\n\nThe hope is that treating insomnia more will both improve people\u2019s quality of life as well as protect their brain aging as they get older, Carvalho said.\n\nFortunately, simple interventions can effectively address insomnia, he added.\n\nThe primary mode of treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, or CBTI. It\u2019s not talk therapy around previous experiences. Instead, CBTI is a set of principles, tools and guidance targeting issues that lead to or perpetuate insomnia, Carvalho said.\n\nEstablishing a consistent sleep schedule and practicing relaxation techniques before bed can be helpful, Salas said. The right environment is also important, she added.\n\n\u201cMake your room like a cave,\u201d said Dr. Cheri D. Mah, a sleep physician specializing in the sleep and performance of elite athletes, in a previous story. Mah was not involved in the research. \u201cYou want it to be really dark, quiet and cool \u2014 as well as comfortable.\u201d\n\nLimiting screen time before bed, limiting caffeine and alcohol, not spending too much time in bed while awake, and getting exercise can all help set you up for success at bedtime, Carvalho said.\n\nIf you continue to struggle with insomnia after making some behavioral changes, consult with a doctor or sleep specialist, Salas said.\n\n\u201cEveryone is looking for a single pill that improves their sleep, and it\u2019s true that some patients may need medication as well if the strategies do not work for them. But even for the patients that go into medication route, they still need to be cautious about their behaviors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe whole treatment of insomnia has to be comprehensive.\u201d"

Life beyond the covers seemed dreadful because it was chilly, vertical, and full of minor inconveniences, such as no milk in the fridge and other people. Lying down, I could simply exist. My day couldn\u2019t get off to a bad start if I refused to start it. I couldn\u2019t wake up on the wrong side of the bed if I stayed snoozing.\n\nI wanted to be the kind of person to seize the day instead of lying in bed for hours. I tried keeping my phone on the other side of the room, so I would have to get out of bed to fetch it. But I would simply retrieve it and scurry back into my warm cocoon. My flatmates were instructed to shove me out of bed \u2013 that didn\u2019t work either, I just shouted at them. Some mornings, small sips of Red Bull while I was still under the covers were the only thing that finally got me up.\n\nI\u2019ve often wondered how it got to this. Perhaps it had to do with my attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis, or that my Indian mother used to wake me up for school by wordlessly turning the big lights on and tearing the sheets off me. Or perhaps I was just lazy.\n\nBut that all changed when I found out about the 3-2-1 method. The trick is to count down out loud, quickly, and leap out of bed on \u201cone\u201d. No countdowns from 200, and you can\u2019t draw out the numbers slowly.\n\nMy mornings have been transformed. After the short shock of getting out of bed so quickly, I can now make my coffee slowly \u2013 I used to have to skip it altogether when I was in a rush. At noon, I can smugly look back on all the things I\u2019ve done that morning, even if they are as simple as reading the news thoroughly or wearing an outfit I feel confident in, rather than throwing on whatever was closest.

I\u2019m still not a morning person, but I feel much more productive.\n\nThere have been times, of course, that I\u2019ve been tempted to ignore the countdown and stay in bed.

My mother was no longer jolting me awake \u2013 so why couldn\u2019t I listen to my own voice, trust I was acting in my own best interest, and get up?\n\nI realised that the only thing I hate more than not being in bed is feeling as if I don\u2019t have any willpower.

It\u2019s described as a deep, dreamless sleep where ego, personal identity, and the outside world fade away, leaving only a pure awareness of existence.\n\nOften regarded as a state of pure bliss, it is free from grief, suffering, desire and worldly worries \u2014 with many report feelings of joy and rejuvenation upon waking.\n\nTo better understand the phenomenon, University of Edinburgh scientists turned to the internet.\n\n\u201cWe first surveyed 573 people online about unusual forms of sleep experiences,\u201d Adriana Alcaraz-Sanchez, lead author of the study, wrote in The Conversation.\n\nThen, they dug deeper with in-depth interviews of 18 participants who said they\u2019d had some form of an \u201cobjectless sleep experience\u201d in the past.\n\nAll of them reported having moments during sleep with no sensory content \u2014 just a clear feeling of knowing they were aware.\n\nSome described a faint presence in a hazy state, or an eerie awareness of \u201cnothingness\u201d or a \u201cvoid,\u201d where their sense of self seemed to vanish.\n\n\u201cAlthough objectless sleep experiences like conscious sleep have mainly been linked to contemplative practices, such as dream yoga, our results indicate that people without knowledge of those practices also experienced this phenomenon,\u201d Alcaraz-Sanchez noted.\n\nPushing the envelope, the researchers taught four volunteers a mix of meditation, visualization and lucid dreaming tricks so that they could stay aware while drifting off.\n\nOnce asleep, the participants signaled their awareness with a pre-agreed eye movement while their brains were monitored with an EEG test.\n\nThe team found these \u201cobjectless sleep experiences\u201d happen, at least part of the time, during deep, non-REM sleep.\n\n\u201cThe existence of this state pushes us to reconsider what consciousness is,\u201d Alcaraz-Sanchez wrote.\n\nShe pointed out that Western science has long pegged consciousness as awareness of an object \u2014 like your coffee cup, the color of your shoes or even your breath.\n\nBut in these rare sleep states, all those things fall away.\n\nIn the past, Alcaraz-Sanchez said sleep consciousness has mostly been studied through dreams and dream-like states \u2014 but objectless sleep experience hints at a whole new level of awareness without any content.\n\n\u201cThe fact people can be aware of \u2018nothing\u2019 while asleep might tell us more about the mind than any dream ever could,\u201d she wrote."

The scientists returned to see the snake following one cold night when temps dipped to 48.9 degrees Fahrenheit, whereupon they found the snake swimming in a swamp without a distended midsection.\n\nLying nearby was the minimally digested remains of a whitetail that it had regurgitated.\n\nAs the snakes are cold blooded, all of their functions, including digestion, slow to a crawl until the weather warms up again \u2014 similar to how Florida\u2019s invasive iguanas freeze and topple from trees during cold snaps. Should the mercury dip too low, the python\u2019s meal can start decomposing in its stomach faster than the snake can digest it, causing microbes to amass.\n\nThe snake then vomits up the meal to avoid getting infected by said bacteria. Scientists deduced that this could be a positive sign when it comes to beating back these cold-blooded killers.\n\nScientists suspected that the snake missed one of the few meals it eats a year, meaning it might not have the requisite energy to make more babies, which could help restore the number of deer.\n\nHowever, as the python survived its temp-induced purge, the critter could potentially eat another deer to make up for the missed meal, further taking a bite out of the vulnerable population.\n\nNonetheless, the development also indicates that weather limit the number of regions these scaly interlopers are able to invade.\n\n\u201cPythons have complicated biology, and we\u2019ve never really dealt with an animal like this at this scale \u2014 this large, invasive ectotherm, terrestrial,\u201d Sandfoss said.\n\nIn the interim, conservations are pulling out all the stops when comes to combating this biblical seeming plague of serpents, whose numbers have exploded over the past half-century.\n\nMeasures include state incentive programs that reward residents for capturing and killing as many pythons as possible. Over the summer, a Florida snake slayer dispatched was awarded $1,000 after dispatching a whopping 87 invasive pythons in just one month.\n\nMost recently, a water management district in Florida\u2019s Everglades deployed robot rabbits (is it robo hop?) to help monitor and eventually eliminate the scourge.\n\nThe fur-minators are designed to imitate rabbits\u2019 movements and even their heat signature and scent, which pythons hone in on when hunting flesh-and-blood bunnies.\n\nUpon spotting a snake, the decoy\u2019s artificial intelligence-powered camera alerts officials with the South Florida Water Management District, which dispatches someone to eradicate the threat.\n\nDespite the prevalent and cutting-edge measures, experts fear that the python plague is here to stay."

So when he read about the postcard in the local newspaper, he knew it was his call to action. He reached out to the reporter, saying he \u201cmay be able to help.\u201d\n\nThe LaSalle County Genealogy Guild also joined the search. Volunteers sifted through old newspaper clippings and archives, looking for mentions of \u201cRev. F.E. Ball\u201d and \u201cAlan\u201d from the time the postcard was sent. Using resources at the Reddick Public Library, they uncovered key pieces of this mystery surrounding \u201cAlan Ball.\u201d\n\nThe search eventually pointed west. It seemed \u201cAlan\u201d could be Dr. Alan Ball, now 88 and retired more than 1,700 miles away in Sandpoint, Idaho.\n\nA quick stop at the UN in New York\n\nIt had all started in 1953 when Ball took a train from Ottawa to New York, where he planned to hop a plane for Puerto Rico to spend the summer with his Aunt Mary. His family didn\u2019t have much money, so he had spent a couple of years mowing lawns and shoveling snow to save for the trip.\n\nBall was excited to \u201cexperience a different language\u201d and new customs. He described that time as \u201cbecoming an adult.\u201d He was also a little nervous \u2014 this would be his first time on a plane.\n\nWith time to spare in New York before heading to the airport, he stopped at the brand-new United Nations Secretariat Building. There, he put a two-cent stamp on a postcard of the building and mailed it to his parents to let them know, \u201cI made it as far as New York.\u201d\n\nStill at 88, Ball recalled his experiences in Puerto Rico fondly. He described the \u201cjungle in the mountains\u201d at Aunt May\u2019s coffee plantation and said the trip was a \u201ctotally new\u201d and \u201cexpanding\u201d experience for him.\n\nWhat he didn\u2019t know was that the card he had sent home never reached his parents, instead vanishing into postal limbo.\n\n\u2018Sorry it\u2019s so late\u2019\n\nThen, one day last week, Ball got a call from Tom Collins, a journalist from The Times, telling him a postcard he may have sent in 1953 had been recovered.\n\n\u201cWhen I first heard about it. I think I just started laughing,\u201d Ball said, adding it was so bizarre and unexpected.\n\nWhen the postcard finally arrived, a Sandpoint postal worker handed it to him with a smile, saying, \u201cSorry it\u2019s so late.\u201d\n\nBall chuckled as he recalled the encounter, still astonished a card he had written as a teenager had resurfaced.\n\nBy the time the postcard was officially returned to sender, it had traveled at least 2,500 miles across the country \u2014 thanks to a postmaster, reporters and a team of genealogists brought it back to him, closing the loop on a message no one knew was missing."

Viva M\u00e9xico!\u201d the consul general of Mexico in Sacramento yelled several times, reenacting the cry that ignited the fight for Mexico\u2019s independence in 1810.\n\nUnlike previous years, the ceremony commemorating Mexican Independence Day in the capital of the Golden State was brief, and organizers opted to forgo a festival that previously drew dozens of vendors and large crowds.\n\nThe celebration in Sacramento was among several honoring Mexican Independence Day and Hispanic Heritage Month that took place as planned or in scaled-down versions across the United States even as fears of immigration raids loom large in the community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s smaller but still powerful.

Activists highlight the flag's role in uniting diverse movements, emphasizing that despite cultural differences, the youth collectively demand accountability and justice from their governments.",

                "text": "In Indonesia, it was hung outside homes, on motorbikes, cars and trucks, in a sign of discontent with the government that boiled over into deadly protests railing against lavish perks enjoyed by politicians. In Nepal, it was draped on the golden gates of the palace that houses parliament, as young people toppled their government. In the Philippines, it was raised at rallies by protesters furious at alleged government corruption.\n\nThe flag, showing a cartoon skull wearing a straw hat, taken from the hugely popular Japanese anime One Piece, has become a symbol of defiance and hope for gen Z protesters across Asia.\n\nIn the 1997 anime, it is carried by a band of Straw Hat pirates that stand up to corrupt and repressive rulers. Its meaning has resonated across borders.\n\n\u201cEven though we have different languages and cultures, we speak the same language of oppression,\u201d said Eugero Vincent Liberato, 23, a recent graduate who helped organise the protests in the Philippines capital Manila. \u201cWe see the flag as a symbol of liberation against oppression \u2026 that we should always fight for the future we deserve.\u201d\n\nTens of thousands of Filipinos took to the streets on Sunday to voice their anger over allegations that officials and contractors siphoned off funds intended for much-needed flood relief projects. As protesters gathered at Manila\u2019s Luneta Park, the One Piece Jolly Roger flag could be seen fluttering above crowds.\n\n\u201cFor every peso they steal from us, they are stealing our future and the [future of] next [generations] that come after us,\u201d said Liberato. It would be an understatement to say young people are angry, he added. \u201cThey are enraged.\u201d\n\nAcross the region, pop culture has often been used by young protesters to signal defiance. In both Thailand and Myanmar, the three-finger Hunger Games salute has been used in recent years to show opposition to the military, and the fight for democracy. In 2020, Thai protesters used references to Harry Potter in protests against the monarchy, which is shielded from criticism by a severe lese majesty law.\n\nAnime, which comes from Japan and is popular across Indonesia, Nepal and the Philippines, has also proved a powerful and accessible symbol over recent weeks, spreading across social media.\n\nOne Piece, by Eiichiro Oda, holds the record for the most copies published in the same comic book series by a single author, with 500m copies printed worldwide. It has been adapted into a live-action Netflix series, as well as animated movies and a card game.\n\nThe One Piece flag was used widely by protesters in Indonesia last month ahead of the country\u2019s Independence Day on 17 August, irking officials. One lawmaker said it was an attempt to divide national unity, another suggested displaying it could amount to treason.\n\nA series of reports stating that people had been targeted by the police and military after showing the flag prompted Amnesty International to issue a statement warning that such actions were a violation of people\u2019s freedom of expression.\n\nAnalysts have noted that such a defensive response risks only fuelling the power of such symbols, which spread organically online and are popular because they are light and familiar.\n\nYoung people have drawn not only on pop culture, but also biting wit. Philippine news website Rappler noted the \u201csardonic humour\u201d displayed by young protesters at rallies where signs were held that said: \u201cWe\u2019re not fish, but why we live in water?\u201d, referencing the flood funding scandal.\n\n\u201cYouth are very creative in terms of organising and they have so many fresh ideas,\u201d said Ruben Gabas, 20, a full-time activist in Manila.\n\nWhile the specific demands to protests differ across the region, the underlying messages echo one another and symbols such as One Piece transcend borders, say activists. \u201cWe all share the same struggle, that is to have a livable future,\u201d said Liberato."

                "text": "You've probably seen spotted lanternflies all around Maryland and Baltimore. They are tan and covered in black spots.\n\nWhen they open their wings, a bright red flashes in front of you.\n\nSpotted lanternflies are an invasive species in Maryland, and although they will not harm you, they are threatening our ecosystem and farms.\n\nWhat are they and how did they get here?\n\nExperts believe the spotted lanternfly came over from China on a stone shipment to Berks County, Pennsylvania, in 2014. They then entered Maryland in 2018.\n\nMegan Carr, a Forest Ecologist with Baltimore City Recreation and Parks' Forestry Division, said they were first found in Baltimore in 2021.\n\nThey are an invasive hopper insect that suck sap from grapevines and trees, including the weeping willow, maples, and black walnuts.\n\nJessica Boyles, an Environmental specialist and coordinator for the spotted lanternfly program at the Maryland Department of Agriculture, said you've probably seen what the adult looks like.\n\n\"Usually you see the pictures with the splayed wings, where you see the red underneath, and they've got those black dots on the forewings with the brown,\" Boyles said. \"That's pretty typical. We also have fourth instars, which are right before adults. The fourth instars are rather small; people mistake them for spiders most of the time because they're so low. They're red and black and white.\" The youngest ones are just black and white.\n\nThe insect will lay their eggs in the fall. The egg masses have been described as grey-white and look like mud or clay on a tree. Those eggs will hatch in April or June.\n\nWhere do you see them?\n\nIn short, everywhere.\n\nTheir preferred tree host is the Tree of Heaven, which is invasive itself. It first came over as a landscaping tree because it provides good shade and beautiful flowers.\n\nBoyles said the Maryland Department of Agriculture does a lot of management for vineyards and high-transportation pathways.\n\nThe Tree of Heaven grows in disturbed environments, like where roads and trains are built.\n\n\"We get a lot of reports of people going to Marc stations and seeing a ton of Spotted Lanternfly,\" Boyles said.\n\nHow are they harmful?\n\n\"The good news to people is that it's not harmful to humans, but it definitely has some impacts on our local ecosystems,\" Carr said.\n\nBut she also said they rarely kill trees, and our forests aren't losing canopy from them.\n\nThey hop around a lot and can be startling, but they do not bite or sting. However, they can attract others who do.\n\n\"My biggest concern about spotted lanternflies in a home landscape is that the honeydew will attract vast numbers of stinging insects,\" said Michael Raupp, a former professor of entomology at the University of Maryland. \"Yellow jackets, paper wasps, hornets, honeybees, this poses a risk to humans and pets in those landscapes.\"\n\nBoyles said it's the secondary issues that can harm the trees. Since the bugs eat sap, they are creating wounds in the trees, which can open them to other pests and diseases.\n\nSpotted lanternflies also excrete honeydew, which is just sugar and water. However, when it sits on vegetation, it creates sooty mold. \"And that sooty mold stops photosynthesis,\" Boyles said. \"Or it decreases the ability for that plant to photosynthesize.\"\n\nThe sooty mold can also get on your outdoor furniture and cars and cause a mess that's hard to get rid of.\n\n\"The No. 1 complaint I get is that it reduced people's quality of life, \" Boyles said. \"Because they feel like they can't enjoy their backyard.\"\n\nBoyles doesn't have an answer on how to clean it up.\n\n\"I've heard some people say that if they took regular cleaning products to their grills and porches, they are able to get it up; sometimes it stains, but they are able to get it up. It's not a good solution,\" Boyles said.\n\nThe bugs can also deter people from getting outside and enjoying nature and the city's forests.\n\n\"For us, our main issue is that they're really just kind of gross,\" Carr said. \"You see all these bugs moving around, some people are afraid of them. And sometimes you'll have the honeydew actually raining down on you. And those can be issues.\"\n\nImpact on vineyards\n\nAll the experts that WJZ spoke to about the spotted lanternfly seem to agree that one of the biggest threats of the insect is to vineyards and grapes.\n\n\"When spotted lanternflies are able to feed on them, they reduce their ability to overwinter, deplete nitrogen, and they can reduce the ability for the vines to grow profitable grapes the following year, sometimes they're really sickly,\" Boyles said. \"They can stunt the growth of young vines, so it's an awful, awful sentence for vineyards.\"\n\nEdward Boyce and his wife planted the first grapes at Black Ankle Vineyards in Mount Airy in 2003.\n\nFarming can always come with unforeseen challenges, but Ed says on average, they are probably down about 60% in their harvest so far this year. And the bugs are a big part of it.\n\n\"We've been through multi-colored Asian Lady Beetles, been through stink bugs, been through a couple other invasive insect pests,\" Boyce said. \"Eventually, you deal with them. That's farming. This is the worst. By far.\"\n\nBoyce said the invasive bugs tend to go to the edges of his field. That's because they aren't the best flyers, but tend to hop to nearby plants.\n\n\"The middle is down maybe 40-50% but the edges are literally nothing,\" Boyce said about his grape production this year.\n\nAnd nature is not helping much.\n\nBoyce has seen some yellow jackets attack them, but not much else.\n\n\"The only thing I've actually seen eat them is my cat. Who just whacked one out of the air. Who looked at it and gobbled it right up,\" Boyce said. \"But there's a few too many for my cat to eat them all.\"\n\nTo try to mitigate the problem, Black Ankle Vineyards knocked down the Tree of Heaven they had around their property. They also work with the Maryland Department of Agriculture.\n\nAnd, they scrape off egg masses when they see them.\n\nBut when the bugs start killing the vines, they have to start spraying insecticide, which he does not like to do.\n\n\"That's really frustrating because we worked so hard to build a good balance in the vineyard between the good, bad, and the bad bugs,\" Boyce said. \"And the good bugs keep the bad bugs in balance and to a dull roar, and everyone's happy. Then something like this happens, and it throws the whole balance off. And it's a lot of work and a long time to get it back.\"\n\nBoyce said they usually harvest about 200 tons of grapes, but he thinks it will only be about a hundred or so this year. He believes it's mostly due to the bugs.\n\nEventually, he said it will impact their profits.\n\n\"We have wine down here stored from the last couple of years. This just means we will have less in the future, and we are gonna run out, and I don't know what we're going to do from there,\" Boyce said. \"But that's tomorrow's problem. Today is just how much we can save with what we have.\"\n\nFor the wine-loving consumer, Ed said his prices will not go up because of the competition.\n\n\"It's a very local phenomenon,\" Boyce said. \"If there were a market for Maryland wine, then yeah, prices would go up. But we are competing with wine from France, California, Washington state, Chile, and wherever else. And they don't have this problem.\"\n\nBut looking at the bright side, the wine they do harvest could taste better.\n\n\"We may only have last or less of our normal harvest, but if we keep getting decent weather the next few weeks, we may make some really good wine, and that might compensate a little bit for it, with really good quality,\" Boyce said.\n\nBoyce remains optimistic.\n\n\"If I've been good about keeping on these things, then yes, next year's looking better,\" he said. \"Just know we are all trying to deal with it the best we can. And help us by buying local.\"\n\nFixing Maryland's spotted lanternfly problem\n\nThe Maryland Department of Agriculture has its own program to tackle the problem of Spotted Lanternflies. They work with other organizations to help provide treatment and reduce spread, and that does include insecticides, but that's not all.\n\n\"We also conduct mechanical treatments, so without the use of chemicals,\" said Boyles, who runs the Spotted Lanternfly Team at the Department of Agriculture. Her team uses backpack vacuums.\n\nThey also do a lot of research on treatments to give to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Although, because of federal spending cuts, the Spotted Lanternfly team was cut in half. But sitting on the department's property in Annapolis, you can see the research in progress. A few weeks after conducting a systemic treatment on a tree, you could see it was already working, as lanternflies littered the ground. However, the systemic treatment lives inside the tree and the department is very strict about using it.\n\n\"We are very specific on when we do it, how we do it, and on what trees we do it on,\" said Boyles. \"It's a really harsh chemical product that Maryland citizens cannot purchase.\"\n\nSo while research is being done to combat the problem, what can the average Marylander do in the meantime? They may be pretty, but if you see them, kill them. However, stomping on them will not entirely solve the problem, according to Michael Raupp, a former professor of entomology and self-proclaimed 'bug guy.'\n\n\"If it makes you feel better, retribution, well, sure. Go ahead and squash as many as you'd like if you'd like to,\" Raupp said, \"But please understand that that's not what drives the rise and fall of spotted lanternfly populations.\"\n\nIt will help if residents get rid of any Tree of Heaven on their property, as it's the bugs' preferred host and is invasive itself. They can also scrape off any egg masses on trees or posts. The egg masses look like a little dab of clay and are whitish grey. No expensive tools are needed.\n\n\"A lot of time I will go with a little putty knife, or even something like old credit cards,\" Carr, a forester with the Baltimore Parks and Recreation Department, said. \"If you can scrape that egg mass away, then that's actually taking care of 30-40 spotted lanternflies for next year.\"\n\nResidents can also make their own traps. Boyles and Carr both said they do not prefer sticky tape traps because other animals can get trapped in them, including small birds. They suggest making a circle trap, which do not harm other animals, are successful in trapping the Spotted Lanternflies, and are cheap. All you need is mesh, paint sticks, the tops of some milk cartons, a zip-lock bag, and something to tie it to the tree. Carr said she could make three or four traps with just $8.\n\n\"As the lanternflies crawl up and down the tree trunk, you know, they're not the smartest insect,\" Carr said, \"So they will start making their way up. And the screening funnels them into your milk jug lids, and then into a zip lock baggy, or you can use a jar, basically anything you can fit over the top that you can collect them when they come in.\"\n\nCarr suggests following the instructions on how to build circle traps from the Penn State Extension website.\n\nReport Spotted Lanternflies on the Maryland Department of Agriculture's Website here.\n\nWhile the department hopes to help reduce the number over the next few years, it is unlikely the species will be eradicated completely."

The alien-looking creature was only confirmed to be a new species in 2011, 90 years after the last new jellyfish was documented.\n\n\u201cThis is about the time when you start seeing them show up,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the late summer and early fall, the pink meanies move off Texas\u2019 Gulf Coast to prey on moon jellyfish, which are among the most common jellyfish found in the region, Tunnel explained.\n\nAs the moon jellies follow the current slurping up plankton, the much larger meanies ensnare them with their far-reaching \u201coral arms\u201d that horrifyingly secrete digestive juices to break the prey down, according to Chron.\n\nThe pink meanies don\u2019t typically live for very long without a reliable food source and are sensitive to environmental changes.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no moon jellies, they die off real quick. If the water gets cold, they die off real quick. So to be able to see them is pretty rare,\u201d Tunnell told the outlet.\n\nDespite their scary name and massive size, their stings are mild to humans.\n\nTunnel rated the pain a \u201ctwo out of 10.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could use vinegar to try to remove some of the tentacles off of you and remove some of the sting,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that they are definitely not fit for humans to eat, and once they wash up on the shore they typically evaporate or get eaten by birds quickly.\n\nThe pink meanies were first spotted in the Gulf by scientists in 2000 \u2014 but were originally believed to be another species known in the Mediterranean Sea, according to Chron.\n\nFurther study confirmed that were in fact a never-before-known type of jellyfish and have since been recorded in the Mediterranean and off of South Africa."

However, they had a hand in it because they could have helped. They could have come out, checked on my children, but instead there are literally no reports, there\u2019s no paperwork whatsoever that any of those calls were made.\u201d\n\nShe has only seen her two boys once in the last year, at a reunification therapy session.\n\n\u201cThe entire time, they talked to myself and the therapist about wanting to come home, about being scared of their father, about the abuse that had happened,\" said McGarrah. \"They just get ignored.

While they have courted the most controversy, the images are actually of exaggerated, limited edition versions of the sneakers that Balenciaga is selling.\n\nAccording to the fashion house, only 100 pairs of \u201cextra destroyed\u201d sneakers will be available to buy for $1,850. Meanwhile, the non-limited edition, and less roughed up versions, are being sold on the Balenciaga website for $495 and $625, depending on the specific style.\n\nIn a press release, the Paris-based brand said that the campaign photos show the shoes \u201cextremely worn, marked up, and dirtied.\u201d\n\nIt said the still-life portraits \u201csuggest that Paris Sneaker are meant to be worn for a lifetime\u201d \u2013 a point that feels especially relevant amid growing conversations around the fast fashion industry and the impact of overconsumption on the planet.\n\nDemna is known for his disruptive flair and the Paris sneaker launch isn\u2019t the first time his designs have been met with bemused reactions.\n\nIn 2017, Balenciaga brought out a bag that cost $2,145 which was ridiculed for its similarities to Ikea\u2019s \u201cFrakta\u201d bag.

Demna (Balenciaga\u2019s creative director) will make people who can afford luxury items purchase \u2018pre-worn\u2019 looking sneakers for 1450\u20ac.

Either way, Demna and Balenciaga have once again got people talking, no doubt drawing many to a brand that seems increasingly comfortable with controversy.\n\nTop image: Campaign imagery of the Paris sneaker by Balenciaga."

Comped rooms, but $62 a night for resort fees? One-hundred dollars for a family of five to eat lunch?? Seven dollars for a Sprite?? Slot machines that don\u2019t pay out anything!

She was at that time already \u201cindie-poetry royalty\u201d, in the phrase of the New York Times, thanks to her first collection of poems, Balloon Pop Outlaw Black, and was celebrated too for her \u201csexts\u201d on Twitter. (Here are three, from 2011-13: \u201cSext: Botany Class. I do leaf rubbing after leaf rubbing until the teacher kicks me out for Moaning too much\u201d; \u201cSext: I am a water glass at the Inquisition. You are a dry pope mouth. You pucker; I wet you\u201d; \u201cSext: I am a Dan Brown novel and you do me in my plot-hole. \u2018Wow,\u2019 I yell in ecstasy, \u2018this makes no sense at all\u2019\u201d.) Called, perhaps too often, the poet laureate of Twitter, she drily notes in Priestdaddy that it took the social-media commotion attendant on \u201cRape Joke\u201d for mainstream publishers to come calling: the poem was the centrepiece of Motherland Fatherland Homelandsexuals, her second collection, which showcased what the Atlantic magazine has described as her \u201cwitty, sexually slippery, polymorphous and Millennially mischievous\u201d work.\n\nThe writing of a memoir was prompted by Lockwood\u2019s return, complete with husband and cat, and after 12 years away, to live with her parents, \u201cpenniless, exhausted\u201d. Jason was an editor on a small newspaper, who believed he was \u201cdestined to be a sort of Leonard Woolf figure\u201d; the couple accepted their \u201cpinched circumstances\u201d. When Jason developed a rare eye condition, and they had to raise $10,000 for treatment, Lockwood appealed to her Twitter followers and the money was collected within a day. But the operation went wrong; Jason needed further procedures, and could no longer work. Their only option was a room in the rectory (a sign outside the house reads \u201cGod answers knee-mail\u201d). During their nine-month stay, Lockwood finds herself \u201cjotting down everything everyone says, as fast and free as it comes out of their mouths\u201d. Her mother rises \u201cto heights of quotability exceeded only by Confucius, Muhammad Ali\u201d; her father shouts at the TV \u201cI like Chunky Soup \u2026 oh yeah\u201d.\n\nThe New Yorker has described Lockwood as \u201can exemplar of brilliant silliness\u201d, and Priestdaddy is indeed brilliantly silly, with much comedy squeezed out of her Catholic upbringing. (Rumours of Satanists are rife, and new religious robes incite the comment: \u201cThe embroidery! Do you see the detail on those lambs!\u201d) But the book strikes other notes. It would have been impossible not to address the church\u2019s record on child sexual abuse, especially when \u201cthe topic of which priests had been removed from their parishes \u2026 was discussed over the dinner table\u201d; the \u201ccode of silence\u201d exerted a great power. She reveals that, as a 16-year-old, she took 100 painkiller tablets and had to have her stomach pumped (\u201cSex would probably have helped,\u201d she says of her teenage angst, \u201cbut the only thing I was having sex with then was the intolerable sadness of the human condition, which sucked so much in bed\u201d). Between the jokes, there is a fleeting mention of her \u201cchildlessness\u201d.\n\nLockwood\u2019s father was an atheist when he married her mother. He converted when he was working as a naval seaman, serving on a nuclear submarine, and the family legend is that it was due to multiple underwater screenings of The Exorcist: \u201cthat eerie, pea-soup light was pouring down, and all around him men in sailor suits were getting the bejesus scared out of them, and the bejesus flew into my father like a dart into a bull\u2019s eye\u201d. Gregory Lockwood dubbed it \u201cthe deepest conversion on record\u201d. He became a Lutheran pastor, but later presented himself for ordination as a married Catholic priest, which required a special dispensation from the pope. In due time, he made his terrorised children watch The Exorcist as a \u201ctender rite of passage\u201d: \u201cMy father attempted to mute the line \u2018Your mother sucks cocks in hell!\u2019 but hit the wrong button on the remote and actually ended up blasting it at maximum volume.\u201d\n\nLockwood grew up with pro-life bumper stickers on the family car; she was taken by her parents to anti-abortion rallies. During her early teenage years, she attended a religious youth group called God\u2019s Gang, where they spoke in tongues, were told in detail about the sex they shouldn\u2019t have, and sang such refrains as \u201cHe\u2019s a peach of a saviour /He\u2019s the apple of my eyes \u2026 And that\u2019s why I\u2019m bananas for the Lord!\u201d She carried a card inscribed with the virginity pledge \u201cTrue Love Waits\u201d, and didn\u2019t disclose that she had already lost her hymen (she called it her \u201cherman\u201d) when she hit the water after jumping off a high diving board: \u201cSuddenly I felt romantic towards the aqua-blue water. I scissored through it in languid strokes and pictured the baby we might make together.\u201d\n\nPriestdaddy is a haphazard coming-of-age story, but also an account of a writer forming a highly individual worldview, and finding an audience. Lockwood describes the composing of \u201cRape Joke\u201d \u2013 \u201cIt came all at once \u2026 Beads along a razor blade, but now I controlled the cut\u201d. The poem recalls an incident from her late teens: \u201cThe rape joke is that you were 19 years old. / The rape joke is that he was your boyfriend. / The rape joke it wore a goatee. A goatee.\u201d Having been told about the rape, her priestdaddy made the sign of the cross over her head and absolved her of her sins. Lockwood\u2019s poems often explore the objectification of, and violence against, women. In this memoir, which depicts her charismatic, dominating father with no malice, she notes: \u201cI know all women are supposed to be strong enough now to strangle presidents and patriarchies between their powerful thighs, but it doesn\u2019t work that way. Many of us were actually affected, by male systems and male anger, in ways we cannot always articulate or overcome.\u201d\n\nIn the section entitled \u201cThe Cum Queens of Hyatt Place\u201d, Lockwood recounts a trip she makes with her mother, who, on arriving for the first time in a hotel room, finds semen stains on the sheets: \u201cThis is a Catholic\u2019s worst nightmare, souls all over the bed.\u201d They wonder who was responsible. \u201cI think it was probably a businessman,\u201d Lockwood remarks, \u201cwith a hotel fetish, who shouted the word \u2018amenities!\u2019 as he came.\u201d Her mother responds, without a pause: \u201cA jizzness man, you mean.\u201d Karen Lockwood, it turns out, understands \u201cPun Lightning, that jolt of connection\u201d, and Priestdaddy becomes in one sense a tribute to her, both as an endless resource of love and care, and an intellectual kindred spirit.\n\nAt the end of the book, Patricia and Jason have moved out of the rectory, and everything is more possible, less desperate. On a cherished holiday in Key West, Florida, Lockwood looks back, in a fine sentence, to previous stays there: \u201cNext to the sea we were submerged, and what we said in the middle of the night did not matter, it was just breathing \u2026 silvery bubbles that wobbled up through the depths.\u201d But family remains closer than it was, and on this vacation her mother is with them, liberated for a while from her crazed home and husband. Happy and full of champagne, she drunkenly proclaims \u2013 as her daughter undoubtedly would \u2013 \u201cI love language\u201d."

                "text": "DEAR ABBY: I met \u201cDonny\u201d 18 months ago. For a while, we were both happy. Then suddenly, every Friday, Donny would make some excuse, smoke a cigarette, and go to the bar across the street. Afterward, he would show up here drunk, and we would argue. When Donny was sober, he was a great guy, but every weekend he disappeared. Although I tried every day to help him, the drinking evolved into drugs.\n\nA few months ago, he came over to visit. He started acting \u201coff\u201d and went into my bathroom. A short time later, I found him kneeling on the floor. It looked like he had taken something. The next morning, when I went to wake him up, Donny had died! I called 911 and tried CPR.\n\nThere was nothing they could do. He had overdosed. I\u2019m now living with guilt. If only I had tried to wake him earlier, maybe he could have been saved. I\u2019m taking medication, but I am stuck. I stay home most of the time. I want to move forward, but can\u2019t seem to do it. Any advice? \u2014 STUCK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nDEAR STUCK: You have nothing to feel guilty about. Donny didn\u2019t die because of anything you did or didn\u2019t do. His dealer gave him a drug that was more powerful than he could tolerate, and he took it. In fact, if you hadn\u2019t invited him in, he probably would have died on the street somewhere.\n\nBecause you cannot move past the guilt you have inflicted upon yourself, and the medication you are taking isn\u2019t doing the job, start talking with a mental health professional who can help you through this. You have my sympathy for the loss of someone you loved.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My mother-in-law drives me bonkers. It started when our son (her only grandchild) was born. She is obsessed with him. We live in different states, and during our most recent visit there, she kept pressuring my son to come back on his own for two or three weeks.\n\nShe constantly voices her opinions loudly in his presence, whether they are about schools we are considering, extracurricular activities, etc., and she is nasty about things she doesn\u2019t agree with. She also interrupts everyone and has no interest in anything that may be important to others if it doesn\u2019t have an impact on her.\n\nAn example: I was asked to lead a local nonprofit organization. She promptly sneered about the organization, offering not one word of support.\n\nI would be happy to never see her again while still encouraging my son to have a relationship with her. However, he\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t want to visit her without me and his dad, so it\u2019s not us saying no.\n\nMy husband (her only child) tries his best, but she\u2019s his mom, and he\u2019s caught in the middle. Have you any idea how to handle this difficult relationship? \u2014 NEEDLED IN CONNECTICUT\n\nDEAR NEEDLED: No law states that you must send your son to visit your husband\u2019s mother if he doesn\u2019t want to go. Because your husband isn\u2019t strong enough to be the \u201cbad guy,\u201d it will be up to you to tell her that your son (I assume he\u2019s still quite young and can\u2019t speak for himself) will not be visiting unless it is part of a family unit.\n\nWhen she gives you an argument (and she probably will), be polite and stand firm.\n\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

                "text": "There are six new turnkey Brooklyn brownstones \u2014 but they\u2019re not for sale. That\u2019s because they\u2019re located in the bowels of Barclays Center.\n\nThe custom paint just dried on the arena\u2019s gut renovation of its six artist dressing rooms, Laurie Jacoby, the chief entertainment officer at BSE Global, exclusively told The Post. All 2,200 square feet were redesigned to evoke the look of brownstones, from thick crown molding to pocket doors.\n\nThe project is just a slice of the Barclays\u2019 $100 million, multi-year facelift.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really want to hold back,\u201d said Jacoby.\n\nMonths of work by designers and artisans transformed the six interconnected dressing rooms into a cozy warren worthy of a Park Slope brownstone. The once-gray walls and drab black chairs were replaced by golden sconces and velvet love seats; vintage-inspired lighting and custom millwork now line freshly limewashed walls.\n\nThe redesign gives a sense of place for artists who might otherwise only glimpse the borough from a tour bus window, Jacoby said. Each room bears the name of an iconic Brooklyn neighborhood, with corresponding paint colors \u2014 rich army green for Fort Greene and a brick red for Brooklyn Heights.\n\nThere\u2019s even a \u201cvestibule\u201d that fronts the dressing rooms, featuring checkered marble floors, frosted glass and a golden chandelier.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in an arena when you come in,\u201d Jacoby said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of what we wanted to achieve, you can leave the world outside for a little bit, you come in here and have a little respite.\u201d\n\nA few acts have already had the chance to enjoy the homey interiors, including the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, Puerto Rican rapper Eladio Carri\u00f3n and country singer Eric Church. Reactions have been positive, Jacoby said.\n\nApplying a brownstone aesthetic to a 13-year-old arena\u2019s basement dressing rooms was no small task. The Brooklyn Home Company, the designers charged with transformation, faced a bare-bones space that hadn\u2019t been renovated since Barclays opened its doors in 2012.\n\nLike any good facelift, dressing room\u2019s \u201cbefore\u201d photos are unrecognizable \u2014 the former aesthetic was more far more DMV than VIP.\n\nThe bland rooms featured gray walls, swinging metal doors, fluorescent lights and plain-looking black leather seating. It was high time for an overhaul of the space, which Jacoby compared to an airport lobby.\n\n\u201cArtists need a home. And this didn\u2019t feel like a home,\u201d Jacoby said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of how it started. And what is Brooklyn known for? Its beautiful brownstones.\u201d\n\nRound any number of residential streets from Bed-Stuy to Boerum Hill, and you\u2019ll see what she means. Brooklyn\u2019s iconic 19th and early-20th century townhouses, characterized by their reddish-brown sandstone facades, symbolize a uniquely Brooklyn brand of home-y luxury available to the lucky few.\n\nTheir distinctive high stoops, opulent entrances and interior craftsmanship often earn the best-located brownstones tens of millions of dollars on the open market.\n\nThe decor pays homage to the area, too, including furniture sourced along Atlantic Avenue and coffee table books by hometown heroes like Spike Lee.\n\nThe $100 million modernization isn\u2019t just about looking like the borough that Barclays calls home \u2014 the 19,000-seat arena has to compete with larger venues like Madison Square Garden for performing acts and their loyal fans.\n\nThe fresh dressing room is just one part of ensuring Barclays stays top of mind for top talent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive marketplace,\u201d Jacoby said. \u201cI want Brooklyn to stand out.\u201d\n\nThe dressing rooms, now seamlessly connected by pocket doors, can meet the demands acts big and small, with a 56-person capacity for glam squads, management teams and meet-and-greets.\n\nSuch lush digs beg the question \u2013 how will the custom marble countertops and sculptural side-tables fare against hard-partying musicians? When the tell-all memoir of every other musical legend comes with tales of trashed dressing rooms, such lush furnishings might be a risky investment. Jacoby isn\u2019t too concerned.\n\n\u201cI think people respect a beautiful environment and want to keep it that way,\u201d she said.\n\nThe constraints of space and the hectic arena environment meant that the dressing rooms couldn\u2019t get the full luxury market treatment \u2013 accessible showers and mini fridges take the place of clawfoot tubs and Gaggenau appliances.\n\nThe cost of the dressing-room renovation, which Jacoby declined to disclose, is included in the overall $100 million budget that is reshaping the arena. The facelift comes with a targeted end date of 2027 or 2028, she said.\n\nAnd, especially considering these new dressing rooms, it\u2019s all worth every cent.\n\n\u201cI think people were completely blown away,\u201d she said. \u201cI am anxious to have somebody see it who was here before. They won\u2019t think they\u2019re in the same building.\u201d"

                "text": "A notoriously dangerous Central Park thoroughfare for pedestrians and joggers has become even more treacherous \u2014 after a redesign that was supposed to make it safer, locals say.\n\nThe revamped 6-mile loop debuted in June with just a single two-way lane for pedestrians while creating two new one-way lanes for slow and fast-moving bikes \u2014 amid fewer walk signals, confusing new signage and still-ignored cyclist traffic lights, critics claim.\n\n\u201cCrossing any street in Central Park is like running the gauntlet, the lights don\u2019t matter,\u201d park-goer Lester Gottesman griped to The Post along West Drive at the southern end of the park.\n\n\u201cOccasionally, pedal bikes will stop, or horse and buggies will stop, [but] e-bikes, forget it,\u201d the 73-year-old surgeon said.\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be allowed: I\u2019ve taken care of enough people run over by e-bikes.\u201d\n\nThe stretch previously had one walking lane, a bike lane and one or two vehicle paths depending on the point along the drive.\n\nA city Transportation Department rep insisted to The Post, \u201cThe Central Park Drives redesign is an ongoing project to reimagine the park loop as a more functional and accessible public space for New Yorkers and visitors.\n\n\u201cShaped by a study and public feedback, the project emphasizes safety by expanding designated space for pedestrians and cyclists with clearer separation between those areas to reduce conflicts.\u201d\n\nBut a recent visit from The Post to the area witnessed multiple near-accidents between pedestrians and zipping cyclists swerving between lanes.\n\nHorse carriage operator and union spokesperson Christina Hansen described a \u201chighway\u201d scene of deliveristas racing north from Midtown during lunch and dinnertime.\n\nBut City Hall slammed Hansen\u2019s remarks as \u201cshameful\u201d and blasted the union for \u201cscapegoating another workforce \u2014 including their own members \u2014 to distract from video evidence of high-profile, dangerous horse-carriage accidents.\n\n\u201cThis redesign of the Central Park Drive will bring more order to the beloved loop for pedestrians and cyclists, but the [union] would rather you turn the other cheek as horse carriages dangerously run rampant,\u201d a City Hall rep added.\n\nSince June, 25 crashes have been reported in the park, according to CrashMapper, including an incident that claimed the life of an e-bike rider when he hit a pedestrian.\n\nBy comparison, 12 crashes were reported during the same time period in 2024 without any fatalities.\n\n\u201cNo one stops here: Even with the walk signal, the bikes don\u2019t stop,\u201d said a park-goer who only identified himself as Tom.\n\n\u201cThe bikes think they own the park.\u201d\n\nThe redesign was undertaken after a study from the Central Park Conservancy published last fall. Its resulting plan aimed to \u201cprioritize pedestrian safety while also better accommodating cyclists and legal e-mobility options.\u201d\n\nA conservancy rep said, \u201cEveryone should feel safe walking, jogging or riding in the park.\n\n\u201cWe share profound concerns related to high speeds on the Drives \u2014 especially by e-scooters, e-bikes and non-electric racing bikes,\u201d adding that NYPD is responsible for enforcing the drive\u2019s 20-mph speed limit.\n\nBut Hansen, who works in the park, said police are scarce across its 843 acres (1.3 square miles) \u2014 and that the redesign has been such a pain in the neck that her horse carriage union thinks it was done on purpose to drive the buggies out.\n\n\u201cCollisions have increased, I\u2019ve seen lots of near-misses that I didn\u2019t see before,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have already gotten hurt. \u2026 And ambulances, police vehicles and garbage trucks can\u2019t get around.\u201d\n\nThe unpopular redesign is not only dangerous but unlawful, according to New York E-Vehicle Safety Alliance president Janet Schroeder.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is against all [Americans with Disabilities Act] regulations,\u201d Schroeder said of the removal of pedestrian walk signals in the park, especially for those who are low-vision or blind. \u201cIt\u2019s very ageist and ableist.\n\n\u201cOlder people with disabilities, where can they go for walks anymore?\u201d\n\nA DOT rep said the redesign is an ongoing project and that the agency is actively monitoring the project and will make adjustments as needed.\n\nBut Schroeder said that in the meantime, the speeding problem is only getting worse while elderly and disabled parkgoers are driven out of the green space in fear.\n\n\u201cIt does not solve e-bikes on pedestrian walkways or solve the problem of speeding,\u201d she said of the revamp. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve any of the issues we had in the park.\u201d"

                "text": "In the old photo studios of Lagos, Nigeria, negatives were being burned. No longer needed or wanted, they were too difficult to store, the subjects had moved on or died, and the photo labs that printed them had long since shuttered.\n\nThose that were not discarded or set alight were left to degrade in rice bags and cardboard boxes, the humid Lagos air slowly destroying the emulsion.\n\nWhen Karl Ohiri, a British Nigerian artist, first heard about this, he was shocked.\n\n\u201cI was witnessing this history that was on the verge of being destroyed,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nThese analog photographers captured life in Lagos from the 1960s to the early 2000s.\n\nFrom black and white portraits of young men in their bell bottoms, to a woman praying in front of a backdrop of the Islamic holy city of Mecca, to color photos of people showing off their new cassette players, the images these photographers made were a glimpse into Nigeria\u2019s biggest city before the advent of digital photography.\n\nHowever, they had never been digitized or archived \u2014 there were no backups.\n\nIn countries like the UK, Ohiri said, museums might have taken the photos, adding them to their vast archives; London\u2019s V&A Museum has 800,000 photos in its collection and the National Portrait Gallery has 250,000.\n\nBut in Lagos, Ohiri explained, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t anywhere to house them.\u201d\n\nOhiri and his partner Riikka Kassinen launched Lagos Studio Archives to save the collections. They have spent the last nine years hunting down studios and photographers, cataloguing their archives, and creating exhibitions of the work.\n\nIt has not always been easy. \u201cLagos moves fast,\u201d Kassinen explained; many of the photographers have since died, their studios torn down and new developments built in their place. There is sometimes so little trace of the studios that \u201cit\u2019s almost like (they) never happened,\u201d said Ohiri.\n\nEven if the pair could find the photographers, sometimes they were too late. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to some photographers who had three or four decades of work that doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d Ohiri said. \u201cAll of that history and heritage and there\u2019s nothing left\u2026 it takes all of that time to amass, and just half a second to put some kerosene on it and light it up and that\u2019s it. Just gone.\u201d\n\nInitially, many of the photographers did not understand their interest. \u201cThey just thought we were crazy,\u201d Ohiri said. Now they have the work of at least 25 photographers in the archive, though they cannot be sure of an exact number as some of the troves they were given contained multiple photographers\u2019 work.\n\nNor do they know how many negatives are in the collection, only that it is in the hundreds of thousands, piling up in Ohiri and Kassinen\u2019s studio in Helsinki, Finland. \u201cWe might not be able to (digitize) everything in our lifetimes,\u201d Ohiri conceded.\n\nTheater of dreams\n\nThe \u201970s was a period of rapid change in Nigeria. The country\u2019s civil war had ended, Nigerian oil had boomed, and an increasingly urban population was enraptured by Fela Kuti\u2019s Afrobeat. Photo studios became a place for people to document their everyday lives, show off their accomplishments and celebrate events. \u201cIt was a theater of dreams where people could really show their aspirations,\u201d Ohiri said.\n\nIn the midst of these social and cultural changes sweeping through Lagos was Abi Morocco Photos.\n\nMade up of husband-and-wife photographers John, who died in 2024, and Funmilayo Abe, Abi Morocco Photos worked from the early 1970s to 2006. First from a studio on Aina Street, and later moving, the pair took portraits at the studio, as well as visiting customers\u2019 homes, attending events and ceremonies, and shooting portraits in the streets.\n\nOhiri and Kassinen recently curated an exhibition of the Abes\u2019 work from the 1970s at the Autograph gallery in London, and have plans for a photobook of the couple\u2019s work.\n\nThe show followed the archive\u2019s inclusion in the New Photography Exhibition at New York\u2019s MoMA, in 2023. \u201cArchive of Becoming\u201d was an experimental series of images, culled from damaged negatives. Ohiri and Kassinen had to wear masks to protect them from the fumes and mold that had grown on the discarded negatives as they painstakingly preserved them.\n\nNow the archive is planning a project on female photographers and they want to make the overall collection accessible to citizens of the megacity through books and exhibitions.\n\nDespite exhibiting the work around the world, the pair have never met any of the paying clients \u2014 the closest they have gotten is a friend who recognized their uncle in one of the pictures. They hope that people might one day recognize the scratched black and white portraits, the mold-stained faces, and time-faded colors, so that the thousands of negatives can become not just a document of the city, but \u201ca family archive of Lagos.\u201d"

                "text": "As a seven-year-old, covered head to toe with only her eyes and nose exposed, Dilmer Briche Gonz\u00e1lez used to pick the long, fat fruits from the cacao tree and place them in a big pile. \u201cImagine a forest where giant mosquitoes abound,\u201d Briche Gonz\u00e1lez, now 53, recalls of her childhood on her family\u2019s ancestral farm.\n\nHer grandfather, uncle and grandmother would cut each cacao fruit open, and Briche Gonz\u00e1lez would join her grandmother in removing the pulp and seeds from the shell, which would then be used as fertiliser.\n\nThe agricultural landscape where their farm lies, nestled in southern Colombia, had been maintained by Afro-descendant communities since colonial times.\n\nBriche Gonz\u00e1lez would follow her grandmother around in the forest where her family also grew different trees for timber, medicinal plants, coffee, spices and herbs for cooking.\n\n\u201cI just became enchanted with all of that,\u201d she says. Today, Briche Gonz\u00e1lez is part of the grassroots organisation Proceso de Comunidades Negras (PCN), which advocates for the rights and recognition of Afro-descendant peoples in southern Colombia.\n\nAfro-descendant communities in Latin America have long cultivated \u201cedible landscapes\u201d, which grow in the midst of natural forests and mimic the surrounding flora. Across the region, Afro-descendant peoples manage about 200m hectares (2m sq km or 494m acres) of these agroforestry systems in biodiversity hotspots, of which only 5% are legally recognised as collectively titled territories.\n\nFor decades, those communities have argued that they play a critical role in protecting biodiversity and therefore need legal protection over their lands. Until recently, there was little scientific data to support their claims.\n\nNew research changes that. A paper published recently in Nature Communications Earth & Environment is the first peer-reviewed study quantifying the role of Afro-descendant peoples\u2019 contributions to biodiversity, carbon sequestration and the reduction of deforestation, says Martha Cecilia Rosero-Pe\u00f1a, a co-author and environmental sociologist.\n\nResearchers analysed formally recognised Afro-descendant lands in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Suriname, covering about 9.9m hectares. They found that more than half of this land (56%) overlaps with the highest 5% of biodiverse areas on Earth. In Ecuador, the figure is striking: 99% of all Afro-descendant land is in biodiversity hotspots, while in Colombia almost 92% of Afro-descendant lands are in the top 5% of areas for biodiversity.\n\nThe study also found that deforestation rates in Afro-descendant lands were 29% lower than in protected areas, and 55% lower than land on the edge of a protected area.\n\nKlaudia C\u00e1rdenas Botero, an environmental anthropologist at the Humboldt Institute in Colombia, who was not involved in the study, says: \u201cThis means that practices historically classified as \u2018subsistence\u2019 are, in fact, conservation strategies that are as effective \u2013 or even more effective \u2013 than many state policies for protected areas.\u201d\n\nTo understand why Afro-descendant communities have preserved the forest so well, Rosero-Pe\u00f1a dug into scientific records dating back to the 1500s. What she found was a hidden side-effect of the European plantation model in the Americas.\n\n\u201cScience always focuses on the history of plantations and enslaved people,\u201d Rosero-Pe\u00f1a says. \u201cBut it rarely tells us what they ate.\u201d\n\nUnlike the Europeans, who did not know how to grow food in the tropics, most of the Africans were taken from one tropical region to another. They were in charge of food production on the plantations, and adapted farming systems from Africa, blending local and African plants such as yams, okra, pigeon peas, plantains and millet, Rosero-Pe\u00f1a says.\n\nAgricultural knowledge was also a lifeline to freedom: hidden crops would grow along the escape routes enslaved Africans traversed many times, carrying rice seeds hidden in their braids. Escapers had to imitate the forest to stay hidden, which meant planting diverse crops, minimising land clearing, and avoiding fire. West African women adapted rice farming to drought-prone regions by timing it with river tides.\n\n\u201cThese forests \u2013 and this paper shows it clearly \u2013 have co-evolved with the communities that inhabit them,\u201d says Johana Herrera Arango, director of the Observatory of Ethnic and Peasant Territories at Bogot\u00e1\u2019s Javeriana University, who was not involved in the study. \u201cBiological diversity is also a human creation.\u201d\n\nOnce slavery ended, many Afro-descendant communities turned to agriculture and some became powerful cacao producers. Unlike plantations, these farms thrived as edible forests.\n\nWhen Briche Gonz\u00e1lez was a child, echoes of the cacao boom remained. The farm\u2019s cacao and coffee beans allowed her grandmother to raise nine children and their offspring. And though many Afro-descendant families lost most of their land during forced land reforms in the 1940s, it was the expansion of sugar plantations in the 1960s and 1970s that caused the biggest declines, Briche Gonz\u00e1lez says.\n\nHarsh pesticides drifted into ancestral farms, reducing productivity. Many families sold or rented their lands to plantation owners. \u201cWhen my grandmother died, the sugar mills leased our land,\u201d Briche Gonz\u00e1lez says. \u201cNow, the house is completely walled in sugarcane.\u201d\n\nOnly a handful of ancestral farms now remain among 250,000 hectares of sugarcane plantations. But amid them, researchers have found at least 128 plant species still grow in the remaining array of trees, bushes, herbs and animals. C\u00e1rdenas Botero, from the Humboldt Institute, found a similarly astonishing number of species in black communities\u2019 farms in northern Colombia: 272 species of plants and 151 insect species.\n\nEfforts to keep that legacy alive are under way. Briche Gonz\u00e1lez, who is an ecology technician, helped design a university diploma programme in agro-ecology for those tending family farms. The PCN is pressing Colombia\u2019s culture ministry to recognise their farms as part of the national heritage. Other groups are piloting an \u201cAfro-food corridor\u201d spanning 1,640 hectares.\n\nFood forests, Briche Gonz\u00e1lez says, \u201care everything. They are life, no matter where they grow.\u201d"

                "text": "The black-and-white-clad hordes had turned up wondering if it would finally be the day. There was optimism and yet massive apprehension, too. The Newcastle United support had lived on the ends of their nerves since advancing to this Carabao Cup final. When you last won a domestic trophy in 1955 \u2013 the FA Cup victory against Manchester City, the goals from Jackie Milburn, Bobby \u00adMitchell and George Hannah going down in folklore \u2013 it was going to be this way.\n\nBut it was the day, one when new \u00adlegends were born. Above all, it was just a giant Newcastle party. Yes, there was tension at the end, of course there was when the board went up to show eight additional minutes and \u00adFederico Chiesa, on as a \u00adLiverpool substitute, ran through to make it 2-1, the goal given after a review showed he was onside.\n\nAnd yet once Alexander Isak had scored for 2-0 with a clinical \u00adhalf\u2011volley early in the second half, the result never truly felt in doubt. Newcastle refused to allow it to become yet another hard-luck story. They drove this triumph through their collective will. They were in control throughout.\n\nWhere to start? There was Dan Burn, who scored the first goal before the interval with a thundering epic of a header and refused to concede an inch in defence. All this in the week of his first England callup. There was Bruno Guimar\u00e3es and Joelinton in midfield. There was Isak. And then there was Eddie Howe.\n\nWhen the manager took over in November 2021, Newcastle were in the Premier League\u2019s relegation zone. He began by restoring sta\u00adbility, self\u2011respect, and then led them up the division and into the Champions League.\n\nThe \u00addismantling of Paris Saint-Germain in October 2023 on the night when St James\u2019s Park hosted Champions League \u00adfootball for the first season since 2002-03 will live for ever. It was topped by this \u2013 Howe\u2019s glory, perfectly calibrated, the most tangible of dividends for the club\u2019s Saudi owners.\n\nNewcastle were without the suspended Anthony Gordon, the injured Lewis Hall and Sven Botman. Their form had been erratic. They had not beaten Liverpool since December 2015. None of it mattered as Arne Slot\u2019s team were brought to their knees for the second time in a week.\n\nSlot had wanted to see a reaction to the Champions League last-16 exit against PSG but it did not come. The league title surely will and that will represent an outstanding achievement. But the impression here was that they were a team working on muscle memory, running on empty.\n\nIt was easy to feel that it meant more to Newcastle, principally because of their long wait for silverware and also because these type types of showpieces have been so rare for them. It was just their sixth \u00adWembley cup final since 1955. Not only had they lost each previous one, they had scored but a single goal (Alan \u00adGowling against Manchester City in the 1976 League Cup final).\n\nHowe\u2019s team felt the emotion from their fans; the passion and noise pounded. The black\u2011and\u2011white scarves held outstretched as one or swirled above heads, also as one, were such a feature of the scene. The players were not overwhelmed. They channelled it, they mastered the occasion.\n\nNewcastle ran hard from the first whistle, physicality to the fore. One first-half moment summed things up, Joelinton sprinting back on 38 \u00adminutes to win the ball off Jarell Quansah. Joelinton clenched his fists and screamed at the Newcastle crowd. It was not the only time that he got his foot in to good effect. Or cele\u00adbrated wildly with the supporters.\n\nIt was bedlam when Burn scored, the TV cutaways picking out Alan Shearer losing his mind, Ant & Dec too. The new England manager, Thomas Tuchel, had joked that it was easy to overlook Burn because of his size and how did Liverpool leave him so free? They had not heeded the warning in the 36th \u00adminute when Burn nodded a corner back for Guimar\u00e3es, who could not muster the power on a flicked header.\n\nNewcastle looked consistently for Burn on corners and when Kieran Trippier drove over there was nobody close to the centre-half. He had started his run from deep and if the leap was majestic there was something cinematic in how he butted the ball from quite a distance into the far corner.\n\nSandro Tonali had curled a shot wide on 24 minutes and it was fair to write that Liverpool did not turn up before the interval. Straight after the Burn goal, Luis D\u00edaz headed back for Diogo Jota but he could not sort out his feet. It was a completely isolated first-half flicker from Liverpool.\n\nNewcastle were in dreamland early in the second half when Isak banged home. They had put the ball in the net a couple of minutes beforehand, Isak turning home after \u00adCaoimhin Kelleher\u2019s save from Burn \u2013 only for the offside flag to go up. It had followed another corner, \u00adJoelinton teeing up Burn from beyond the far post. Now Tino Livramento hung up a high cross and Jacob Murphy just wanted it more than Andy Robertson. When his header went to Isak, there was no doubt about the finish.\n\nSlot made changes. One of them, Curtis Jones, drew a smart tip\u2011over from Nick Pope. But it would have been over shortly afterwards had Kelleher not kept out an improvised close-range volley from Isak.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s hopes were faint, even when the board went up to signal the stoppage time. They scored when Guimar\u00e3es tried a risky spin move and was robbed by the substitute, Harvey Elliott, who played in Chiesa. There would be no \u00adoutlandish \u00adcomeback. When the full-time \u00adwhistle sounded, Newcastle could start to drink it in."

                "article_summary": "China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has successfully launched three types of aircraft using its advanced electromagnetic catapult system, marking a significant advancement in its naval capabilities. This development positions the Fujian on par with the US Navy's USS Gerald R. Ford, although it is conventionally powered rather than nuclear. Meanwhile, a US Congressional delegation is in Beijing to discuss military communication and reduce tensions amid concerns over China's growing military assertiveness.",

                "text": "China\u2019s latest and most capable aircraft carrier has used its new electromagnetic catapult to successfully launch three types of aircraft, according to Chinese state media, which released footage of the launches for the first time to mark the technological breakthrough.\n\nIn footage released by state broadcaster CCTV on Monday, China\u2019s fifth-generation J-35 stealth fighter, 4.5-generation J-15T fighter and KJ-600 early warning and control aircraft were seen taking off from the Fujian aircraft carrier using its advanced launching system, also known as EMALS.\n\nState media hailed the tests as another \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in China\u2019s aircraft carrier development and a \u201cmilestone\u201d in advancing its naval transformation.\n\nThe only other aircraft carrier in the world that has the EMALS system is the US Navy\u2019s newest carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, which was certified for flight deck operations using the EMALS system in the spring of 2022.\n\nThe development comes as a US Congress delegation is in Beijing for talks aimed at bolstering bilateral exchanges including military-to-military communication, in the first such visit to China in six years.\n\nThe successful tests on the Fujian, which included both catapult launch and arrested landing, mean the ship\u2019s commissioning \u2013 when it officially enters the People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) fleet \u2013 could be only a few weeks away, said analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain.\n\nFurther certifications can be expected in the next few months with final trials on the Fujian\u2019s ability to integrate with the PLA Air Force and Rocket Force likely to come next spring, Schuster said.\n\nThe EMALS system allows carrier aircraft to take off with heavier weapon and fuel loads than those operating off China\u2019s two older carriers, the Shandong and Liaoning, which feature ski-jump-type take-off ramps, enabling Fujian\u2019s aircraft to strike enemy targets from greater distances.\n\nAnalysts have said that the Fujian\u2019s ability to launch larger warplanes carrying higher munitions loads to farther distances will give the carrier a greater combat range than its predecessors in the Chinese fleet, providing the PLAN with so-called \u201cblue-water\u201d capabilities.\n\nWhile the EMALS system puts the Fujian on par with the US Navy\u2019s USS Gerald R Ford \u2013 the US Navy\u2019s 10 older carriers, the Nimitz class, rely on steam-powered catapults to launch aircraft \u2013 the Chinese carrier is not nuclear powered like all the US carriers.\n\nNuclear power gives the US carriers the ability to remain at sea for as long as crew provisions last. The Fujian is powered by conventional fuel, meaning it must either make a port call or be met by a tanker at sea to refuel.\n\nMilitary communication\n\nAs China ramps up its naval power, it has also acted more assertively in regional waters from the Taiwan Strait to the East and South China Seas, drawing frequent criticism from the US as well as its regional allies like Japan and the Philippines.\n\nOn Tuesday, US Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee who\u2019s leading the delegation in Beijing, said the military-to-military relationship between the US and China is of \u201cparticular concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina is the most rapidly growing military and the most rapidly growing nuclear power in the world. The US has the biggest military in the world and the biggest nuclear arsenal. It is dangerous for us not to be having regular communications about our capabilities and intentions, so we understand each other, and so that miscalculations and misunderstandings don\u2019t lead to larger problems,\u201d Smith told reporters in Beijing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this with our ships, our planes, their ships, their planes, coming entirely too close to one another. We need to have a better conversation about de-conflicting those things,\u201d he said, while calling for the US and China to ramp up dialogue on nuclear weapons.\n\nThe rapid development of AI, drones, cyber and space capabilities has only exacerbated the risk of misunderstanding, he added.\n\nThe bipartisan group arrived in Beijing on Sunday and had a series of meetings with Chinese officials, including Premier Li Qiang, Defense Minister Dong Jun and Vice Premier He Lifeng, who has been leading the trade talks with the US on behalf of China.\n\nIn their meeting on Monday, Smith told Dong that the US wanted to open up the lines of communication with China, especially on military matters.\n\nDong called on the US lawmakers to \u201cremove disruptive and restrictive factors\u201d and take constructive and pragmatic steps to improve US-China military relations, according to Chinese state media.\n\nThe trip followed a call on Friday between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping and is the latest in a flurry of high-level engagement between the two countries ahead of a potential summit between their leaders.\n\nFollowing the call, Trump said he will meet Xi at the APEC summit in South Korea next month, and that he will visit China early next year. The leaders also agreed that Xi would come to the United States \u201cat the appropriate time,\u201d Trump said."

                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "It was another tumultuous year for the podcast industry, with layoffs and cancellations at Spotify, Pushkin, WNYC, and NPR, which cut four of its series and ten per cent of its staff in March. But great work continued to be made, including by independent and listener-supported shows. There were bold new projects from veteran producers and creators; series that managed to make unbearable subjects addictively listenable; storytelling with the confidence to engage us without sensationalizing; and even, improbably, a funds-and-consciousness-raising podcast, \u201cStrike Force Five,\u201d hosted by the biggest names in late-night TV. (Cue thunderclap.) Several perennial favorites impressed, among them \u201cHeavyweight,\u201d \u201cRumble Strip,\u201d \u201cSlow Burn,\u201d \u201cThis American Life\u201d (including the \u201cJane Doe\u201d episode), \u201cEar Hustle,\u201d \u201cThe Paris Review Podcast,\u201d and \u201cLa Brega,\u201d whose music-focussed second season was followed by cancellation; may it find another home. My picks for the year\u2019s ten best are below.\n\n10. \u201cClassy with Jonathan Menjivar\u201d\n\nJonathan Menjivar\u2019s exploration of class\u2014how we perceive it, how we\u2019ve internalized it, whether we try to change ourselves in relation to it\u2014begins with a discussion of teeth. Menjivar, a longtime audio producer and the son of L.A. factory workers, goes to the dentist and is scolded by a hygienist about the \u201ccrowding\u201d in his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s true\u2014my teeth are all jacked up in the front,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when she said that, all I heard was, \u2018Your teeth are crooked, because you were too poor.\u2019 \u201d It\u2019s an \u201cemblem of my class status stamped right on my face,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m done keeping my toothy mouth shut about it.\u201d Menjivar explores issues like class disparity in military service, the role of race in fashion, and trying not to be a \u201cclasshole\u201d as he interviews a range of figures, including the comedian and actor Wyatt Cenac, who talks about debt, Hollywood, and the creative life; Terry Gross, Menjivar\u2019s old boss, who grew up working class in Sheepshead Bay and became synonymous with NPR bookishness; and the British pop icon Jarvis Cocker, of Pulp, whose hit \u201cCommon People\u201d became an anthem to many. \u201cI wanted to find a different class,\u201d Cocker tells Menjivar. \u201cI wanted to find my own place to live, and people to live in that world with me.\u201d\n\n9. \u201cMagnificent Jerk\u201d\n\nBesides having the best title of the year, \u201cMagnificent Jerk,\u201d from the producer-host Maya Lin Sugarman, has a singularly amazing premise: it sets out to solve the mystery of how Sugarman\u2019s late uncle secretly wrote a semi-autobiographical screenplay about Chinese American gangsters that morphed into a straight-to-video action movie set in Eastern Europe, starring Burt Reynolds, Ice-T, and a pre-comeback Rob Lowe. (\u201cI wanna stop smokin\u2019 rock . . . real bad,\u201d Lowe slurs in the movie, 1997\u2019s \u201cCrazy Six.\u201d) Sugarman\u2019s uncle, Galen Yuen, straddled the worlds of street crime and Hollywood\u2014after getting out of jail, the podcast says, he moved to L.A. and played roles like Low Life No. 1 in \u201cKindergarten Cop\u201d\u2014and she briefly lived with him after college. But she didn\u2019t know much about his past, and her education takes us to a pool hall in seventies Oakland Chinatown, a B-movie shoot in nineties Bratislava, and a recent \u201cCrazy Six\u201d screening in L.A. By the end, it\u2019s become a moving rumination on why we keep family secrets, and what we choose to hide.\n\n8. \u201cNormal Gossip\u201d\n\nKelsey McKinney and Alex Sujong Laughlin\u2019s cozy-chatty podcast, now part of Radiotopia, has been widely beloved since its d\u00e9but, in 2022, and this year\u2019s episodes have continued to be delicious. In each, McKinney, who hosts, introduces a distinguished guest, gabs with them about the role of gossip in their life, and then gives us the good stuff: some actual gossip, courtesy of \u201ca friend of a friend,\u201d that\u2019s full of sharply described scenes and characters, staggeringly nutty decision-making, and plenty of surprises. The stories avoid the head-shaking horror of what we find in many advice columns or subreddits, and they\u2019re not mean. They deal with the weird, mind-bending minutiae of daily life: a house-sitting-for-a-rich-cousin gig, a local-dog-park Facebook group, a \u201cWho stole the despised relative\u2019s hair straightener before the wedding?\u201d mystery. The stories\u2019 oratorio-like endings evoke the absurd, well-constructed pleasures of a \u201cSeinfeld\u201d episode, but the show never loses its organic tone. Many scripted podcasts struggle to achieve narrative power or conversational naturalism; \u201cNormal Gossip\u201d does both, and makes it look easy.\n\n7. \u201cThe 13th Step\u201d\n\nYou might not expect a public-radio expos\u00e9 to turn into a true-crime thriller, but that\u2019s what happens in \u201cThe 13th Step.\u201d When the New Hampshire Public Radio reporter Lauren Chooljian gets a tip that Eric Spofford, the leader of the state\u2019s biggest addiction-treatment network, has allegedly been sexually harassing and assaulting women, she uncovers multiple accounts of abuse. Then chaos ensues. In the twelve-step community, \u201cthe thirteenth step\u201d refers to preying on a newcomer; with extraordinary sensitivity, Chooljian shows how coping with newfound sobriety in a twelve-step setting\u2014with vulnerability and a willingness to share personal stories\u2014can also lead to manipulation. Spofford, the series indicates, was a master at this. \u201cWhat he ended up being like was, like, the supreme commander of recovery, like, god of recovery,\u201d one woman says. \u201cAnd to have God send me a friend request was, like, \u2018Whoa, that\u2019s so cool.\u2019 \u201d During the course of Chooljian\u2019s reporting, Spofford sold his business for what he claimed was more than a hundred million dollars, moved to Florida, began posting vainglorious YouTube videos, and sued Chooljian and her station for defamation. Also, someone began throwing bricks through Chooljian\u2019s windows and spray-painting threats on her house. As her reporting expands, this meta-plot darkly, perversely illustrates her themes, just as much as the story itself does.\n\n6. \u201cThe Big Dig\u201d\n\nIf you spent any time in Boston in the nineties, you likely noticed endless construction, enormous piles of dirt, and signs that said \u201cROME WASN\u2019T BUILT IN A DAY.\u201d This was the Big Dig, the most expensive highway project in the history of the United States, which replaced Boston\u2019s intrusive, city-bisecting elevated highways with a network of subterranean and underwater tunnels. It also added beautiful parks and bridges above ground, and became shorthand for a certain kind of civic nightmare. This nine-part series, produced by GBH News and reported and hosted by Ian Coss, excavates the whole fascinating story, with an eye toward understanding current-day cynicism and idealism about infrastructure. Coss, a Boston-based audio whiz and podcaster (\u201cForever Is a Long Time\u201d ), was a toddler in 1991, when Big Dig construction began, and had graduated from high school when it ended, in 2007; he brings the story to life with original music and excellent archival audio, which illuminates the mid-century establishment of the highway system, as well as the various Bostonian personalities that drove or impaired the Big Dig. As we listen, we find ourselves pondering things like transit authorities and slurry walls with feverish intensity; throughout, Coss deploys memorable details, like a key character, hard at work, waking up one night with his nose in a pizza.\n\n5. \u201cGrapevine\u201d\n\nOne of the strengths and amazements of \u201cGrapevine,\u201d produced by the stellar team of Mike Hixenbaugh and Antonia Hylton from NBC News, is that it delivers the same kind of knockout punch that its predecessor \u201cSouthlake\u201d did. \u201cSouthlake\u201d explored how white parents upset about \u201ccritical race theory\u201d took over a Texas school board, and then an entire town; \u201cGrapevine,\u201d reported in the next town over, details a parallel situation about trans kids and L.G.B.T.Q.+ rights\u2014or, as yet more angry parents call it, \u201cwoke gender ideology.\u201d Hixenbaugh and Hylton are remarkably thorough; they interview\u2014and really listen to\u2014teens, parents, teachers, and others, forming a vivid picture of not just an issue but a community. Several of the characters are hugely sympathetic, including a dad who is gently, firmly supportive of his trans daughter and a high-school English teacher at the center of the firestorm, who had loaned the girl a graphic novel called \u201cThe Prince and the Dressmaker.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cArticles of Interest\u201d\n\nIf you recently looked at Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s latex travel coat, shook your head, and thought, I sure hope he doesn\u2019t rip that, you may have listened to the \u201cPaper and Rubber\u201d episode of Avery Trufelman\u2019s terrific series about clothes and culture, in which we learn that latex, in all its slippery exoticism, is nearly impossible to sew. This year, Trufelman followed up last year\u2019s season, \u201cAmerican Ivy,\u201d about the history and influence of preppy clothing, with biweekly episodes that feature a closetful of topics, including corduroy, paisley, plus sizes, pointe shoes, and, in a crossover with \u201cEar Hustle,\u201d prison uniforms. \u201cArticles,\u201d which started as a miniseries for Trufelman\u2019s longtime employer \u201c99% Invisible,\u201d is always well researched, unexpected, and entertaining, and is all the more impressive for the fact that Trufelman writes, produces, reports, sound designs, mixes, masters, and hosts it, with a voice that\u2019s like velvet for the ears. In an episode about the importance of articulating one\u2019s personal style, she talks to a woman who describes her own as \u201cchill, modern, and classic\u201d; the same could be said of the series, and if it were a dress, it would have pockets.\n\n3. \u201cThe Kids of Rutherford County\u201d / \u201cUnreformed: The Story of the Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children\u201d\n\nTwo remarkable series this year featured deep investigations about incarcerated kids. Meribah Knight, a Nashville Public Radio producer who made the excellent Peabody-winning series \u201cThe Promise,\u201d about the city\u2019s public-housing and school systems, joined forces with ProPublica and Serial Productions to make \u201cThe Kids of Rutherford County,\u201d a four-part series about a Tennessee county that arrested and illegally jailed children\u2014hundreds, possibly thousands of children\u2014and got away with it for more than a decade. \u201cA boy accused of stealing a football jersey\u2014jailed. A girl accused of pulling someone\u2019s hair\u2014jailed. A girl trying to use a blank check at a school book fair\u2014jailed,\u201d Knight says. Knight tells the story via several compelling characters, including Wes Clark, a young defense attorney struggling to recover from OxyContin addiction, who tries to get justice for the kids as he deals with struggles of his own. Meanwhile, \u201cUnreformed,\u201d a stunning and exhaustively researched series from the journalist Josie Duffy Rice, tells the story of an Alabama institution commonly known as Mt. Meigs, where generations of Black children endured horrific abuse\u2014some of it, like a punishment known as the Rock Pile, almost dreamlike in its surreal cruelty. It\u2019s an often excruciating listen, but the presence of several of the institution\u2019s survivors, including the renowned artist and musician Lonnie Holley, offers some beauty in the darkness.\n\n2. \u201cNext Year in Moscow\u201d\n\nThe Economist has become a reliably great source of thoughtfully produced, expertly reported podcasts, including \u201cDrum Tower,\u201d about China, last year\u2019s \u201cThe Prince,\u201d about Xi Jinping, and \u201cNext Year in Moscow,\u201d about Russians trying to cope with what their country has become in the era of Putin\u2019s war crimes. Our host is The Economist\u2019s Arkady Ostrovsky, who travels to Istanbul, Europe, \u201cand the fringes of the old Soviet empire\u201d to talk to Russians who left when Putin\u2019s attacks on Ukraine began, in 2022. \u201cI clearly remember this feeling that this is not my world anymore,\u201d one says. Another remembers what amazed him about Gorbachev, and what Russia needs again: the understanding \u201cthat human life and dignity would take priority over the prestige of the state.\u201d The sound design is artful throughout, as when a crackling recording of Leo Tolstoy railing against state-sponsored executions, in 1908, segues to a discussion of Tolstoy\u2019s symbolic role after the invasion began, with police arresting Russians quoting him on placards. \u201cTo a nation undergoing a moral catastrophe, the old man offered a point of certainty,\u201d Ostrovsky says.\n\n1. \u201cThink Twice: Michael Jackson\u201d\n\n\u201cThink Twice\u201d astonished me twice. First, for existing: when I learned that Leon Neyfakh, one of the most consistently creative forces in podcasts, was releasing a series about Michael Jackson, I thought, Why? After \u201cLeaving Neverland,\u201d the 2019 HBO documentary that suggested that Jackson had indeed sexually abused boys, what else needed to be said? Then, when I listened, \u201cThink Twice\u201d astonished me with the breadth of its accomplishment. One of Neyfakh\u2019s strengths is his ability to upend the fossilized narratives of a cultural or historical moment, laying out details and stories we overlooked. (See also Neyfakh\u2019s other excellent series this year, \u201cFiasco: Vigilante.\u201d) As Neyfakh\u2019s co-host, Jay Smooth, observes, after the documentary\u2019s release, it felt almost like Jackson had died a second death. But his music continues to be everywhere, and \u201cMJ the Musical\u201d is a hit on Broadway. \u201cThink Twice,\u201d which incorporates interviews, rare archival audio, and meticulous reporting, doesn\u2019t seek to defend or condemn the singer; it just helps us make sense of him, and the results are revelatory.\n\nIt begins, as Neyfakh\u2019s series always do, with an unforgettable scene. At the 1994 N.A.A.C.P. Image Awards, the \u201cCool Runnings\u201d actor Doug E. Doug, having just given Whitney Houston an award for the \u201cBodyguard\u201d soundtrack, is amazed to see Jackson, who was accused of child molestation a few months earlier, show up unexpectedly, come onstage, and deliver an impromptu speech in his own defense, in that soft, strong, confident voice. The crowd gives him a standing ovation. A year earlier, the author Stephen King recalls, Jackson had come to him with a short-film idea, in which he would play a Boo Radley-like figure who alarms parents but is understood by children; when police announced they were investigating Jackson, production shut down. (The short was called \u201cIs This Scary?\u201d) \u201cThink Twice\u201d homes in on such moments, which evidence Jackson\u2019s other kind of performance\u2014a performance of innocence, increasingly unconvincing as the years went by. The series, listening closely to the music we love and the realities we don\u2019t, achieves a kind of miracle of content and tone. If \u201cThink Twice\u201d lets us process Jackson\u2019s death, it\u2019s because it allows us to mourn for the person we wanted him to be. \u2666"

                "text": "A dating show modeled on \u201cLove Island\u201d that features Pakistani contestants has sparked anger in the Muslim-majority country, despite no episodes being aired yet, and the series being only accessible on YouTube.\n\nThe country\u2019s broadcasting regulator said Saturday it was not in a position to act on the public complaints because it had no authority over the streaming platform.\n\nLazawal Ishq, or Eternal Love, is hosted by Pakistani actress Ayesha Omar and filmed in Istanbul. Adapted from the Turkish format, A\u015fk Adas\u0131, and resembling the successful \u201cLove Island\u201d international franchise, it brings together four Pakistani men and women in a luxury villa where their every interaction is filmed. In Pakistan, extra-marital relationships are illegal, and there are stigmas around dating.\n\nLast week, Omar shared a teaser of her cruising along the Bosporus before welcoming contestants into the villa. But the promo quickly drew criticism online, with detractors labeling the format \u201cun-Islamic\u201d and accusing it of copying Western culture.\n\nThe flood of public complaints about the Urdu-language show prompted Pakistani regulators to issue a clarification, saying they were unable to do anything.\n\nMuhammad Tahir, a spokesperson for the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, said Saturday that the program was neither being broadcast on mainstream media nor on any television channel licensed by the authority.\n\n\u201cIt does not fall within our domain,\u201d Tahir told the Associated Press. \u201cWe do not regulate YouTube, and this content is not from any television channel.

                "text": "The Star Wars universe is returning to the big screen with our first look at The Mandalorian and Grogu, next summer\u2019s big bet from Disney.\n\nThe film follows the hit Disney+ show The Mandalorian and was born out of the delay insisted on the fourth season by the Hollywood strikes of 2023. In that time, the strategy for the franchise was re-evaluated and a film was prioritised over the fourth season.\n\nIt marks the first Star Wars film since 2019\u2019s The Rise of Skywalker, which received mixed reviews but made over $1bn at the global box office.\n\nThe film follows Pedro Pascal as The Mandalorian, a bounty hunter and his ward Grogu (aka Baby Yoda). It will also star Sigourney Weaver and Jeremy Allen White as Rotta the Hutt, the son of Jabba the Hutt.\n\nJon Favreau, who shepherded the series to the small screen, will also direct. It marks his first film as a director since 2019\u2019s The Lion King. His credits also include Iron Man, Elf and Chef.\n\nHe has recently spoken about the film\u2019s theme of parenting and how he hopes it will resonate with fans. \u201cAs Star Wars fans who are my age, who grew up with the original films, grow up and have kids of their own, I think it\u2019s nice that there\u2019s a hero that is going through what they\u2019re going through,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like when they were young they [could] relate to Luke Skywalker, now they can relate to Mando.\u201d\n\nThe Mandalorian and Grogu is set to be released in May 2026, a summer which will also see the release of Supergirl, Toy Story 5, Scary Movie 6, Minions 3 and Spider-Man: Brand New Day.\n\nThe release of the trailer follows the unveiling of the first image from Star Wars: Starfighter, another new movie currently in production. That film stars Ryan Gosling, Amy Adams, Mia Goth and Aaron Pierre and will be released in summer 2027.\n\nLongtime Star Wars producer and president of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, recently spoke about the new strategy for film.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very generational brand, and we want to sustain that, and we work hard to sustain that,\u201d she said. \u201cSo George [Lucas] gave us the gift of storytelling being across lots of different genres, and that gives us a lot of opportunity to try things. What we\u2019ve really enjoyed about the streaming space is we\u2019ve been able to experiment. It\u2019s harder to do that in the movie space. And now I think that that\u2019s why it feels so good to be able to move into a Mandalorian movie as we\u2019re coming off of three seasons of a very successful show. We\u2019ve actually built an audience for that, and we gave the young audience an opportunity to enter Star Wars at a different place and not feel like you have to have seen everything. It can become their Star Wars. And that, I think, is the fun storytelling challenge.\u201d"

Using renewable energy to power an electrolyser can manufacture a zero emissions liquid fuel.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nFortescue said it was looking at alternative uses for its sites in Arizona and Gladstone, and Pichot added that \u201cgreen energy and green hydrogen is key to our future\u201d, and while costs would come down \u201cwe must also be realistic and disciplined\u201d.\n\nThe company\u2019s green metals project in the Pilbara was progressing, Pichot added.\n\nSimon Nicholas, a global steel sector analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said: \u201cThere has clearly been way too much hype, and politicians and policies have been far too distracted by nonsensical uses of green hydrogen \u2013 things like household heating, or adding hydrogen into the gas distribution network, and electric vehicles are clearly winning the race [against hydrogen cell vehicles].\u201d\n\nHe said subsidies provided to the industry needed to be more targeted for green hydrogen for domestic use and for uses that \u201cmade more sense\u201d such as in replacing hydrogen derived from gas used for fertilisers or in steel production.\n\nA spokesperson for the federal industry minister, Tim Ayres, said the Gladstone announcement was \u201cdisappointing for the workers and businesses connected to the project\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut we know green hydrogen is essential to manufacturing and industry in a net zero future, and Australia has one of the best hydrogen development opportunities in the world,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nThe federal government has provided $44.9m for a seperate Fortescue project \u2013 the Gladstone Electrolyser Facility \u2013 under its modern manufacturing initiative. The Guardian understands there could be flow-on impacts from the closure of PEM50 to that grant.\n\nThe spokesperson said the department was \u201ccontinuing to work with Fortescue on its delivery of the Gladstone Electrolyser Facility project\u201d, which is located at the same site as PEM50.\n\nThey said it was normal practice for grant agreements to allow the government to recoup funds if a project can\u2019t deliver what was agreed to.\n\nA statement added: \u201cGovernment support in developing hydrogen opportunities around the country provides additional certainty for projects, however how they progress ultimately remains a commercial decision for the parties involved.\n\n\u201cStanding up a new industry is not easy, but we\u2019re unapologetic about pursuing opportunities so regional communities continue to thrive through the energy transformation.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Fortescue said the company had been \u201cupfront with the government\u201d and would \u201creturn funds where required under the grant agreement\u201d.\n\n\u201cThose conversations are already underway,\u201d they said."

With a focus on LGBTQ+ representation and a unique blend of camp and pop aesthetics, Roan's success appears to be sustainable as she continues to gain traction beyond her initial queer fanbase.",
                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "The album at UK No 1 this week is titled The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess \u2013 though for its creator, breakthrough pop star Chappell Roan, the past year has been all rise and no fall.\n\nWhen the Missouri-born 26-year-old released her debut album last September, it marked the beginning of a slow-burning second act in pop. In her late teens, she had been signed as a downbeat songwriter by Atlantic and subsequently dropped. The experience prompted her to cultivate an outre persona that allowed the queer musician born Kayleigh Amstutz to express everything she had once repressed, growing up in a Christian community. \u201cI grew up thinking being gay was bad and a sin,\u201d she told the Guardian last year. \u201cI went to the gay club once and it was so impactful, like magic. It was the opposite of everything I was taught.\u201d She then hustled her way \u2013 via stints back home working in a drive-thru doughnut shop \u2013 to a deal with Island.\n\nRoan draws from the mega-pop of the 2010s, from Lady Gaga to Taylor Swift \u2013 then laces it with sexually frank asides and lavish doses of camp, and performs it with a maximalist, absurd aesthetic indebted to drag, John Waters and Freddie Mercury.\n\nWhat first resonated with queer gen Z fans on TikTok in particular has since become a more widespread phenomenon \u2013 or a Femininomenon, as the album\u2019s riotous opening track would have it. At the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago last weekend \u2013 where she performed in a lucha libre outfit, surrounded by female bodybuilders \u2013 Roan was upgraded to a prime slot and drew what organisers estimated to be the event\u2019s biggest crowd ever.\n\nJust a year ago, US music industry magazine Billboard reported: \u201cPop stars aren\u2019t popping like they used to \u2013 do labels have a plan?\u201d No one had seriously broken through since Olivia Rodrigo in January 2021. But this summer has been ruled by a fresh pop cohort: Brat mastermind Charli xcx, Espresso singer Sabrina Carpenter and Roan. Where the former two have been building for a decade, Roan is essentially brand new.\n\nHer rise, said NPR music editor Hazel Cills, came in part as a result of Roan\u2019s ability to operate in so many different spaces, from serving her core audience on TikTok, to finding new fans when she supported Rodrigo on tour \u2013 they share a producer in Daniel Nigro \u2013 to spectacular performances on NPR\u2019s Tiny Desk concert series and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, then festival stages. \u201cShe\u2019s been building up her presence in all of these different spheres,\u201d said Cills. In April, Roan released a new, non-album single, Good Luck, Babe!, about her romantic travails with a closeted girl. \u201cIt\u2019s her biggest and best song so far, it can do really well on television, at festivals \u2013 that catapulted her in a much bigger way,\u201d said Cills.\n\nAnd where many pop stars who made their name on TikTok struggle to translate their music to the stage, Roan\u2019s panache for performance has set her apart: she has played dressed as the Statue of Liberty \u2013 at a festival where she said she had turned down an invitation to perform at a White House Pride event until they truly offered \u201cliberty, justice and freedom for all\u201d \u2013 as well as drag queen Divine and Marie Antoinette, and themes her shows to inspire audience costumes.\n\n\u201cFor the past 10 years, alternative pop has been very bedroom oriented,\u201d said Cills. \u201cPost-Lorde, Halsey, Clairo, even Rodrigo \u2013 they\u2019re all indebted to singer-songwriter traditions and making quiet, minimalist music.\u201d From Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s 2023 film Poor Things to British band the Last Dinner Party and Roan, baroque aesthetics are now everywhere. \u201cThere\u2019s been a huge shift towards music that should exist outside the bedroom,\u201d said Cills. Young audiences are yearning for the theatricality of early 2010s pop stars that they were too young to experience, something the pandemic made impossible. \u201cChappell is catering to all these desires and can take that mantle.\u201d\n\nRoan has been explicit about her debt to drag. She introduces herself as \u201cyour favourite artist\u2019s favourite artist\u201d \u2013 a riff on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race winner Sasha Colby calling herself \u201cyour favourite drag queen\u2019s favourite drag queen\u201d \u2013 and has said that becoming a drag version of herself, otherwise an introverted video gamer, has allowed her to be \u201cwhatever I want\u201d. Her song Pink Pony Club draws from the aforementioned night she experienced at West Hollywood club the Abbey. \u201cFans have been visiting just to experience the place that inspired the song,\u201d said club owner Tristan Schukraft, \u201cand the dancefloor goes wild whenever we play her music.\u201d (They also added a Pink Pony cocktail to the menu.)\n\nAt Roan\u2019s headline shows, she invites drag artists to support, and has raised money for LGBTQ+ supporting charities such as the New York City-based For the Gworls, Kaleidoscope Trust in the UK, and GLO Center in the Ozarks, Missouri (she also provides a scholarship scheme offering tickets to fans on low incomes). At Heaven nightclub in London in December, drag queen Bones, the self-styled Queen of Soho, was selected after Roan\u2019s team put out a call for performers. \u201cIt was one of the best crowds I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Bones.\n\nThe history of pop is littered with artists exploiting drag without necessarily respecting the culture or benefiting the performers. Roan feels different, said Bones. \u201cI know American queens who know her as the girl who used to come to the club and support the queens. Like Lady Gaga, you know exactly who she is \u2013 there\u2019s a certain authenticity from the get-go.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t move at drag shows now, Bones said, for queens doing Roan\u2019s songs. \u201cEvery song on the album is so great and sounds so different, or people are doing the same song in a completely different look \u2013 it\u2019s so cool.\u201d At a time when drag artists are being persecuted in the US and the UK, Roan\u2019s success felt particularly striking, said Bones. \u201cIronically, the protesters are probably driving to whatever stupid protest they\u2019re doing with Good Luck, Babe! on the radio.\u201d\n\nRoan\u2019s success had broken beyond the queer community, she said, because \u201cit\u2019s just that little bit of camp that everybody kind of loves \u2013 she has that casual star quality.\u201d\n\nMany pop stars who have experienced viral fame experience burnout \u2013 UK singer-producer PinkPantheress, who rose through TikTok, announced last week that she was cancelling all forthcoming dates to focus on her wellbeing \u2013 or are unable to translate one hit song into a career. For Cills, Roan\u2019s \u201cserious stage presence and technical talents, her ability to establish herself on social media and in more traditional spaces, signal sustainability\u201d. With six songs on the US Hot 100 this week, in addition to that probable UK No 1, Roan\u2019s rise looks unstoppable."

He made the announcement as wildfires continue to devastate southern California and significantly disrupt the film and television industry. Many in Hollywood have lost their homes in the fires, which has killed 25 people, displaced tens of thousands and hampered businesses, with costs estimated at over $250bn.\n\nHis post appears to reference the declining US box office, which has struggled to recover from the pandemic and the dual writers/actors strikes in 2023.

Experts suggest that lateness can strain relationships and may stem from aversion to certain tasks or poor time management habits. To improve punctuality, individuals can prioritize tasks, realistically assess time needed for activities, and address underlying emotional issues related to their lateness.",

                "text": "I am arguably the worst kind of late. I am never very late \u2013 the kind so egregious it almost demands a begrudging respect, as if the tardy party is an otherworldly spirit who cannot be expected to adhere to earthly conceptions of time.\n\nMy lateness is less bold, more tedious. I am perpetually running 10 to 15 minutes behind, so even when I am on time, I arrive frazzled and on edge. A few weeks ago, sprinting towards a train that was about to pull away from the station, it occurred to me that I didn\u2019t have to live this way.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say how many people are regularly late. There are not many large-scale surveys of lateness, and tardiness can depend on context: some may manage their professional time well but struggle to be punctual in their personal life, or vice versa. And while showing up 15 minutes late to a meeting is generally frowned upon, the Emily Post Institute suggests that there is a 20-minute grace period when it comes to parties.\n\nStill, it seems like I\u2019m in good company. There haven\u2019t been any major surveys recently, but in 2006, 15-20% of Americans said they were \u201cconsistently late\u201d, according to ABC News. And a 2017 survey found that nearly 30% of Americans arrive late to work each day.\n\nConsistent lateness can lead to missed meetings, appointments and travel, but it can also put a strain on relationships. Dr Fuschia Sirois, a professor of health and social psychology at Durham University, explains that delays can be interpreted by others as disrespectful. \u201cThat\u2019s really the downside of lateness, even if there was no harm intended,\u201d she says. \u201cIf other people are waiting to meet you, they can feel like they don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nI asked experts why people (OK, me) are late in the first place, and what they can do to change it.\n\nWhy are some people chronically late?\n\nExperts say there are a huge number of reasons why people might be late.\n\nUpbringing: Sade Kelly, a time management coach, says many of her clients either grew up around people who were often late, and therefore developed a lax approach to time, or grew up around people who were overwhelmingly time-conscious. \u201cIf the people in your environment were so on time that you felt restricted and anxious, you want to rebel,\u201d she says.\n\nHow we approach time: another factor is our individual relationship to time. Sirois explains that people have different \u201ctime orientations\u201d. Some are future oriented, or inclined to make decisions based on future plans. This group tends not to be late, Sirois says. Others are more present oriented, and generally make decisions based on what they need in the moment. This group has a greater tendency toward lateness, because they focus less on what\u2019s next. Still others are past oriented, and make their decisions based on past experiences.\n\nAlthough time orientations are seen as fairly stable, Sirois says they\u2019re also fluid; ideally, one will shift through all three. \u201cFlexible time perspective is considered the healthiest,\u201d she says.\n\nFor example, if you are catching up with a friend before an appointment, ideally you would be fully present during your conversation, then orient to the future when it\u2019s time to leave, at which point you could draw on your past experiences to determine the quickest way to travel across town.\n\nOverscheduling: sometimes, people simply have too much on their plate. As Dr Emily Waldum, an adjunct professor of psychology at Campbell University, explains, when we try to juggle too many things at once, certain tasks get delayed or dropped. \u201cWe only have a limited amount of attention. If we are multi-tasking day and night, the best-laid plans can fail simply because we don\u2019t have enough attentional resources left to carry them out successfully,\u201d Waldum says.\n\nAversion: In some cases, people just don\u2019t want to do the task. A client of Kelly\u2019s was consistently late to the same meeting. When Kelly asked him about it, he admitted that he didn\u2019t need to be there, and didn\u2019t want to go. In such cases, Kelly says to review the commitment \u201cand save yourself time, mental space and energy\u201d.\n\nAre lateness and procrastination different?\n\nAversion can also lead to procrastination. It\u2019s tempting to lump together disorganization and procrastination, as they can both result in lateness. But experts say the root causes of the two issues are actually quite different.\n\n\u201cTime management has very little to do with procrastination,\u201d Sirois says. \u201c[Procrastination] has more to do with mood management.\u201d\n\nIf you are procrastinating on a project or on leaving for a meeting, Sirois says it\u2019s important to identify what feelings are coming up. \u201cIt can be an avoidant strategy,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere\u2019s something about doing that task or finishing that task that is threatening to us. It might be that we\u2019re worried that it\u2019s not going to be good enough, or it\u2019s not going to please somebody.\u201d\n\nIf one isn\u2019t able to regulate their mood, Sirois says no amount of time management can make up for that.\n\nHow can people learn to be on time?\n\nEager to fix my own lateness issue, I asked Kelly why it was so hard for some people to be on time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t actually believe it\u2019s hard,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe it\u2019s a developed habit that people can work to overcome.\u201d (I feel disquietingly humbled.)\n\nKelly likes to think of time management as a puzzle, with one\u2019s tasks and activities being the pieces. One way to put together this puzzle is to do what she calls a brain dump. \u201cWhat are all the things on your mind?\u201d she prompts. \u201cWhat are all the things you\u2019re overwhelmed by?\u201d\n\nOnce this is done, prioritize. Consider whether tasks are important, meaning they advance your personal goals; urgent, meaning they have a hard deadline and need to happen in the next week or so; or both. \u201cA lot of times, once we\u2019ve gone through what\u2019s important and what\u2019s urgent, the list starts to shrink,\u201d she says. From there, it\u2019s easier to identify what needs to happen in the next day, week or month, and figure out how much time each task will take.\n\nIt\u2019s important to be realistic about this last step, Kelly says. She mentions a friend who thought it only took 15 to 20 minutes to get ready, but when she timed it, she realized it took an hour and a half. \u201cYou\u2019d be amazed at the things that you think take a short amount of time, but actually take a really long time,\u201d she says.\n\nAlso, identify why you\u2019re late. When I tell Kelly about my tendency to frantically tidy my apartment right when I am supposed to be walking out the door, she suggests that this is an avoidant tendency, and that I am practicing something she calls \u201cproductive procrastination\u201d. And she was right \u2013 it occurred to me that I was folding and refolding blankets in an anxious attempt to delay socializing.\n\nRegardless of your tendencies, Sirois says it\u2019s important to be gentle with yourself. \u201cIt\u2019s a very human thing to struggle with negative feelings about something that pushes you to be late,\u201d says Sirois. \u201cRather than feeling like you\u2019re the worst person in the world for doing that, face up to your emotions and try not to let them consume you.\u201d"

                "text": "At least judging by the press, music festivals are having a tough time. In this economy, they have to court audiences to pay ever higher prices for an ever-more stratified experience; in a post-Beychella era, they\u2019re in a taste war between midlife crisis millennials, Gen Z in their raving prime and the (terrifyingly) ascendant Gen Alpha, the oldest of whom are just old enough to traipse through concert lawns alone. Coachella, North America\u2019s largest and most capital-E Event music festival, failed to sell out its weekend passes for the first time in a decade, prompting premature eulogies and widespread declarations of its flop era.\n\nGovernor\u2019s Ball, New York\u2019s much smaller and far less dusty alternative, fared better. The three-day festival in Queens managed to sell out all of its day passes for a lineup that, should you listen to the largely older indie-heads gloating online, was just as disappointing as the west coast\u2019s signature event, and with the same $16 price for tall boys. Not so at Flushing Meadows Corona Park, which buzzed with enthusiasm for a slate of bold, ultra-confident female pop acts: Sabrina Carpenter, Rene\u00e9 Rapp, newcomer Elyanna, triumphant headliner SZA and, most insistently, pop\u2019s new girl of the moment Chappell Roan.\n\nMusic festivals always skew young, but Gov Ball, being relatively affordable (keyword relative: weekend passes start at $310, compared to Coachella\u2019s $499), open to all ages and accessible via public transit, has a reputation for skewing especially young. As in, pint-sized high-schooler cartoonishly dragging a joint to Friday headliner Post Malone young. (Even the ever-amiable Malone, at 28, seemed to be feeling his age \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t drink as much beer as I used to,\u201d he said while gagging a little on his second foamy one out of his trademark red Solo cup.) But as one \u201cwashed-up\u201d 26-year-old in line for the bathroom put it to me, this year\u2019s Gov Ball wasn\u2019t so much for the teens as it was \u201cfor the girls and the gays\u201d with several queer artists and Pride Month\u2019s beloved Carly Rae Jepsen. \u201cHow are my token straight boyfriends?\u201d Rene\u00e9 Rapp asked during her Sunday set. \u201cYep, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAssumedly even the token straight boyfriends turned out in force for Roan, who has experienced a rapid ascent since opening for Olivia Rodrigo and a statement-making Coachella debut. There was no artist I overheard talked about more this weekend, with more people visibly dressed to see her, as the 26-year-old \u201cmidwest princess\u201d from Missouri, whose Sunday afternoon set \u2013 far from the biggest billing \u2013 drew an overflow crowd.\n\nEmerging from a giant apple dressed as \u201cthe biggest queen of them all\u201d (the Statue of Liberty) in head-to-assless-chaps green, Roan delivered on the hype, even if her mic wasn\u2019t always tuned loud enough to carry over her taxi cab-suited band and the thousands screaming \u201cHOT TO GO!\u201d Wardrobe malfunctions aside, Roan delivered a barn-burner set, called out the White House for inviting her to perform for Pride (\u201cWe want liberty, justice and freedom for all. When you do that, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll come\u201d) and quoted Lady Liberty\u2019s \u201chuddled masses\u201d inscription for trans rights, women\u2019s rights and \u201cfreedom for oppressed people in occupied territories\u201d without directly naming Palestine.\n\nOthers were less coy. Saint Levant, a 23-year-old singer and rapper who was raised in Gaza, dedicated parts of his Sunday performance to the victims of Israeli attacks and spoke openly of his \u201ccomplicated\u201d feelings playing an American festival days after an Israeli attack at a Palestinian refugee camp killed more than 200 people. \u201cI\u2019m here now \u2026 trying to share a moment, trying to celebrate my culture and be here with you, but in the back of my mind all I can think about are these children, these women and these men\u201d he said, to cheers of \u201cfree Palestine!\u201d in a crowd dotted with keffiyehs. \u201cLiberation will come.\u201d\n\nUp-and-coming Palestinian-Chilean singer Elyanna, Coachella\u2019s first all-Arabic-language performer, played her song Olive Branch to a graphic reading \u201cAll Eyes on Rafah\u201d, though the 22-year-old didn\u2019t have a down beat in her entire set; from 2pm until she wrapped 45 minutes later, my jaw was on the floor, on the strength of her siren voice, Shakira-esque dancing and Latin-inflected Arab beats.\n\nBoth Elyanna and Saint Levant are previous Coachella performers bringing their case for stardom eastward; so, too, were this year\u2019s notables Sabrina Carpenter, in a butter-yellow number with a heart-shaped cut-out and sugary confidence to match. Her Saturday set, debuting new single Please Please Please (sans boyfriend and music video star Barry Keoghan), only served to underscore that \u201cthat\u2019s that me espresso\u201d is the line of the summer. Former Sex Lives of College Girls star Rapp, performing on the main stage just after Roan, made the case for a Broadway-to-pop pipeline \u2013 \u201cdon\u2019t talk to me about a crossover!\u201d she said when recalling a male peer who dismissed her songwriting as too \u201ctheatrical\u201d \u2013 with such infectious, unshakeable insouciance that it was impossible not to be charmed.\n\nRapp, less than a year off her first album, was one of several artists to evince the generational divide not unique to Gov Ball, with a crowd heavy on the twentysomethings. Indelible to me is the shock of hearing just how many in that crowd know the lyrics of Roan\u2019s Red Wine Supernova; so, too, is watching a little girl headbang so hard on her dad\u2019s shoulders while listening to the the Killers that she fell off. The Las Vegas-based rock band, celebrating 20 years of Hot Fuss and thus now a legacy act (sorry to elder millennials), reliably delivered a highlight of the weekend on Saturday night, with a classics-heavy set that did not lull once for 90 minutes and which made closer Mr Brightside seem genuinely extraneous."

The festival featured a well-curated lineup and a seamless organization, providing an enjoyable experience with thoughtful food options and a lively atmosphere.

                "source": "nypost",
                "text": "Is John Summit bringing music festivals back to NY?\n\nIn short, yes.\n\nBut let\u2019s start at the beginning.\n\nI attended John Summit\u2019s first-ever Experts Only music festival on Randall\u2019s Island \u2014 and honestly, I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun I had. Scratch that: I had the time of my life.\n\nMy Experts Only weekend kicked off with a surprise pop-up at Vessel in Hudson Yards on Friday\u2013 an event my friends and I dubbed \u201cone of the most civilized pop-ups\u201d we\u2019ve ever been to.\n\nAt this surprise event, the 31-year-old DJ teamed up with Lululemon for a special Experts Only run that allowed special entry to the first 400 fans at their 5th Avenue location. Fans that gained access were treated to a pop-up concert and Lululemon gear following a run with Summit himself. Following Fred Again\u2019s chaotic NYC scavenger hunt pop-up in June, this was a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe pop-up\u2019s seemingly effortless organization and seamless roll-out foreshadowed just how the rest of the impressive weekend would play out.\n\nSummit, a Chicago native now based in Miami, is no stranger to big stages. He\u2019s a regular at fan-favorite venues like Club Space and LIV Miami, and his sets at Miami staples like Ultra and III Points (among many other reasons) have cemented him as a force in house music. But, despite those roots, he chose to launch his own festival right here in The City That Never Sleeps.\n\nWhen The Post last spoke with Summit just a few weeks before Experts Only, he admitted that he wanted to fill a major gap: New York\u2019s lack of house-focused festivals. With Electric Zoo in limbo, Brooklyn Mirage facing setbacks, and nightlife in general feeling more all over the place than ever before, the city\u2019s house fans were overdue for a proper gathering.\n\nAnd, naturally, the always-reliable businessman turned turntablist delivered.\n\nAs someone who lives for live concerts, house music, and outdoor venues, this festival felt like a reminder of how fun and refreshing a well-executed music event can be. The last festival I attended was Gov Ball, which, of course, is a totally different experience, but Experts Only blew me away. Even as a house-only event, it felt personal and flawless, but not in a scrappy and overwhelming way. You know, like a great DJ set.\n\nFor my money, that\u2019s something most NYC festivals (and festivals in general!) often get wrong. Too many times I\u2019ve found myself at events that feel overcrowded, gimmicky, or like a giant ad with branding activations shoved in your face. Experts Only, of course, had sponsors, but they were integrated tastefully. Nothing distracted from the music or the laid-back atmosphere.\n\nThe Experts Only\u2019s lineup, curated by John Summit himself and produced by Relentless Beats and Medium Rare, was well-curated with a balance of chill house and more intense sets, featuring artists like LP Giobbi, Kaskade performing B2B with Cassian and Green Velvet alongside Layton Giordani fit together perfectly. One might even say they\u2026only\u2026booked\u2026experts. Sorry, we couldn\u2019t help ourselves.\n\nThe overall energy was truly immaculate and so many factors played into that. The weather was for a lack of a better term *chef\u2019s kiss* and left me believing that mid-September might actually be the best time for a festival. Plus, the crowd was \u201cmama bear\u201d (just right). I never felt packed in or overwhelmed by pushing concertgoers and you could watch the mainstage from pretty much any angle. So clutch.\n\nEven the food options felt thoughtfully chosen and, as a self-proclaimed foodie, this went a long way for elevating the experience. Instead of the standard Big Mozz and generic beer garden options, the festival leaned into NYC staples like Prince Street Pizza, Gotham Social Burger, matcha, and even boba which I didn\u2019t expect but honestly? I\u2019m here for it.\n\nAs for the location, logistically, Randall\u2019s Island was a bit of a mixed bag. Personally, I had a smooth experience thanks to the dedicated Experts Only ferry service catering to attendees who bought passes for the boat that ran approximately every 20 minutes. But not everyone felt the same. TikTok lit up with complaints from festival-goers who were forced to walk back across the bridge to Manhattan once Ubers were cut off before the festival ended. Definitely a hiccup worth fixing if the festival comes back for year two.\n\nStill, overall, I felt safe, free to roam, and fully immersed in the festival. By far the highlight of the night was Summit closing out his set with a remix of his magnetic new hit \u201cCrystallized.\u201d The dubstep remix at the end had my soul leaving my body \u2014 and judging by the crowd\u2019s reaction and social media commentary, I wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nSo\u2026 is John Summit bringing music festivals back to NYC? After Experts Only, the answer feels like a confident yes. Festivals like this are exactly what the city has been missing.\n\nWell done, John \u2014 you deserve your flowers. Same time next year?\n\nWe promise we\u2019ll be there if you are.\n\nJohn Summit tour schedule 2025\n\nSummit isn\u2019t resting on his laurels after Experts Only.\n\nHere all of his upcoming tour dates, the venues he\u2019s performing at and links to buy tickets.\n\nJohn Summit set list\n\nThe prolific performer delivered not one but two sets on Sept. 21.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to see what he took to the stage on Sunday, here\u2019s a closer look at what made the cut at his pair of gigs (including \u201cCrystallized,\u201d which popped up in the second set), according to Set List FM.\n\nSet One\n\nSet Two\n\nEDM stars on tour in 2025\n\nBummed you missed Experts Only and have a hankering for house, bass, trance or even dubstep?\n\nWe\u2019re here to help.\n\nHere are just five artists you won\u2019t want to miss when they\u2019re out and about these next few months.\n\n\u2022 Justice with Kaytranada\n\n\u2022 Dom Dolla\n\n\u2022 Disclosure\n\n\u2022 Sammy Virji\n\n\u2022 Mau P"

So please take this as both spoiler and content warning, and don\u2019t blame me if you feel like your eyeballs need cleaning after seeing it.\n\nBill Whitney (Billy Warlock) seems to have it all: he\u2019s popular, has a steady girlfriend and is captain of his high school basketball team (despite being the shortest basketball player I\u2019ve ever seen). But something about Bill\u2019s life seems \u201coff\u201d.\n\nHis family starts behaving secretively, he is plagued by night terrors and he comes to realise that his perfect life is merely artifice. He questions his own sanity when he accidentally walks in on his sister Jenny (Patrice Jennings) twisting her body into contorted and unnatural positions. But events finally come to a head when Bill\u2019s school friend Blanchard (Tim Bartell) plays him an audio recording of his family discussing their disturbingly homicidal and inappropriately sexual weekend plans.\n\nBill confides his fears to his therapist Dr Cleveland (Ben Slack) who suggests he is having paranoid delusions. But to quote Joseph Heller: \u201cJust because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not after you.\u201d\n\nShortly afterwards, Blanchard turns up dead.\n\nSoon enough, Bill uncovers a wide-reaching conspiracy involving his social circle. When he finally confronts them at an opulent party, their true nature is revealed as an ancient species who have always lived among us. They prey upon the lower class in a grotesque ritual known as The Shunt.\n\nThe rich partygoers meld into one another in a writhing mass of slippery limbs and unidentified orifices. It\u2019s not \u201ceat the rich\u201d but the rich eating us: they feast upon their captives in a deranged orgy of sex and gluttony. It\u2019s a conclusion straight from the mind of Japanese special effects wizard Screaming Mad George \u2013 whose credits also include Predator and several Nightmare on Elm Street entries.\n\nSociety\u2019s conclusion may be twisted, but the film portrays the affluent as seedy, entitled and repellent even before they turn into a living sludge. The soundtrack\u2019s use of the deeply irritating Eton Boating Song is a masterstroke; its moneyed pomp subliminally grates your every last nerve.\n\nAlong the way there\u2019s also a classic portrait of typical teenage alienation as Bill struggles with the fact he has nothing in common with his family. His feeble angst and soap opera good looks stoke the mildest rebellion of all: as a rich kid out of step with his privilege.\n\nBut it\u2019s the bizarre and paranoid conspiracy at Society\u2019s heart that is often overlooked. It\u2019s unsettling, oddball and downright Lynchian; characters such as the big-haired, perpetually zonked-out Mrs Carlyn \u2013 the mother of Bill\u2019s love interest \u2013 or the manipulative Dr Cleveland feel as if they would be right at home in Twin Peaks. Yuzna probes the Beverly Hills elite with a Blue Velvet-esque determination to scratch the veneer of perfect \u201cnormal life\u201d and take a look at the beetles and creepy crawlies lurking in its rotted undercarriage.\n\nComing out of the decadent 80s, Society\u2019s message is certainly not new or subtle, but it does feel more relevant than ever. The rich are slowly devouring us all \u2013 so where is Billy Warlock when we need him?"

                "text": "The first song I fell in love with\n\nI would sing Hit The Road Jack by Ray Charles in my room when I was about 10. I had it on cassette, and wanted to learn every lyric so I could sing it to the end and get all the bits right.\n\nThe first album I bought\n\nThe soundtrack to Footloose on cassette from HMV on Cuba Street in Wellington. I\u2019m a big fan of the movie and wanted to be a dancer when I was a kid, so this really hit the spot.\n\nThe song I do at karaoke\n\nI\u2019ve tried to do the odd hip-hop track like The Real Slim Shady by Eminem. One minute you\u2019re like: I\u2019ve got the flow on! Then it backfires because you realise: I don\u2019t know all the words. Also, hip-hop just sounds terrible in a New Zealand accent. Really, you want a song that people can also sing along, so you\u2019re not on your own, like Don\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over by Crowded House.\n\nThe best song to play at a party\n\nHaving A Party by the Osmonds is so good, with an undeniably banging good-time chorus, but you need to make sure that the party is rocking before you play it. You don\u2019t want that going when the first person\u2019s arrived.\n\nThe song I can no longer listen to\n\nI used to love Word Up! by Cameo, but now it annoys me too much. It\u2019s good for about 30 seconds.\n\nThe song I secretly like but tell everyone I hate\n\nI\u2019m pretty honest so I don\u2019t secretly love any songs. I\u2019d probably never chose to put on Taylor Swift, but I\u2019m happy when daughter puts on Lover. I secretly like it, although it sounds a lot like Heartbeats by The Knife to me.\n\nThe best to have sex to\n\nHappy Birthday.\n\nThe song that changed my life\n\nHeart of Gold by Neil Young is the first song I ever learned because it\u2019s only a few chords and easy to play, so it began my journey into playing guitar. I could sit on my guitar and strum on it all day, so it\u2019s been a big part of my life.\n\nThe song that gets me up in the morning\n\nI like to start my days pretty chill with something like Call The Days by this magical New Zealand singer songwriter called Nadia Reid.\n\nThe song that makes me cry\n\nMy father passed away two years ago and at his funeral, we played Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond during this uplifting photo montage. Now, I can\u2019t listen to it without thinking about my dad in a nice but sad way.\n\nThe song I\u2019d like played at my funeral\n\nWe\u2019ll Meet Again by Vera Lynn, because I like the sense of the farewell not being the end."

I don\u2019t discriminate for any reason, whether it be country or anything,\u201d he said of the two Americans and the Northern Irish McIlroy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get starstruck easily when it comes to musicians or actors because I\u2019m around that world a bit. But this is different because I watch these guys on a normal basis,\u201d added DelGuidice, who loved their appearances in \u201cHappy Gilmore 2.\u201d\n\nDelGuidice, a devout Mets fan, compared his opportunity to what it would be like singing in front of the crowd during the Amazins\u2019 1986 World Series championship.\n\nAnd, while he has shot on some of the island\u2019s most iconic courses like Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, he has yet to try Bethpage Black, which features a bold-faced warning sign at the first tee box for its notorious, PGA-level difficulty.\n\n\u201cAfter this, I think I\u2019m going to have to try my luck at it.\u201d\n\nBetter on the back nine\n\nIt has also been a long time coming for the 54-year-old dad of four, who persevered through hard times at the start of his music journey.\n\n\u201cRight off the bat \u2014 just struggle, struggle, struggle. I was living in a motor home in my friend\u2019s backyard. I just got divorced\u2026so there was a lot of \u2018when are you going to give up the dream? You\u2019re never going to make it in music,'\u201d DelGuidice said of his 20s.\n\n\u201cI just wouldn\u2019t bend. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an Italian thing or a Long Island thing, or if it\u2019s a genetic thing \u2014 You can\u2019t tell me I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe big break started to come while DelGuidice was two years into running an LI based Billy Joel cover band, which caught the attention of the famous Hicksville native himself in 2002.\n\nThey bonded over music, sharing the stage from time to time for the next decade, and in 2013, Joel asked DelGuidice a life-changing question during a rehearsal at the Paramount Theater in Huntington.\n\n\u201cHe stood up and he\u2019s walking away from the piano and he says, \u2018I want to talk to Mike\u2019\u2026A couple of the people started gathering to hear what was going on, and he said, \u2018No, I only want to talk to Mike alone.'\u201d\n\nJust like that, DelGuidice, now happily remarried, formally joined Joel\u2019s ranks and was wavin\u2019 the bad times goodbye.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of that moment wasn\u2019t even \u2018oh wow, I\u2019m getting to play with Billy Joel,\u2019 it was an affirmation and a confirmation over everyone who said I couldn\u2019t do this,\u201d added the musician, who was shaking with nerves when given the honor.\n\nDriving fore-ward\n\nNobody was more excited than Joel to learn that DelGuidice was selected to belt out the \u201cStar Spangled Banner\u201d as the Piano Man posted a \u201cproud\u201d photo of his colleague to Instagram earlier in the month.\n\nDelGuidice said that he and Joel are of one mind in how the anthem should be properly performed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had many conversations about it. We\u2019re both purists, so I approach the anthem in a very purist way,\u201d said DelGuidice, who recently released a new single, \u201cKilling Me,\u201d and actively performs independently across LI and the nation as well.\n\nHe has opted to sing a cappella, although it is the most challenging rendition, which DelGuidice said is absolutely make or break on the very first note.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be any finagling of the melody or, you know, doing any of the Whitney Houston stuff\u2026it\u2019s such a patriotic thing. You want to do it right, you want to do it justice,\u201d he said, adding that the thousands in attendance are welcome to join in \u2014 and that Houston knocked it out of the park during her iconic Super Bowl XXV rendition.\n\nThe time DelGuidice has spent on stage together with Joel has also inadvertently helped him prepare for this moment, where the whole world will be watching.\n\nDuring shows, DelGuidice would sing the operatic aria \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d to lead into the hit \u201cScenes From an Italian Restaurant\u201d \u2014 all because Joel loved a YouTube version he posted years ago.\n\nLike with the upcoming anthem, DelGuidice had a pit in his stomach to jump from 80s rock to a track profoundly done by Luciano Pavarotti in front of thousands \u2014 but just as he plans to shortly, DelGuidice rose to the occasion.\n\n\u201cThis is the moment \u2014 just try to stay in it and start on the right note,\u201d he said, adding what an honor it is to represent the stars and stripes.\n\n\u201cDeliver it, just deliver it, and just get through it \u2014 and try not to drop dead of a heart attack midway through,\u201d DelGuidice joked."

                "text": "It is the beginning of August and a crowd is gathered on the deck of the American Princess cruise boat waiting for one thing \u2013 and they are not disappointed. Suddenly, a juvenile humpback whale, known as NYC0318 in local records, bursts through the surface of the water, engulfing thousands of small, oily fish.\n\nFor those onboard the 29-metre (95ft) vessel, the scene is a thrill to watch, in part because it is taking place not far out at sea but just off the coast of Manhattan, New York. Among the tourists watching is Chris St Lawrence, a naturalist and the communications director of Gotham Whale, a volunteer-run marine research organisation in the city. He is not just looking out for the whales, he is watching for danger around them.\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re feeding, they can get really distracted, and they don\u2019t care about boats,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen Gotham Whale began tracking humpbacks in 2012, its NYC humpback catalogue contained just five individuals. Today, it includes 470 whales \u2013 mostly transient juveniles such as NYC0318 drawn by the rich feeding opportunities of the New York Bight. But with the hunt for such bounty comes a growing problem.\n\nWhat was once a marine highway connecting southern breeding grounds to northern feeding areas has, since 2010, become a regular foraging destination, putting humpbacks on a collision course with maritime traffic.\n\nCargo vessels, tankers, cruise ships, fishing boats and recreational craft all cross humpback feeding grounds in the New York Bight \u2013 an area roughly the size of Switzerland, stretching from southern New Jersey to eastern Long Island and offshore to the Hudson Canyon, a deep submarine valley.\n\nDanielle Brown, research director at Gotham Whale, says: \u201cI don\u2019t think people realise they are out there, and these shipping companies certainly don\u2019t expect to see them.\u201d\n\nLesley Thorne, a marine scientist at Stony Brook University on Long Island, says several factors are converging dangerously: recovering humpback populations, potential climate-related shifts in their food, and whales venturing into shipping corridors to feed. \u201cIt is this perfect storm of events,\u201d she says.\n\nSince the end of commercial whaling, humpbacks have become a conservation success story. In 2016, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) delisted the whales in New York waters (considered as part of the West Indies population) under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nBut that same year, large whale strandings along the US east coast began to rise, prompting Noaa to declare an Unusual Mortality Event in 2017 that remains open today.\n\nThorne\u2019s 2024 research found vessel strikes to be the main cause, although fishing gear entanglements played a part.\n\nThe New York Bight hosts an extraordinary array of endangered whales: blue, fin, sei, sperm and North Atlantic right whales. In 2024, researchers documented critically endangered North Atlantic right whales near Hudson Canyon, close to busy shipping lanes.\n\nIn May that year, a cruise ship arrived at a New York port with a dead endangered sei whale draped on its bow. The common draw is food, but humpback feeding behaviour compounds the risk.\n\n\u201cWe see surface aggregations of menhaden [herring-like fish] that are really close to shore, and we have almost exclusively juvenile whales feeding in these really nearshore waters, as shallow as 15ft [5 metres] of water,\u201d says Thorne. \u201cThe combination of surface feeding and shallow waters likely makes them more vulnerable to vessel strikes.\u201d\n\nGotham Whale\u2019s research documents the toll, showing whales with vessel strike scars and deep propeller wounds. One case this year involved a healthy humpback observed one day bearing fresh strike injuries only days later in the same area.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s fastest-warming ocean regions, changing conditions may be drawing more whales closer to shore to feed.\n\nJanet Coit, who was Noaa\u2019s assistant administrator for fisheries under the Biden administration, says: \u201cThe scientists out of our Northeast Fisheries Science Center were clear that warming waters are affecting the productivity of the ocean and bringing more whales in closer to shore, which is causing greater interactions with vessels and more vessel strikes.\u201d\n\nThe remedy \u2013 to reroute vessels or slow them down \u2013 is clear but not easily achieved. \u201cWith three shipping lanes into New York, there is no opportunity to reroute vessels,\u201d says Samantha Rosen, a spokesperson for the New York State environmental conservation department.\n\nStudies show that reducing ship speeds to 10 knots (12mph) decreases strike likelihood and lethality. Currently, vessels 20 metres or longer must travel no faster than 10 knots from January to May in seasonal management areas, including around major ports. However, in January 2025, the Noaa withdrew proposed vessel speed rule expansions that would have better protected large whales year-round by expanding protections to larger areas, longer time periods and smaller vessels.\n\nThe revisions, aimed at reducing risks to right whales, would also have helped other large whales, says Thorne. But resistance from mariners and lawmakers has hindered Noaa\u2019s proposal, says Coit. Meanwhile, voluntary slowdowns triggered when whales are detected have limited effectiveness.\n\nThe regulatory setback coincides with significant cuts to Noaa\u2019s funding, staffing and climate research programmes since January.\n\nWhen the US enacted wildlife protection laws in the 1970s, Coit says there was a moral ethic around saving whales and conservation. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that this ethic is not underpinning our values any more,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIf people want to save the whales, they are going to have to change their behaviour.\u201d"

Women fishing their SeaPass cards out of their bras, turning a simple card swipe into a full-on nautical contortion act.\n\nThe Reddit thread, cheekily titled \u201cLadies \u2014 Get a lanyard,\u201d didn\u2019t hold back: \u201cI\u2019m currently on Independence of the Seas and twice I\u2019ve seen ladies reaching into their blouses to locate their SeaPass, which was stashed in their bras.\u201d\n\nThe poster continued with some pointed advice: \u201cThis is frankly disgusting for the crew members and for everyone who has them touch their drink glasses afterward. Please just buy a lanyard.\u201d\n\nOthers pushed back, trying to keep it chill: \u201cIt\u2019s not classy, but you need to calm down. It\u2019s just skin, just like the skin on your hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cSweat. I have held my phone there.

Boob sweat is the very least of your worries, my guy.\u201d\n\nPractical solutions were also suggested, with a side of fashion critique. Read one suggestion, \u201c\u2018Dear clothing designers, why don\u2019t you make pockets in clothing for women so they don\u2019t need to use their bra?\u2019 There. Fixed it for you.\u201d\n\nAnother added, \u201cBras need pockets. I said what I said.\u201d\n\nTech-friendly cruisers had their own take on the dilemma: \u201cFrom the perspective of customer-centricity, it would be better for cruise lines to offer NFC wrist bands (in addition to cards). Give customers a choice. I\u2019d personally find a lanyard incredibly annoying.\u201d\n\nOne user agreed, I\u2019m not a fan of lanyards (I hate when they bounce/sway, which also may just be because I\u2019m a woman, but it\u2019s still annoying). Our themed cruise last year even provided them for every passenger, but I opted not to use it. I\u2019d much rather deal with a wristband.\u201d\n\nAnd for the ultra-digital crowd, convenience is key: \u201cLet me put it in my Apple Wallet.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported by The Post, the high seas have always been a hot spot for social media kerfuffles over cruise-ship manners.\n\nLast year, one TikToker named Jessica (aka @Jesstravel7) slammed the practice of reserving a pool deck chair on a cruise after spotting row upon row of deck chairs hogged with towels.\n\nShe called out what she believed to be one of cruise etiquette\u2019s biggest ongoing offenses.\n\n\u201cThis is what you call entitlement on a cruise ship; saving all these pool chairs,\u201d she said.\n\nOnboard Royal Caribbean\u2019s Utopia of the Seas, she pleaded with fellow cruisers: don\u2019t stash towels on pool chairs if you\u2019re not actually swimming.\n\nThis ignited a debate on what an \u201centitled cruiser\u201d really means and who it refers to.\n\nAt the end of the day, whether it\u2019s bra-stashed SeaPasses or towel-hoarding deck chairs, it seems the real rough waters on a cruise aren\u2019t the waves \u2014 they\u2019re your fellow passengers\u2019 bad manners."

His genuine talent and the support of his family, particularly sister Bindi, have made him a standout figure in the competition, appealing to a broad audience.",
                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "The long-running reality TV competition Dancing With the Stars has developed a rep as a reputation-rehabilitation show, which is somewhat removed from its original pitch of \u201cimagine if we made celebrities dance for our amusement like little performing monkeys\u201d.\n\nPerforming on Dancing With the Stars can generate massive amounts of goodwill for even the most benighted celebrity. In the US, controversial casting includes celebrity chef Paula Deen, who appeared on the show two years after making headlines for using racial slurs; pro boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr, who was trying to dance past his domestic violence convictions; and Olivia Jade Giannulli of college-admissions-scandal infamy. Even controversial political figures have attempted to pirouette away from their unpopular public personas, including former Trump staffer Sean Spicer in 2018, and Pauline Hanson on the Australian version in 2004. Not everyone comes out squeaky clean, but at least it\u2019s a good distraction.\n\nThe reason Dancing With the Stars is so effective as reputation rehab is down to our inherent fear about being seen dancing in public. The risk celebrities take in doing the show at all \u2013 let alone doing it WELL \u2013 is rewarded by a potent mix of public adulation and relief.\n\nAnd if Dancing With the Stars can do that for disgraced celebrities, it\u2019s no surprise that audiences are going wild after the success of the universally beloved Robert Irwin. The 21-year-old conservationist and scion of Australia\u2019s wildlife-wrangling Irwin family made his DWTS debut on the 34th season of the US series on 16 September, with a performance that judge Derek Hough called \u201cthe best first dance I have ever seen on the show\u201d \u2013 and which scored 15/20, tying for top of the leaderboard.\n\nChannelling more than a little Hugh-Jackman-in-Boy-from-Oz aesthetic, wearing a camp sparkly jungle outfit, Irwin \u2013 with dance partner, Witney Carson \u2013 performed a very energetic jive to Steppenwolf\u2019s Born to Be Wild. Not only did he showcase the same energy and enthusiasm he uses to wrestle crocodiles and wrangle snakes, but he danced extremely well, despite having, in his words, \u201cnever moved to music in my life\u201d before joining the show.\n\nIt\u2019s almost a shame that Irwin doesn\u2019t have a scandal he\u2019s trying to make everyone forget \u2013 although to be fair, the Dancing With the Stars salary is really incentive enough.\n\nAfter his performance, he ran to the side of the stage and hugged sister Bindi in a seemingly very authentic show of emotion. Bindi is not only another beloved and unproblematic Australian celebrity, but also won Dancing With the Stars herself in 2015. Once you also factor in the general goodwill that Australia and the world have for the Irwin family as a whole, including the tragically deceased Steve Irwin, you have literally a publicist\u2019s dream scenario. You could even say Robert is just the latest person to benefit from the American obsession with Australia that began back in the 80s with Crocodile Dundee; as long as he continues to conform to the Australian-larrikin-who-wrestles-animals image, the world will be his oyster. I don\u2019t want to cynically imply it\u2019s fake or staged \u2013 only that after lapping up some of the more desperate narratives from various B-list crooks and weirdos, DWTS audiences are loving such an unproblematic and wholesome reality TV narrative.\n\n\u201cThat was not planned,\u201d a visibly tearing-up Robert Irwin told a reporter from Entertainment Tonigh, about his hug with Bindi at the end of his performance. \u201cBindi said \u2018this will feel like flying\u2019 \u2013 and now I know that feeling \u2026 it meant a lot. It was super cool.\u201d\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, in the lead-up to the DWTS premiere, Irwin posted footage of him practising his routine with his four-year-old niece, Grace Warrior, that probably blew up ovaries all around the world like a string of super volcanoes.\n\nIrwin has also captured the other key audience of a dancing-reality show: his recent steamy Bonds underwear campaign has endeared him forever to the gays and other horny parties. Maintaining a wholesome public image while posing in your underwear with a big snake is a delicate and fraught balancing act, too.\n\nReality shows are built on narratives \u2013 the redemption arc is only one of the most popular. Following in the footsteps of his already famous family, Robert Irwin is opting into a much rarer narrative: being genuinely likable and surprisingly talented. He\u2019s Australia\u2019s good boy."

He noted the \u201cStand by Me\u201d actor was struggling with choreography and that the entire experience was out of his comfort zone.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget this production is not just about you and your partner dancing, it\u2019s about this massive behemoth of everything that\u2019s happening \u2014 the amount of people that you have to deal with, the amount of interviews, and this is all between your rehearsal time and your therapy, and you are trying to lick your wounds and all that stuff,\u201d he shared.\n\nStill, he had faith in Johnson\u2019s abilities as a \u201ctough coach.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat show requires you to be able to tell grown people what to do and stand your ground,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think Jenna will get it done.\u201d\n\nBoth Johnson and her husband, fellow \u201cDWTS\u201d pro Val Chmerkovskiy, are allegedly \u201cmiserable\u201d this season with their partners, a source also told the outlet.\n\nVal is paired with influencer Alix Earle.\n\n\u201cVal and Jenna are miserable but they have been specifically warned by producers: \u2018we don\u2019t complain about our celebrity participants,'\u201d the insider said.\n\nReps for Johnson and Val didn\u2019t immediately respond to Page Six\u2019s request for comment.\n\nJohnson and Feldman received low scores for their tango on the season premiere of \u201cDWTS\u201d last week, receiving a score of 9 out of 20 from judges Derek Hough and Bruno Tonioli.\n\nJohnson \u2014 who won the mirrorball trophy last season with \u201cBachelor\u201d star Joey Graziadei \u2014 previously hinted at issues with Feldman.

                "text": "On his way to a remote industrial zone at the edge of Istanbul, Adnan Khan compares it to something out of Mad Max. Packs of wild dogs roam around desolate wastelands; toxic chemicals spill out into the street, with corrugated metal sheets and \u201cslapdash factories\u201d scattered around. \u201cIt\u2019s like a shantytown,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, once he sets foot inside some of these factories, he reaches for a different cinematic comparison. This time he\u2019s thinking of the torture-horror film Saw, as he witnesses Afghan refugees working and living in conditions that he says fit the UN definition of modern-day slavery.\n\nKhan, a journalist, had been visiting three young men working in a factory \u2013 Samim, Hayat and Khalid \u2013 every week as he researched a story about refugee workers in the recycling industry. Then one day in 2022, Hayat asked Khan: \u201cDid you hear what happened to Arifullah Fazli?\u201d He showed Khan a photo on his phone of a young man who worked in a different factory. It was a harrowing image: a lifeless body, legs missing, laid out on the floor surrounded by piles of trash. He had been killed in an accident involving a recycling compactor machine.\n\n\u201cThe moment I was shown his body was such a shock,\u201d says Khan. \u201cThe story became much bigger.\u201d\n\nThe ensuing investigation has resulted in a three-part podcast series, Boy Wasted. It is produced by the team behind the BBC\u2019s award-winning investigative podcast, Buried, and published by the environmental news title ENDS Report and the Dutch magazine De Groene Amsterdammer. It reveals that Afghan refugees are not only being exploited by unscrupulous recycling factory owners, living in fear of deportation with no power or agency and working in perilous conditions \u2013 they are also dying at alarming rates while sorting through our rubbish. The UK exports thousands of tonnes of plastic waste to Turkey every year.\n\n\u201cWe thought we were looking into one mysterious body,\u201d says Dan Ashby, one of the podcast\u2019s producers and hosts, along with Lucy Taylor and Khan. \u201cBut what emerged was a whole broken system that is full of criminality and death.\u201d\n\nAs part of the investigation, the organisation \u0130S\u0130G Meclisi, which tracks workplace deaths in Turkey, carried out the first ever analysis of workplace deaths in Turkish recycling. It revealed deeply troubling findings. The researchers discovered that two people are crushed, ripped or burned to death in the recycling sector every month, and this has been the case for the last decade.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it when these numbers started coming out,\u201d says Ashby. \u201cMore than 200 boys and men have died in the last 10 years. So it then became an inquiry into: what are we doing with our plastic? What kind of workplaces is this enabling? What kind of organised crime is there?\u201d\n\nThe rubbish industry is a huge one. \u201cBritain\u2019s biggest export is waste,\u201d says Ashby. \u201cThat\u2019s what we make the most of now.\u201d It has become so vast and profitable \u2013 and in many cases unregulated and unchecked \u2013 that one Environment Agency worker who features in the podcast describes it as being like \u201cthe wild west\u201d and says that \u201cwaste crime is the new narcotics\u201d. It\u2019s a mammoth task to tackle.\n\n\u201cA fifth of UK waste now passes through criminal hands,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cI\u2019m sure the Environment Agency are doing everything they can with the resources they have, but there are only five full-time officers checking all the waste coming out of England\u2019s ports.\u201d Approximately 9m waste containers pass through UK ports every year, but only 0.02% are being inspected. \u201cSo when that waste arrives in Istanbul and isn\u2019t what it\u2019s supposed to be, it\u2019s passed on to more and more dodgy smaller businesses,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t have to do what they should do with it because no one\u2019s checking.\u201d\n\nSince China banned plastic waste imports in 2018, Turkey has become a top destination for exports of plastic, with more illegal factories popping up to meet demand. There have already been reports that this plastic ends up being burned instead of recycled.\n\nBoy Wasted unearths a sinister picture of the human cost. It looks into cover-ups, payoffs and bribes, as well as a widespread indifference to the deaths of refugees, who, Khan says, are treated as \u201csubhuman\u201d and like animals. \u201cEverybody is aware and it\u2019s totally in the open,\u201d he adds. \u201cOne boss literally said to me at a recycling facility: \u2018My business wouldn\u2019t survive without these people. We need the cheap labour for this industry to survive.\u2019\u201d Some of the undocumented workers work 14- to 16-hour days and live in storage cupboards inside the factories, with no access to running water or toilets.\n\nThe industry is so reliant on exploiting this workforce that companies budget for compensation money to be paid to their families in the event of their deaths. In the podcast, Asl\u0131 Odman of \u0130S\u0130G Meclisi refers to this as \u201cblood money\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s accounted for in businesses,\u201d says Ashby. \u201cThe idea that you don\u2019t pay insurance or you don\u2019t get safe equipment because it\u2019s cheaper just to lose lives \u2026 that is such gross negligence and awful callousness towards human life that I can\u2019t even think of a word for it.\u201d Odman does find the word for it, though. \u201cI think we have the right to call it murder,\u201d she says in the series.\n\nThe podcast is an arresting and horrific insight into the link between consumption, waste and the loss of human life. It\u2019s also a story that Ashby feels is especially timely. \u201cWith the great dehumanising of refugees in Europe and Britain that is going on, we\u2019ve set out to humanise these people and to inhabit their world every single part of the way,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope even if listeners don\u2019t care about plastic and the environment, it might be interesting from that perspective.\u201d\n\nAside from conveying empathy during a time of widespread cruelty, there\u2019s also a searing environmental message burned into the show. \u201cBy sending so much dodgy waste out into the world, we are creating this system,\u201d says Ashby. \u201cWe enable the deaths of refugees. Not just Britain \u2013 there\u2019s other countries as well \u2013 but Britain is one of the biggest exporters to Turkey. They call it \u2018waste colonialism\u2019, and no longer can we just send out our toxicities to the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue with creating this enormous tide of plastic. This is a scandal hiding in plain sight and we cannot turn a blind eye.\u201d"

                "text": "Britain\u2019s puddings are under threat. According to research from English Heritage, only 2% of British households eat a daily homemade dessert, while a third never bake, boil or steam one at all.\n\n\u201cSweet puddings are closely intertwined with British history and it would be a huge shame for them to die out,\u201d said the charity\u2019s senior curator of history, Dr Andrew Hann. But he went on to suggest that, at the current rate of decline, the British pudding will be extinct in 50 years.\n\nLeaving aside complex questions about what does and doesn\u2019t constitute a British pudding \u2013 we know an apple crumble is one, and a Calippo isn\u2019t \u2013 we must ask ourselves why we\u2019ve stopped producing old-fashioned cooked desserts. Do we lack the time, or the skill \u2013 or both? Have tastes changed? Have certain classic puddings simply faded from Britain\u2019s collective memory?\n\nI can\u2019t answer that last one \u2013 I\u2019m American. I\u2019ve been exposed to many British puddings over the years, but I have no history with them, or nostalgia for them. To remedy this, I tried cooking 10 of Britain\u2019s endangered puddings, in an attempt to find out which, if any, are worthy of a rescue effort, and which may deserve their approaching extinction.\n\nJam roly-poly\n\nI\u2019ve never eaten a jam roly-poly, AKA shirt-sleeve pudding, AKA dead man\u2019s arm. My adult British children reckon they have had it for school dinners, but they were as surprised as I was by the recipe, especially the generous amount of beef suet. Suet, the fat around the kidneys of the animal, is commonly available in a fairly inoffensive, pelleted form. There is a vegetable version, but I stuck with the original.\n\nI watched chef Aaron Middleton\u2019s video tutorial, because I figured there would be some technique to master, but the dough itself is basic: self-raising flour, butter, suet, sugar, milk. Once it comes together, you flatten it into a large rectangle, slather the whole thing in raspberry jam, roll it up and pinch the ends.\n\nThis assembly is then wrapped in a parcel of greaseproof paper and foil, and steamed in the oven, with a roasting tin full of boiling water sitting on the rack below.\n\nThe most generous thing I could say about my first jam roly-poly is that it let me down: it didn\u2019t rise; it didn\u2019t form a crust; it didn\u2019t, to be honest, come out of the oven looking materially different from when I put it in. If I were being less generous, I would also add that it was disgusting \u2013 claggy, sickly sweet and still raw in places. Something went wrong, and I\u2019m not sure what. I forced a slice on my middle son and dared him to be complimentary.\n\n\u201cYou can really taste the suet,\u201d he said.\n\nRating (1 being the least palatable/hardest to make, and 5 the nicest/easiest): taste: 1; ease: 1\n\nSussex pond pudding\n\nI followed Mary Berry\u2019s recipe for this timeless British pudding that I\u2019ve never heard of; you have to wonder if the name isn\u2019t a big part of the problem. Sussex pond pudding is made with apples, muscovado sugar and, yes, more suet. It also has a whole lemon at its heart, which I guess you\u2019re supposed to cut around when you serve it. But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nIt employs a similar dough to the one for the jam roly-poly that failed me so badly, though perhaps this one is a little drier. The apples are peeled, cored, diced into cubes and mixed with cold butter and sugar. You also need a pudding basin of about 1.5 litres capacity, or around 20cm diameter across the top.\n\nThe basin is thoroughly buttered, the dough rolled out into a 30cm circle. Slice out one quarter of it \u2013 from noon to 3pm, say \u2013 and reserve. The remainder should fit snugly into the contours of your pudding bowl. Spoon a bit of the apple, butter and sugar mixture into the bottom of the pastry lining. Pierce the lemon all over with a fork or cocktail stick and sit it upright in the mixture. Surround that with more apples, and then turn your reserved dough into a circular lid.\n\nI had to watch a video of a guy sealing and tying his pudding bowl for steaming several times \u2013 it\u2019s complicated \u2013 but you fashion a covering from a layer of greaseproof paper and one of foil, with a pleat down the middle for expansion. Then, you tie string tightly round the edge (pudding basins have a pronounced lip for this purpose), create a handle from more string, and trim off the excess foil. The resulting parcel is pretty impressive \u2013 if only one was allowed to stop there.\n\nThis package goes into a big pan with a tight-fitting lid, with boiling water poured halfway up the sides of the bowl. Simmer with the lid on for \u2013 get this \u2013 three-and-a-half hours, topping up the water as needed.\n\nAs soon as it\u2019s cool enough, invert over a plate; you should end up with a crusty dome surrounding an apple pie filling. And a lemon.\n\nI used to think I understood what the word stodgy meant in a culinary context, but the Sussex pond pudding has reset my frame of reference. This is, by some measure, the heaviest dessert I\u2019ve ever made, and while it\u2019s not terrible, I can\u2019t think of anything to recommend it over a hundred other apple-based foodstuffs, including an apple.\n\nTaste: 2; ease: 2\n\nBread and butter pudding\n\nBesides suet, the other big ingredient you\u2019ll find in endangered British puddings is old bread \u2013 the older the better. Many pudding recipes even offer tips for ageing bread which is insufficiently past it.\n\nI\u2019ve tasted \u2013 and, with certain reservations, enjoyed \u2013 bread and butter pudding in the past, but I\u2019ve never made my own. I hadn\u2019t quite realised the extent to which it is simply breakfast in another form \u2013 toast, butter, eggs, milk \u2013 with a few sultanas scattered over the top. As classic puddings go, it\u2019s refreshingly foolproof \u2013 just layer everything into a deep dish, like a lasagne, and bake until set. My family ate this without complaint and, although I\u2019ve always found it disconcerting that actual slices of bread are left sticking up out of it \u2013 like the sardine heads poking out of a stargazy pie \u2013 I would hate to see it become extinct for that reason.\n\nTaste: 3; ease: 3\n\nQueen of puddings\n\nTo be on the safe side, I chose a recipe by the queen of puddings herself, Delia Smith. This is another old bread dessert, requiring fresh (ie stale) white breadcrumbs soaked in hot milk, combined with sugar, egg yolks, butter and lemon zest. The result is baked in an ovenproof dish until it takes on a weird rubbery texture. Then you spread melted jam over the top, layer stiff egg whites on top of the jam, and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes until the meringue peaks are nicely singed.\n\nThis was a wholly surprising success \u2013 elegant and even a little decadent, although I only had a taste before my wife took the whole thing to a dinner party I wasn\u2019t invited to, and came back with an empty dish. In the circumstances, full marks.\n\nTaste: 5; ease: 4\n\nTreacle sponge pudding\n\nI\u2019m relieved to discover that this contains neither suet or old bread. According to Delia, it\u2019s a sponge batter with a bit of black treacle in the mix, poured into a pudding basin that already has a generous puddle of golden syrup in the bottom, and steamed for two hours. When it\u2019s turned out, the syrup should run down through it in the time-honoured fashion.\n\nMy first ever attempt was a little shabby in appearance \u2013 some of the sponge clung to the bowl, and I missed the middle of the plate when turning it out \u2013 but it was absolutely delicious when accompanied by custard, double cream, clotted cream or, in my case, an unholy combination of the three.\n\nTaste: 5; ease: 4\n\nFlummery\n\nAn ancient, jelly-like dessert, flummery is traditionally thickened with the starch that comes from oatmeal soaked in water. This presents two problems from the modern cook\u2019s perspective: first, a full 48 hours of soaking is required before the oatmeal is discarded and the starchy water preserved; and second, even that will not be enough.\n\n\u201cSo the flummery refuses to thicken,\u201d is a phrase that could easily come from a 17th-century book of aphorisms. But that\u2019s what happened to me. I stirred the mixture of cloudy oat water, orange juice and sugar for nearly half an hour, and still it doth refuse.\n\nThe recipe I consulted says that if your flummery is reluctant to thicken you can add a bit of cornflour, which is another way of saying \u201cwarning: this recipe may not work\u201d. A bit of cornflour, I decided, equates to about half a teaspoon. When that achieved nothing, I added another half teaspoon, and another, and another. By that point I was thinking: even if this works, it\u2019s no longer a true flummery.\n\nSuddenly, almost an hour after I started stirring, the mixture turned to glue. I beat in some cream and put it in the fridge, as instructed, to set even further. The recipe is meant to yield six dessert glasses of flummery. My version stretched to exactly one.\n\nHowever, once I\u2019d added a thin layer of honey mixed with whisky, and a thick layer of piped whipped cream dusted with orange zest, the dessert started looking the part. It even tasted good, although of the three layers, the bottom one \u2013 the flummery itself \u2013 was my least favourite.\n\nTaste: 3; ease: 1\n\nSpotted dick\n\nThis is the last of the suet puddings on the list, and ideally the last one I will ever make. I am getting very good at trussing up puddings for steaming, but progressively less good at eating them \u2013 I\u2019m beginning to lose heart.\n\nThis is essentially the same old basic suet dough, this time studded with currants, a sort of miser\u2019s raisin. Curiously, James Martin\u2019s recipe leaves out the protective foil layer for steaming \u2013 he uses greaseproof paper with a tea towel over the top instead. It sounds risky, but I follow his instructions because I\u2019m not in a position to know if it makes a difference.\n\nThe result, however, looks perfect, and tastes exactly as I guessed it would: dry and dull. It\u2019s much better with custard, but not as good as custard on its own.\n\nTaste: 2; ease: 4\n\nMalvern pudding\n\nThis one is simple \u2013 apples in custard, with a demerara sugar and cinnamon crust on top, like a Worcestershire creme brulee. The Hairy Bikers\u2019 recipe relies on what is essentially a creme patissiere; but if you can nail that part the rest is easy, as well as tasty. It\u2019s also the only one of the 10 puddings here that you could conceivably produce on a whim. Malvern pudding came eighth in a list of the 10 most threatened British puddings back in 2006 (calf\u2019s foot jelly came top), but on this showing it deserves reassessment.\n\nTaste: 5; ease: 4\n\nCabinet pudding\n\nThe historical version of cabinet pudding \u2013 or chancellor\u2019s pudding \u2013 seems to be another old bread recipe, but the version I made is a fairly ordinary kind of sponge. The gimmicks are the mixed peel added to the dough and the halved glace cherries decorating the sides. You must add the dough a bit at a time, to support each fresh row of cherries along the wall of the basin, otherwise they\u2019ll slip off. It needs to steam for an hour and a half, which in the world of traditional British puddings is a blink of an eye.\n\nI like this one \u2013 it looks very impressive, for comparatively little effort, and, like almost all these puddings, it begs to be drowned in custard or cream or both. If you were the chancellor you may feel you deserved more, but I was happy enough.\n\nTaste: 3; ease: 4\n\nRice pudding\n\nA confession: I have a longstanding aversion to rice pudding. I can\u2019t call it dislike, because I\u2019ve never actually let any pass my lips. But it doesn\u2019t rise to the level of a phobia either; just a lifetime of saying, \u201cNone for me, thanks.\u201d\n\nI trust the food writer Simon Hopkinson in all things, but I\u2019m taking his word for it in this case, since I don\u2019t know what rice pudding is supposed to taste like. He starts his rice pudding on the hob: melting butter, coating the pudding rice (not that easy to come by, but it\u2019s basically paella rice), and stirring in sugar until the rice is swollen and sticky. Add milk \u2013 a whole litre \u2013 some cream, vanilla and a grating of nutmeg over the top. Bake for between an hour and 90 minutes, depending.\n\nI\u2019m assured by my wife, who likes rice pudding, that this is a very good version. Having tried it for the first time, I can return to my aversion with confidence. At this point, I quite fancy a Calippo.\n\nTaste: 3.5; ease: 5\n\nOf all the puddings tested, I would say that Malvern pudding is most worthy of rehabilitation, and simultaneously the most in need of it. And while I would shed no tears if either spotted dick or Sussex pond pudding became extinct tomorrow, jam roly-poly is one pudding I\u2019d be happy to terminate with extreme prejudice."

                "text": "No debuts appear on this year\u2019s Booker prize shortlist, which is dominated by established authors including previous winner Kiran Desai and previously shortlisted writers David Szalay and Andrew Miller.\n\nBen Markovits, Susan Choi and Katie Kitamura are also on the list, which was announced at an event at the Southbank Centre in central London on Tuesday evening.\n\nThis year\u2019s judging panel includes the actor Sarah Jessica Parker, who runs publishing imprint SJP Lit, and is chaired by Irish author Roddy Doyle, who won the Booker in 1993.\n\nDesai \u2013 who was awarded the prize in 2006 for The Inheritance of Loss \u2013 is shortlisted for the first book she has written since that win, The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny, a story of love and family set between India and the US. At nearly 700 pages, the Indian author\u2019s third novel is the longest on the shortlist.\n\nHungarian-British writer Szalay, who was previously shortlisted in 2016, made this year\u2019s list for Flesh, which follows protagonist Istv\u00e1n from his teens to midlife, and from Hungary to London. Szalay \u201chas written a novel about the Big Question: about the numbing strangeness of being alive; about what, if anything, it means to amble through time in a machine made of meat\u201d, wrote Keiran Goddard in a Guardian review.\n\nBritish writer Miller, who was also shortlisted in 2001, is chosen this year for his tenth novel, The Land in Winter, about two young couples living in the West Country during the Big Freeze of 1962-63.\n\n\u201cAll of the books, in six different and very fresh ways, find their stories in the examination of the individual trying to live with \u2013 to love, to seek attention from, to cope with, to understand, to keep at bay, to tolerate, to escape from \u2013 other people,\u201d said Doyle. \u201cIn other words, they are all brilliantly written and they are all brilliantly human.\u201d\n\nHalf the shortlist comprises American authors (Markovits, Choi and Kitamura). Asked about the dominance of American writers on the list, judge and writer Chris Power said that \u201cthere are books I would be very sorry not to have encountered when you\u2019re judging a prize for the best novel written in English this year\u201d, were the award not open to Americans. \u201cI think we have to acknowledge that [English is] a global language, and this is a global prize.\u201d\n\nWhen the prize was first awarded in 1969, it was open to Commonwealth writers, but from 2014 onward, writers of any nationality could be entered.\n\nFour of the six titles are published by Penguin: Flesh, The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny, Audition and Choi\u2019s Flashlight. Doyle said this was not an \u201cindication in any way that independents aren\u2019t publishing good fiction\u201d.\n\nKitamura was shortlisted for Audition, described as a \u201cliterary performance of true uncanniness\u201d in a Guardian review by Sam Byers. This is a \u201cnovel of mirrored halves\u201d: in the first, a young man tells the narrator she is his mother, which she \u201cmakes clear is impossible\u201d; in the second half, he is her son, or, at least, is \u201cwillingly performing that role\u201d. At under 200 pages, Audition is the slimmest book on this year\u2019s shortlist.\n\nChoi\u2019s Flashlight, which began life as a short story, is about the disappearance of a Korean \u00e9migr\u00e9, and moves between postwar Japan, suburban America and North Korea.\n\nCompleting the shortlist is Markovits\u2019s The Rest of Our Lives. Narrator Tom Layward, a 55-year-old law professor, drops his daughter off at university but doesn\u2019t head back home to his wife in New York, instead driving west.\n\nJoining Doyle, Parker and Power on this year\u2019s judging panel are the novelists Ay\u1ecd\u0300b\u00e1mi Ad\u00e9b\u00e1y\u1ecd\u0300 and Kiley Reid.\n\nThe judges selected their longlist and shortlist from 153 books submitted to the prize this year. The meeting to decide the shortlist lasted \u201cabout four hours\u201d, said Doyle.\n\nSeven titles from the \u201cBooker dozen\u201d longlist did not make the shortlist: Love Forms by Claire Adam, The South by Tash Aw, Universality by Natasha Brown, One Boat by Jonathan Buckley, Endling by Maria Reva, Seascraper by Benjamin Wood and Misinterpretation by Ledia Xhoga.\n\nParker described the shortlisting process as \u201creal agony\u201d, adding that there is \u201cnothing casual about letting a book go\u201d.\n\nThe winner of the Booker prize will be announced on 10 November, and receive \u00a350,000. Last year\u2019s winner was Orbital by Samantha Harvey. Other recent winners include Paul Lynch, Shehan Karunatilaka, Damon Galgut and Douglas Stuar."

                "text": "When some enterprising director gets around to making Pete Doherty: The Movie, Frank Dillane won\u2019t need to audition. With his black leather jacket, bed-head and baby face, this could be the youthful Libertines frontman seated before me next to a potted plant in an east London cafe. Unlike the young Doherty, however, the actor\u2019s drug of choice is a flat white. And he isn\u2019t hell-bent on sabotaging his career. Not any more.\n\nAfter playing the haunted, drug-addicted Nick Clark in four seasons of the zombie TV spin-off Fear the Walking Dead, Dillane, now 34, fled to Berlin for two years and turned his back on fame. A glance at some of the video interviews he did to promote the show is enough to explain why: he looks at best fidgety, at worst bored and resentful.\n\n\u201cNick was a junkie, and my work on the show was all about understanding him,\u201d he says, toying with the three gold rings on his right hand. \u201cThen I\u2019d be asked all these questions that trivialised what I\u2019d done.\u201d Behind the scenes, there were stern words about his behaviour. \u201cI was told to talk differently, dress differently, attend media training.\u201d Did he? \u201cNo. I was a young, bloody-minded artist!\u201d Eyes crinkling, he gives a wheezy laugh. His Artful Dodger charm could disarm a warmonger.\n\nThat hiatus in Berlin temporarily arrested his ascent. \u201cStraight after Fear the Walking Dead was the moment to capitalise on everything and do this film or that film,\u201d he reflects. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want it.\u201d\n\nHe does now. Fortunately, the perfect vehicle to relaunch himself, and to show off his range and sensitivity, has arrived in the shape of Urchin, the directorial debut of Harris Dickinson, star of Babygirl. Dillane plays Mike, an unhoused Londoner ricocheting from pavement to prison to hostel. An odyssey that could have been punishingly bleak is redeemed partly by the actor\u2019s sheer ebullience. Whether chancing upon a pair of snakeskin loafers in a charity shop, presenting his probation officer with a miniature cactus or belting out a karaoke rendition of Atomic Kitten\u2019s Whole Again, Mike stays upbeat when the chips are down, which is most of the time.\n\nEven when he is bad, the good still peeks through: knocking a stranger to the ground, he mutters his apologies as he raids his victim\u2019s pockets. \u201cThere\u2019s a childishness that I wanted to achieve with him,\u201d says Dillane, crossing one leg over the other and exposing pale pink socks worn with battered penny loafers. \u201cEarly on, I grew facial hair for the film, but then I shaved it all off. It spoilt the innocent effect when I looked like a cartel boss.\u201d\n\nGenial he may be but Dillane is in no hurry to discuss his preparation for Urchin. He confirms that the begging scenes are authentic, shot on busy streets using a long lens: \u201cPeople ignore you when you approach them. It makes you feel like you\u2019re not human.\u201d What he won\u2019t reveal is whether he slept rough, as has previously been reported, or what sort of history he mapped out for Mike. \u201cI want to keep that stuff to myself. You guys have the film.\u201d\n\nWhen I inquire after the character\u2019s body language, he lets out a mock-huff \u2013 \u201cFine!\u201d \u2013 and admits that he did a drawing of Mike before shooting began. \u201cI wrote a trauma in each joint. His right foot is held like that because of an injury. His leg is like that because of the time some girl rejected him. He holds his back that way from the stress of when he got shouted at. He\u2019s carrying everything around with him.\u201d\n\nAt first, Dillane wondered if race might be an impediment to playing Mike. \u201cI saw him as a white kid from an estate in England,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my mum\u2019s Jamaican so I don\u2019t classify myself as white. I\u2019ll often get cast as posh white people. The posh thing I\u2019ll take. I\u2019m not going to pretend I\u2019ve had an upbringing like Mike.\u201d\n\nFar from it. After spending his early years in south London, he moved with his parents \u2013 actors Naomi Wirthner (Slow Horses) and Stephen Dillane (Sherwood, Game of Thrones) \u2013 to Forest Row, East Sussex, which was named Britain\u2019s third poshest village in a 2023 Times poll. \u201cThird poshest?\u201d he gasps. \u201cThird weirdest, maybe. There\u2019s a lot of Scientology there.\u201d\n\nBack to race. \u201cI was the darkest person in the school when I got to Sussex. And I\u2019ve had the experience of being paled up for roles, blue contact lenses, that kind of stuff. Like when I played Voldemort.\u201d\n\nAt 18, Dillane starred as the villain\u2019s younger incarnation, Tom Riddle, the Teen Who Must Not Be Named, in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. He has since notched up numerous period roles, from a highwayman in Sally Wainwright\u2019s Renegade Nell to a doctor in The Essex Serpent. He will next be seen alongside Daisy Edgar-Jones in a new film of Sense and Sensibility, in which he plays Mr Willoughby. \u201cHe\u2019s a car crash,\u201d he says fondly. In an age before cars? \u201cYeah. A carriage crash!\u201d\n\nIt seems to have only just dawned on Dillane that he has spent much of his career in period dress. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of that stuff, haven\u2019t I? Maybe I\u2019m being shortsighted thinking that mixed-race people can\u2019t do posh period roles.\u201d He drums his hands on the table. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m unravelling as I\u2019m getting into this with you. I should be talking to my therapist about it.\u201d\n\nThe trick with capturing Mike, he discovered, was to see beyond race. \u201cI had this idea of the human animal. Like, if you take a human being and remove their security, family, friends, home, then what are you left with? It\u2019s all about humanity.\u201d That shines through. No wonder he took home a best actor prize from the Un Certain Regard sidebar at Cannes this year.\n\nAny tension between the dire circumstances in which Mike finds himself, and his determination, verging on zeal, to make the best of things, is vital to the movie. It almost broke Dillane\u2019s heart. \u201cMike\u2019s thinking, \u2018Everything\u2019s going to be fine\u2019. And then it isn\u2019t. That was difficult to achieve. Harris had to keep reminding me: \u2018This is an optimistic moment.\u2019 For me, it\u2019s all so sad, you know?\u201d He gets a faraway look, his eyes gleaming with tears. \u201cMy experience of researching and working on the film was one of intense suffering. Not just personal suffering but the impotence of not being able to help people: their fragility, their addiction.\u201d\n\nHe talks passionately about inequality and the consolidation of wealth, and his time spent working for a homelessness charity long before he was cast in Urchin. I wonder how that sits with his education at the fee-paying Michael Hall school, which proudly posted about his Cannes win on its Facebook page. (The post earned 42 likes.)\n\n\u201cYeah, but I went to a Steiner school before that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was three caravans in a field. Also, when I went to Rada, the fee wasn\u2019t what it is today. It\u2019s really expensive now.\u201d He mulls this over. \u201cI guess it is kind of embarrassing. We all have our privilege. I do hold guilt for it, I suppose.\u201d Then there is his status as a nepo baby. \u201cNep-oh-tism. It\u2019s quite a nice word, isn\u2019t it? Look, I dunno. Acting is just what my family always did. What does your dad do?\u201d Finding that the answer isn\u2019t journalism, he relents. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s different for writers.\u201d\n\nStill, no one who sees Urchin could accuse Dillane of coasting on the family name. Playing Mike has fundamentally changed him, he insists. \u201cMy humanity is broader. I\u2019m sorry to bring Jesus into this, but Jesus went among the lepers. He gave time, energy and love. Giving yourself to a situation, to a person, without the endgame of fixing them can be helpful. People want quick, simple solutions to complex problems like homelessness. But there aren\u2019t any. Your willpower alone will not fix the world.\u201d\n\nUrchin has also rejuvenated his career prospects. \u201cI wasn\u2019t engaging with any of it before in the way that, say, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet does. He\u2019s fucking on it, right? And he loves it. I see myself now as more like that. Talking to my agents, turning up looking neat, trying this and chasing that and la-la-la-la-la.\u201d\n\nAs we head off together into the drizzly afternoon, Dillane clutching a black satchel, he admits to being nervous when he strolled into the cafe an hour earlier. \u201cI wanted to paint a good picture of myself and not dwell too much on my mistakes,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of my existence now involves the older me coming to terms with choices that the younger me made: \u2018You turned down what?\u2019 And: \u2018I can\u2019t go back and change that\u2019 It\u2019s like: \u2018No. So now what do you do?\u2019\u201d The answer seems obvious. You do more good films. More films like Urchin."

                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "Onyx \u2013 Throw Ya Gunz (1992)\n\nThe first music video Diane Martel directed was for the debut single by hardcore hip-hop group Onyx. Filmed predominantly in South Jamaica, Queens, and allegedly featuring real guns, it\u2019s a grimy and energetic video, yo-yoing between the group performing on a beach and aggressive closeups shot in dimly lit basements. Martel, a young white woman who had directed two documentaries, might have seemed like an unlikely choice, but according to Onyx member Fredro Starr, she properly mucked in. \u201cShe would be getting on the floor, like getting dirty with it,\u201d he said in one interview. \u201cShe made that video. If you wasn\u2019t a director who was willing to get dirty, that video wouldn\u2019t have came out like that. I gotta give her the props.\u201d\n\nMariah Carey \u2013 All I Want for Christmas Is You (1994)\n\nMartel directed a number of videos for Mariah Carey, including Dreamlover, The Roof, and the remix video for Heartbreaker. The clip for this festive behemoth, however, was actually filmed before Carey had even written the song. Co-directed by Carey herself and shot at farm in upstate New York, it was made to look like Super 8 in post-production, with Carey getting so cold during filming that her hair froze. While Carey has said that she didn\u2019t \u201clove every shot in this video\u201d, it does exemplify what Martel called her \u201cminimalist work\u201d, putting artists \u201cfront and centre\u201d in her videos: \u201cThey have to perform because there is not a lot else going on.\u201d\n\nMethod Man \u2013 I\u2019ll Be There for You / You\u2019re All I Need to Get By ft Mary J Blige (1995)\n\nWhile her videos often prioritised simplicity, Martel\u2019s approach for this Grammy-winning partnership between Method Man and Mary J Blige was more cinematic, incorporating a loose narrative about a man being pursued by police. The romance embedded in Method Man\u2019s lyrics is captured in the more grounded shots of the rapper and Blige silhouetted against a backdrop of an industrial cityscape, their appearance a reminder that love helps you overcome life\u2019s challenges.\n\nChristina Aguilera \u2013 Genie in a Bottle (1999)\n\nMartel directed two music videos for Christina Aguilera, including the one for her indelible debut single. Here you can see the director\u2019s emphasis on performance in action, a then 18-year-old Aguilera serving up tight choreography and a bare mid-riff as she shimmies into pop stardom. Nipping at the heels of Britney Spears\u2019s \u2026 Baby One More Time, both song and video were a lightning rod for controversy. But Aguilera\u2019s offering wore its sexuality more boldly and with more maturity than Spears. This was likely by design: \u201cEven if there\u2019s a sexual fantasy involved,\u201d Martel said in 2003, \u201cit doesn\u2019t have to be a lazy, exploitive mess.\u201d It\u2019s a philosophy she perhaps didn\u2019t always stick to, but one in practice here.\n\nEve \u2013 Who\u2019s That Girl? (2001)\n\nBy the early 2000s, you can see Martel becoming more adventurous. While her work still primarily spotlighted what she described in 2013 as \u201cthe artist doing it\u201d, the video for Eve\u2019s Who\u2019s That Girl? demonstrates how she was experimenting with different technologies, aesthetics and set design. From the appearance of a tiger, the various CGI backdrops and a strange, animated vignette to the highly saturated colour palette and overblown lighting, this video feels like it wrote the style guide that Hype Williams would later follow throughout the 2000s.\n\nNERD \u2013 Lapdance (2001)\n\nIf Eve\u2019s Who\u2019s That Girl? was Martel expanding herself, this NERD video feels reminiscent of her earlier work with artists such as Onyx and Redman. \u201cI try to stay true to the genre of music in terms of the lensing, framing and lighting,\u201d she said in 2006, something that feels particularly true of the video for the solo cup-waving frat rap of Lapdance. The chiaroscuro lighting suggests depravity, Pharrell and the gang cavorting with scantily clad women at a testosterone-fuelled house party. Martel and NERD even made an explicit version of the video, featuring nudity and eye-rolling girl-on-girl action, something of a precursor to the infamous video for Blurred Lines.\n\nJustin Timberlake \u2013 Like I Love You (2002)\n\nMartel clearly understood the role a good music video could play in introducing an artist to the world. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a sales tool,\u201d she said in 2003, \u201cbut it\u2019s also a visual presentation of the artist\u2019s poetry and culture, interpreted by the director.\u201d This mentality is on full display in the Like I Love You video, which helped reposition Justin Timberlake as a solo star. The simplicity of the video (\u201cnone of my videos are conceptual, even the conceptual ones,\u201d she once said) provides ample room for Timberlake to prove he\u2019s no longer a curly-haired teenybopper as he dances with a virility that accentuates his maturity. And the many close ups of his face? Proof that Martel understood the video\u2019s target demographic.\n\nStacie Orrico \u2013 Stuck (2003)\n\nNarrative wasn\u2019t usually a priority for Martel, but she leaned into it while making the video for Stuck, the underrated single by Stacie Orrico. The story plays out like something from a teen drama, Orrico lamenting her ongoing attachment to an ex-boyfriend who cheated on her. Martel captures the teenage frustration and longing of the song by repeatedly isolating Orrico, be it through the window of a school bus, the fence of a basketball court or by placing her alone in her bedroom. Doing so lends the story credibility, resulting in a video that has timeless appeal.\n\nRobin Thicke \u2013 Blurred Lines ft TI, Pharrell (2013)\n\nIt\u2019s the song and video that launched 1,000 think pieces, many of which rightly highlighted the predatory lyrics and the issue of how women were often objectified in music videos. For her part, Martel said that she was simply trying to make something that would \u201csell records\u201d in the internet age. In that respect she delivered: the song became one of the best-selling singles of all time. The video is also typical of Martel\u2019s minimalist style. Inspired by the work of George Balanchine, Richard Avedon and, incredibly, Benny Hill, the video is set against a white wall, Martel employing meme-able props, nudity, exaggerated movements and oversized graphics to draw the eye.\n\nWas it sexist? Martel didn\u2019t think so, suggesting that it actually skewered the queasy message of the song. \u201cI wanted to deal with the misogynist, funny lyrics in a way where the girls were going to overpower the men,\u201d she said at the time. Later, in 2021, when writer and model Emily Ratajkowski, who starred in the video, alleged that Robin Thicke had sexually assaulted her on the set, Martel confirmed the story, saying she shut down the shoot until Thicke apologised. \u201cWe kept on and Emily was phenomenal,\u201d she added. \u201cShe\u2019s really the star of the video. She\u2019s fully mocking him and the male gaze with her beautiful shape and ferocious energy. She\u2019s playful, not seductive. And quite hilarious.\u201d\n\nMiley Cyrus \u2013 We Can\u2019t Stop (2013)"

                "text": "My husband and I are in an open relationship (both male, married for eight years) and on a recent holiday we started to explore group sex. We had a wonderful threesome where we both felt great afterwards and had a mutual attraction to the other man \u2013 which is rare for us. However, our latest endeavour wasn\u2019t as successful.\n\nWe invited a couple and a single man back to our hotel room. Everything was great during the fivesome, and afterwards the couple left. We invited the other man to stay the night (mostly led by me). In the morning, things between me and this man started to heat up. He went to the bathroom and I asked my husband if he wanted to partake, to which he said no and that he\u2019d rather sleep. Regardless, I carried on with the man for a short period until we climaxed.\n\nAfter he left, my husband was extremely mad at me. It wasn\u2019t a boundary we had discussed, and I\u2019ve apologised. However, part of me feels like it isn\u2019t as bad as he\u2019s making me feel. He has punished me with silence, distance and an expectation of pandering from me throughout. I also feel like he\u2019s using it as an excuse for his own bad behaviour of concealing communication with other men. Our agreement is to be upfront and honest about everything we get up to, but he has a history of hiding and erasing sext messages, and in general is quite closed off with his feelings. Am I morally in the wrong here? And is there hope for us in the relationship?\n\nI cannot be a morality judge, but what I can say is that any open relationship requires a great deal of frankness, negotiation and respect for each other\u2019s feelings. Clearly, as often happens with couples, there is a discrepancy between your understanding of what was acceptable during group sex and your husband\u2019s. The finer points really need to be discussed in great detail as soon as possible.\n\nBut even if a couple discuss all kinds of scenarios they think might occur, it is still easy to be taken by surprise by new situations and feelings that arise unexpectedly and create turmoil. You seem to have good insight, and have now learned that for your husband, each new situation requires that you check in with him.\n\nPeople who are alexithymic (who find it hard to express emotion) have great difficulty letting others know when they are uncomfortable about something, and may require prompting. In the heat of the moment it can be easy to forget this, but he has made it clear that it\u2019s important to him. If you wish to continue including other people for sexual fun with relative emotional safety, stay in touch with your intuition and err on the side of caution.\n\nPamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders."

Love may be blind, but clutter? It sees everything.\n\nComing home doesn\u2019t mean kicking back in peace \u2014 it means surviving a fashion and laundry minefield.\n\nNearly 4 in 10 say their partner immediately trades work clothes for \u201ccomfy\u201d outfits, while 30% are living in a sea of dirty laundry.\n\nOver a quarter admit piles overflow like a laundry volcano, and 19% report socks and underwear scattered like confetti.\n\nAdd another 19% whose partners traipse around in \u201coutside clothes\u201d on the bed or couch, and 15% who can\u2019t tell clean from dirty \u2014 welcome to domestic chaos, courtesy of your significant other.\n\nBut mess doesn\u2019t just make you step around socks \u2014 it sparks secret wars. Nearly 4 in 10 adults admit they\u2019ve purged a partner\u2019s belongings in secret, with Gen Z cranking that number up to 46%.\n\nSome men have even \u201caccidentally\u201d broken things just to get rid of them \u2014 a sneaky 35%, with Gen Z doubling down at 52%.\n\nAnd for engaged couples? Domestic sabotage is practically a rite of passage: 46% have tossed stuff in secret, and 42% have broken it intentionally.\n\nSome people go even further, turning love into leverage. One in five Gen Zers say they\u2019ve withheld affection, time, or attention to get their partner to clean.\n\nMarried couples? Not so much \u2014 63% say they\u2019ve never pulled that stunt.\n\nAnd mess doesn\u2019t just wreck relationships \u2014 it kills potential romance before it even starts.\n\nNearly one in four Americans have decided not to pursue someone after seeing their place, with 38% of Gen Zers saying a chaotic home gives them the ultimate ick.\n\nAt the end of the day, the biggest gripe remains the simplest: 28% of people just wish their partner would clean without being asked.\n\nSharing the load may seem basic, but apparently, it\u2019s revolutionary.\n\nClutter may be silent, but its effects are loud. From dirty laundry to secret purges, messy living is turning love into a battlefield \u2014 and no one wants to fight over socks.\n\nAs previously reported by The Post, more than half of Americans say a partner scrubbing the sink or tackling laundry sparks attraction.\n\nExperts via housecleaning company Homeaglow say doing the dishes tops the list as a major turn-on.\n\nAnd if you need a trick to get your partner to actually pitch in? Behavioral scientist Zelana Montminy says just tell them to \u201ctake the mental lead on this one.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just about chores, as she dished to PureWow \u2014 it\u2019s about handing them the wheel and letting them steer.\n\nUltimately, when it comes to romance, clutter clearly isn\u2019t cute \u2014 so experts say it\u2019s best to grab a sponge and save your relationship."

                "source": "theguardian",
                "text": "Ethan Hawke is hilariously raccoon-like in The Lowdown; not just because his hair is all scraggly grey-and-black, and usually in various states of disarray depending on whether his Lee Raybon is crawling out from the wrong side of the bed or the trunk of some neo-Nazi\u2019s car.\n\nA freelance journalist by trade (among other things), Lee is the self-appointed gumshoe in creator Sterlin Harjo\u2019s deliciously pulpy and deceptively lighthearted noir caper. He sniffs around Tulsa, Oklahoma, digs through people\u2019s trash, repeatedly makes a mess of things and mostly gets hostile responses from the people who have the misfortune of crossing paths with him (pretty much the world a raccoon lives in). But, every so often, someone will find Lee adorable or sympathetic enough that they just might lend him a helping hand, or even take him to bed with them.\n\nHawke is teaming with Harjo again in the eight-part series (of which critics received five episodes), after appearing in the latter\u2019s Peabody-winning Reservation Dogs. He\u2019s predictably terrific in the role, playing Lee as a rascal who we simultaneously root for and are embarrassed by. He\u2019s a self-righteous narcissist who calls himself Tulsa\u2019s \u201ctruthstorian\u201d. He\u2019s always the first to toot his own horn whenever he accomplishes something (anything), even if there\u2019s no one around for him to share the satisfaction with. His mission to clean house around Tulsa \u2013 taking on white supremacists, crooked real estate developers and local politicians, who may all be in bed with each other \u2013 is perhaps Lee\u2019s way to distract from how much of a disaster he\u2019s created in his own home.\n\nLee is short on both child support payments \u2013 owed to his ever-patient ex Samantha (Kaniehtiio Horn) \u2013 and payroll at the local bookstore he owns. He tries to make ends meet with gigs at local magazines, whether they print news or nudes. He\u2019ll take the paycheck from whoever is willing to publish his unflattering articles about the rich and/or racist in Tulsa. For Lee, these stories are meant to kick up a storm so that he could wade through the aftermath for more answers.\n\nThere\u2019s beauty to the chaos that fuels and follows Lee, a guy who arranges the inventory at his bookstore so that Harold Pinter sits next to Harry Potter. Crass as that pairing may seem, it\u2019s of a piece with The Lowdown, which makes a melody out of the discordant tones and myriad influences that it has on tap.\n\nThis series is drunk on the Coen brothers, David Lynch and Raymond Chandler. Harjo and his writing team also tip their hat to Jim Thompson, the crime fiction writer, and Oklahoma native, whose hardboiled stories \u2013 about sordid affairs, double-crosses and murders involving Texas oil and construction magnates \u2013 are a literal plot device in The Lowdown. Lee finds clues to this mystery, surrounding the possible murder of a member of Oklahoma\u2019s elite (Tim Blake Nelson, as twangy as ever), buried in those paperbacks\u2019 pages.\n\nThe Lowdown isn\u2019t just in conversation with those influences, but also, in compelling ways, Harjo\u2019s Reservation Dogs. The earlier series was an achingly beautiful slacker comedy about teens from Muscogee (Creek) Nation who bounce around their tight-knit community as it heals from loss and intergenerational trauma. Reservation Dogs broke new ground for (long overdue) Indigenous representation, being led and mostly populated by people from the community, without ever feeling burdened by its own significance. Over three seasons, the series stayed inventive and light on its feet, absorbed local culture and character, tinkered with genres and eclipsed virtually everything else on television.\n\nThe Lowdown, which retains the same playfulness, is a whole new kind of flex for Harjo, a curious victory lap in this new terrain he\u2019s forged. The Oklahoma native made the new series (with a lot of returning cast and crew) about a white man, flipping the more common and usually exploitative equation, where settler film-makers tell Indigenous stories. Watching the way white people move through an Indigenous lens turns out to be a far more rewarding experience; not just when it comes to all the crooked politicians and backroom schemers in The Lowdown.\n\nThere\u2019s also Hawke\u2019s Lee, who behaves a bit like a white saviour, with that narcissistic air about him. When Lee grills fellow Oklahomans about their ignorance or predatory ways, you can\u2019t help but clock the grandstanding, and how much that performed allyship does for his own ego and sense of purpose.\n\nThat\u2019s as good as it gets when it comes to allies, the show seems to say, not in a deflated or cynical way, but with a generous warmth and sense of hope that\u2019s clear-eyed and practical about how noble work gets done."

I love it because I think it\u2019s funny,\u201d the Oscar-nominated actor added.\n\nHe cited other \u201cfilm noir\u201d characters, such as Jack Nicholson in \u201cChinatown,\u201d who has a \u201cbandaged nose\u201d the whole movie. \u201cThere\u2019s a long history of, \u2018if you go seeking the truth, you\u2019re going to get punched in the face.'\u201d\n\nReferring to his character in \u201cThe Lowdown,\u201d Lee Raybon, Hawke said, \u201cthat\u2019s just Lee\u2019s job. And so, I found it incredibly funny. I love somebody who\u2019s willing to face danger without playing a tough guy. He\u2019s not a tough guy. He\u2019s just willing to do whatever it takes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lowdown\u201d was created by Sterlin Harjo (\u201cReservation Dogs\u201d), and Hawke executive produces and also stars in it.\n\nThe show premieres Tuesday, Sept. 23 on FX (9 p.m.) and airs the next day on Hulu.\n\nIt follows Lee (Hawke), an eccentric Tulsa man who works in a bookstore when he\u2019s not sleuthing to expose local corruption, or being a father to his 14-year-old daughter, Francis (Ryan Kiera Armstrong).\n\nLee gets in hot water when he writes an expose on the powerful Washberg family, including Dale (Tim Blake Nelson), Betty Jo (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and politician Donald (Kyle MacLachlan).\n\nHarjo told The Post that he was friendly with Hawke, and originally sent him the script just asking for his opinion.\n\n\u201cI was too afraid to just say, \u2018Do you want to play this part?\u2019 Because I feel like I was new to this industry. I don\u2019t know how that works,\u201d he explained to The Post. \u201cBut luckily, he wrote me back and just said, \u2018Why am I not playing this character?\u2019 Well, let\u2019s fix that.\u201d\n\nHawke told The Post that his character, Lee, reminded him of his stepfather.\n\n\u201cI had an amazing stepfather who just didn\u2019t really enjoy the way society works, and was really allergic to the laws of popular culture. And he would be frustrated with how everybody was oriented around making money, as if that was going to get us into heaven, and why we weren\u2019t taking care of our brothers and sisters,\u201d the \u201cFirst Reformed\u201d actor explained.\n\nThe \u201cBoyhood\u201d star added that his stepfather was \u201can inspiring person to be around,\u201d but that his ethics \u201cgot him into a lot of personal drama.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would say the thing you\u2019re not supposed to say, and it was true \u2026 Maybe it wasn\u2019t the right time, but when is the right time?\u201d he asked. \u201cUsually never!\u201d\n\nLee also reminded him of people he encountered in the arts.\n\n\u201cA lot of idealism and that idealism gets knocked down as soon as people start having children. A lot of dreams die. And, there\u2019s some people that somehow just keep crawling back. I love people like that,\u201d said Hawke, who is a father of four: son Levon and \u201cStranger Things\u201d star Maya, who he had with his ex wife Uma Thurman, and daughters Clementine and Indiana, whom he had with his current wife, Ryan Shawhughes Hawke.\n\nThe \u201cReality Bites\u201d actor added that when many people are in their early 20s, they have \u201cdreams and ideas of what the world is about, what it\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d but as they grow up, \u201ccompromises\u201d get involved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always admired people that don\u2019t give up on that side of themselves, and keep wanting to be the person that they dreamed they could have been when they were 16,\u201d said Hawke.\n\n\u201cBut, that doesn\u2019t integrate very well with the box that society wants us to be in, and meeting all your responsibilities.\u201d\n\nHe quipped that Lee is \u201ca hot mess \u2026 and that, to me, is real life.\u201d"

                "text": "\u2018Wake naturally. Ride bikes. Wild camp.\u201d I\u2019m in Perthshire on a three-day bikepacking trip \u2013 cycling with all my gear \u2013 and this is my itinerary for the day. For an endlessly calendar-checking parent of three, the simplicity of this schedule is almost dizzying. I feel like a child with my summer holiday stretching out ahead of me.\n\nComrie Croft Journeys is a new initiative from eco-camping and mountain-biking destination Comrie Croft, started by experienced mountain bike instructor Emily Greaves. The off-grid cycling adventures aim to immerse visitors in Scotland\u2019s wild landscapes while providing everything they need, from food to equipment. Guests can choose to be self-guided or led \u2013 and I\u2019m heading out with Emily to explore on a mountain bike for the first time in my adult life.\n\nThe croft is set across quiet woodland and bucolic meadows and I arrive early to explore the onsite organic market garden Tomnah\u2019a and enjoy a hearty mixed grain bowl with roast root vegetables and local Wee Comrie cheese at Gorse cafe. I\u2019ve driven here, but for the ultimate emission-avoiding trip, it\u2019s possible to get the train to Gleneagles from Edinburgh or London, then be picked up in the Croft\u2019s electric car.\n\nBefore we hit the trails, Emily puts me through my paces with a mountain-biking lesson on the gravel pump track. We\u2019re cycling for three days and everything we need \u2013 clothes, food, camping stove, tent, sleeping bags and mat \u2013 has to be strapped to our bikes. Beside me a French family is getting set up for a self-guided adventure. Emily has planned their route, pre-loaded on a GPX device with detailed trip notes, and prepped their bikes and equipment. I thought I\u2019d packed light, but most of my clothes are soon in a discard pile. \u201cYou need clothes to cycle in, warm layers to sleep in, and waterproofs \u2013 that\u2019s it,\u201d Emily says.\n\nFully laden we head off, uphill through ancient woodland and the pretty village of Comrie, then on to rough farm tracks heading into the hills. Tonight\u2019s destination is a youth hostel, a last-minute change due to thundery weather. Bikepacking doesn\u2019t always have to mean camping \u2013 many long-distance cyclists combine camping with stays at hostels and even hotels. It\u2019s about enjoyment, not endurance, or \u201csmiles not miles\u201d, as Emily puts it.\n\nToday\u2019s ride is 20 miles (32km), taking in 520 metres of ascent. It\u2019s an intentionally gentle start, but for me still pretty challenging, as I get to grips with my cycling position, descending on loose gravel, and learning to trust the bike. We pass through fields of sheep, splash through little streams, slowly gaining height over the lower slopes of Carn Labhruinn and Meall Odhar. By the time we descend towards Callander, the clouds darken, obscuring the mountain tops, and heavy rain soaks in the seams of my jacket: I\u2019m delighted not to be putting up a tent. At Callander Hostel, run by a local social enterprise, we stay in a cosy pod in the garden (from \u00a381), dry our soggy clothes, and sleep deeply.\n\nDay two is our longest in the saddle, with 44 miles to cover. Emily, sensibly, doesn\u2019t tell me the ascent until later (it\u2019s 1,020 metres). We set out in high spirits, fuelled by egg and haggis rolls from Mhor Bread in Callander.\n\nWe\u2019re riding through Loch Lomond and the Trossachs national park, an area I\u2019ve often driven through but never stopped to fully appreciate \u2013 I\u2019ve been missing out. With mountains aplenty, peaceful lochs and glens, and a well-connected network of paths and trails, there\u2019s so much to explore. Emily\u2019s well-designed route takes us along some quiet single-track roads, but is mostly off-road, on gravel tracks through heathery glens, forestry plantations and native woodland, and on winding lochside paths through the bracken.\n\nWe pedal along the quiet side of Loch Venachar before joining the Three Lochs Forest Drive, a rough track that links Loch Drunkie, Lochan Re\u00f2idhte, and Loch Achray. It\u2019s hilly, but I\u2019m getting to love the calf-burning push of a long uphill, and the thrill of the downhill too. At Aberfoyle, we stop at Liz MacGregors coffee shop for lemon drizzle cake. \u201cYou have to keep your energy up,\u201d Emily says. She has completed many long-distance cycles, including the epic Highland Trail 550, often named one of Scotland\u2019s toughest off-road cycling races. If she says it\u2019s time to eat cake, I\u2019m only too happy to agree.\n\nAfter a rugged stretch along forestry tracks past pretty Loch Chon, we reach the head of Loch Katrine, where we have the option to catch the Steamship Sir Walter Scott, which takes daytrippers the length of the loch (from \u00a319 one way, \u00a327 return). It\u2019s tempting, but given steamships have been running on Loch Katrine for over 180 years, it seems safe to leave it for another day. Today is all about the bikes, and I don\u2019t want to miss a moment. Later we pitch tents by the shores of Loch Achray, with just a slight dance with the midges until the breeze returns. We collect water, heat up instant meals on our camp stoves, and drink in the views of Ben A\u2019an and Ben Venue.\n\nIn the morning, the loch shimmers silver in the pale sunlight and Emily and I wade in for a beautifully refreshing swim, then warm up with bowls of porridge. The last day of cycling has come round all too soon, and it\u2019s 37 miles back to Comrie, with a lunch stop at Mhor 84 in Balquhidder. The last stretch takes in Glen Finglas estate singletrack, a popular local cycling route along an undulating ridge. I\u2019m loving feeling the power in my legs.\n\nBack at Comrie Croft we\u2019ve reserved seats at Nowhere Sauna (from \u00a316), one of the 12 micro-businesses that operate at the croft. Tucked into a quiet corner of woodland, it\u2019s the perfect place to stretch and relax, interspersed with refreshing dunks in the icy tin bath. From here, it\u2019s a short walk uphill for a decidedly more luxurious evening, at the croft\u2019s newly opened cabin. Joining the site\u2019s camping pitches, Nordic katas (conical, tipi-like tents) and its eco-lodge hostel, the handbuilt wooden cabin is a beautiful hideaway for two adults (plus a child or two on a convertible sofa, if you must). With a wood-burning stove, full kitchen, mezzanine bedroom and big private deck, it\u2019s likely to be popular with onsite weddings and honeymooners. Tonight it\u2019s all mine, and even better, local deli Hansen\u2019s Kitchen has dropped me off supper, including local beers and a lasagne made with vegetables from the market garden. I sit out on the deck until the first stars appear, resting my tired legs and soaking in the scenery, reflecting on an incredible few days."

While some residents benefit from the economic boost associated with football tourism, others express concern over the loss of community cohesion and the rise of antisocial behavior linked to temporary guests. This shift reflects broader changes in the area, driven by the success of Liverpool FC, raising questions about the balance between economic growth and the preservation of local identities.",
                "source": "nytimes",
                "text": "Almost as soon as Anfield\u2019s last visitors leave, new ones swoop in.\n\nOn Tancred Road, four streets away from the district\u2019s famous football stadium and home of Liverpool FC, changeover day in three rental properties last week was Thursday. Out went the Liverpool fans who had travelled from other parts of the world to watch their team\u2019s 3-2 Champions League victory over Atletico Madrid. Shortly after, they were replaced by ones in town for Saturday\u2019s Premier League Merseyside derby against Everton. Nearby, separate groups shared a four-bedroom house from Tuesday to Sunday, taking in both fixtures.\n\nYet this is only a snapshot of how Anfield\u2019s local community has become increasingly fluid in the era of Airbnb. It is difficult to tell how many homes are being rented out like this, because Airbnb is notoriously protective of its data and did not respond to The Athletic\u2019s request for information about its footprint.\n\nBut searching its website for rental options in the area provides a rough guide. Look for somewhere to stay near Anfield in mid-February, for example (when no games are currently scheduled, and therefore availability should be at its height), and you are presented with 31 options in the tangle of streets north-west of the stadium bordered by Anfield Road, Walton Breck Road and Sleepers Hill. Many dozens more are available near the stadium, many of which directly reference the stadium in their Airbnb listings.\n\nThere is no suggestion of any wrongdoing in this. Indeed, for some, this explosion in the short-term rental market is proof of a thriving gig economy. On the face of it, parts of Anfield \u2014 a traditional working-class neighbourhood, which just happened to have a world-famous football ground in it \u2014 have never looked smarter, with the majority of properties closest to the stadium now being what estate agents would term \u201cneatly appointed.\u201d Certainty has encouraged investment and some residents have reacted to the boom in football-related tourism by leasing out rooms, with the additional money helping pay for home improvements as well as mortgages.\n\nYet there are also unintended consequences which are not quite as positive because there are now many properties where no one lives permanently, having been bought up by groups or individuals with little or no connection to the area.\n\nA 10-bedroom \u201ctownhouse\u201d on Anfield Road costs \u00a3938 ($1,126) for a quiet Monday night in February, so you can imagine the sort of sums involved at busier times. Meanwhile, on a street on the opposite side of the ground, eight of the 32 houses are listed on Airbnb, amounting to 25 per cent of the housing stock.\n\nThis has meant that some residents do not know who their neighbours are and each week provides an anxious wait to see who shows up. Areas which were once defined by close-knit relationships, even in hard times, now feel transient and transformed. And not everybody has welcomed it.\n\nNot so long ago, a stench of desperation hung over the warren of narrow streets that surrounds Anfield.\n\nFirst, they suffered as a consequence of the city's wider economic problems, then those issues were exacerbated by the uncertainty which surrounded Liverpool FC's future in the area.\n\nThe club had toyed with the idea of moving to a new site not far away on Stanley Park but ultimately stayed put, although the process was far from smooth. Both the club and city council were accused by residents of driving down conditions in the local area by buying properties \u2014 either directly, through third parties or via compulsory purchase orders \u2014 and allowing them to remain vacant.\n\nThe endgame was for this to allow Liverpool FC to expand Anfield by building a new Main Stand. One road, Lothair Road, was eventually demolished, while another row of houses on nearby Alroy Road also disappeared. Eight years after the new Main Stand was completed in 2016, the Anfield Road Stand was also redeveloped, lifting the stadium's capacity from 45,262 to 61,276.\n\nMore seats means more cash, particularly via new corporate hospitality areas in the rebuilt stands, and Liverpool's record revenues help explain why they have won two league titles and a Champions League since 2019. Even on non-match days, fans fly in from across the globe to 'experience' Anfield, encouraged by partnerships with travel companies such as Expedia.\n\nAll of this has had a profound impact in the area of Anfield. According to the 2021 Census, the ward has a population of 14,730, but four times as many people now visit around 30 times a season for matches, and through the summer after Liverpool FC were given permission to host concerts, swelling the club\u2019s coffers even further.\n\nThere are some thorny logistical issues caused by the redevelopment \u2014 a road that was closed during the Anfield /Road Stand construction work has yet to reopen, although both the club and city council insist they are still working on a solution \u2014 but of potentially more significance is the impact on Anfield's sense of community.\n\nIan Byrne, the Labour member of parliament for West Derby and a Liverpool season ticket holder, has lived in Anfield for the best part of four decades.\n\nA couple of years ago, a property over the road from his home was sold. He still hasn't met the new owner, because they never moved in. Instead, it was listed on Airbnb, along with seven other short-term rentals on the same street.\n\nHe thinks investors began to recognise the area\u2019s potential in 2018 when the application to turn Anfield into a music venue was made, which meant it would be open for most of the year, potentially driving more profits for letters. This coincided with Liverpool\u2019s performances on the field improving, yielding greater interest in the club itself.\n\nByrne says that during the week, the houses listed on Airbnb are usually empty but at weekends they are almost always full, \u201cwhen they become party pads.\u201d What sometimes follows is an increase in noise and anti-social behaviour. On a few occasions, the police have been called in. It means that \u201cevery time a house goes up for sale, you are thinking, \u2018Oh no, not again.\u201d\n\nIn a recent report on Airbnb's economic impact, it pointed out that the company's home-sharing model helps fuel visitor spending in local communities, as well as supporting jobs in multiple industries and creates tax revenue.\n\nYet for Byrne, the most unsettling element of a relatively new phenomenon is the deeper impact on the cohesion of the community and the character of the area.\n\n\u201cSociety feels transient, these are atomised times and a lot of communities feel like they are under attack,\u201d Byrne says. \u201cWhen you are struggling, it\u2019s reassuring to have neighbours that you know because it makes you feel a bit safer and secure. It\u2019s good to be able to pop next door for a chat. The potential loss of this is incalculable. We need stronger communities, not weaker ones. We need more affordable housing rather than see them sold off to faceless people.\u201d\n\nByrne believes the developing situation is symptomatic of what has happened to Anfield since he first arrived, with the district's economy pivoting towards what happens at the stadium. At first, it was the pubs, chip shops and bookmakers defining opening hours mainly around Liverpool matches. \u201cNow that culture is extending to housing,\u201d Byrne says.\n\nThere is a deep sense of helplessness about what can be done to stop the latest iceberg because there are no easy solutions. It would be different if these were hotels, but currently, a lack of regulation means anyone can make their home available with Airbnb. When The Athletic asked Liverpool City Council about the issue, the authority recognised the problem as a \u201cconcern\u201d, suggesting any property being used for this purpose is one less that can be used by a household, which then has an impact on the housing market and rents.\n\nThe proliferation of Airbnb in Anfield, as well as other areas of the city, also reduces the effect of a tourist levy that was voted in by hotels and started in June. This means that any person staying in a hotel room in Liverpool has to pay an additional \u00a32, with the money used by the Liverpool Accommodation Business Improvement District (ABID) for essentially advertising the city, creating a circular and \u201csustainable visitor economy,\u201d according to Bill Addy, the company\u2019s CEO.\n\nByrne thinks the success and growth of Liverpool FC have come at the cost of residents over time. He wonders whether residents might react as those have in Barcelona, where local unhappiness at the proliferation of Airbnb properties played a part in the Spanish government telling the company in May that it must remove 65,000 property listings in the country for breaching regulations.\n\nA mile or so away, the area surrounding Goodison Park is facing different kinds of problems.\n\nAirbnb does not have as great a presence in Walton, the suburb where Everton's former stadium is located. Neither has it made much of a mark down by the docks, where Everton's new Hill Dickinson Stadium glitters on the banks of the Mersey.\n\nUltimately, Everton could only have stayed in Walton, where Goodison was hemmed in on three sides by the same type of terraced housing as Anfield. But for the club to have expanded to the size of their 53,000-capacity new arena \u2014 13,000 bigger than Goodison, with vastly more hospitality suites \u2014 they would have needed a similarly aggressive expansion policy in the surrounding streets as Liverpool adopted at Anfield.\n\nGoodison Road, Bullens Road (which borders a primary school) and Gwladys Street would probably have had to have met the same fate as Lothair Road and been wiped from the map. Moving two miles west this summer ultimately made both practical and financial sense.\n\nWalton is another deprived district which faces many of Anfield's economic and social problems. Its main thoroughfare, County Road, has long seemed busier than Anfield\u2019s equivalent, Walton Breck Road, which runs past the Kop grandstand, mainly because it is used as an alternative route for motorists travelling north from Liverpool\u2019s city centre. But both needed the lifeblood supplied by their resident football clubs, with the steel-shuttering of many businesses only lifting on a matchday.\n\nEverton have not left the area completely. The club's free school remains on Spellow Lane, and their Everton in the Community charity still operates out of Goodison Park, which is being used by the club\u2019s women\u2019s team for eight of their 11 home games this season. Their two Women's Super League games so far have drawn crowds of 6,473 and 4,313.\n\nThey are more than respectable attendances in the WSL but fall way short of the 39,000 who would regularly squeeze into Goodison for men's games, a point that Dave Bond, the licensee of the nearby Winslow Hotel pub knows only too well.\n\nThe Winslow used to shift 3,000 pints on Everton men's matchdays, with around 90 per cent of trade coming in the hours before kick-off. Now, Bond admits to The Athletic that he might have to close in the next couple of months if footfall remains as low as it is.\n\nBond knew this challenge was coming and tried to get ahead of the problem by organising a 90-seater coach to transport Evertonians to their new home a couple of miles away for each game. He has also provided live music at the Winslow to draw supporters back after matches, but he is currently operating at a loss.\n\nFor each of Everton\u2019s home games this season, the bus has only been a third full and he is already thinking of downsizing. \u201cIt\u2019s all backs to the wall at the moment,\u201d Bond concedes. \u201cI\u2019ll carry on with the buses for as long as I can. I didn\u2019t think it would be this bad.\u201d\n\nUnlike other popular Everton haunts such as The Brick and the Black Horse, the Winslow is not on County Road and this brings additional pressures because it is more out of sight than ever, tucked away in the shadow of the old stadium\u2019s main stand on Goodison Road.\n\nIf it goes and does not return, Everton will lose a piece of history because the pub\u2019s connection to the club is not just through geography. Everton\u2019s greatest goalscorer, Dixie Dean, used to drink there at a time when Jack Borthwick, a former Everton defender, was the licensee. While Norman Greenhalgh, a title winner with Everton in 1939, became landlord in the 1950s, the father of Everton player Neil Robinson, who grew up on Spellow Lane, worked as the head barman.\n\nLater, Joe Royle toasted his appointment as Everton manager in 1994 with 2-0 victory over Liverpool in his first game, as well as a pint in a venue that soon became the home of Everton\u2019s official supporters club. During a tough period in the early 2000s, Kevin Campbell, the team\u2019s centre-forward, called in to discuss the team's form with punters.\n\nEven when Goodison Park was fully operational, there were significant challenges running the Winslow, evidenced by the fact that its previous owner closed the doors for 18 months in 2012 due to financial difficulties. Bond, an Evertonian from Ireland, is desperate to avoid the same outcome, but that will only happen if punters return after they adjust to new routines.\n\nEverton want to help stimulate the regeneration of Vauxhall \u2014 the largely dilapidated dockland area of the city where their new stadium is based \u2014 but with only a few drinking options by the ground, pubs in Liverpool\u2019s business district have benefited the most from their relocation. An area that was once subdued at weekends has been brought alive by the presence of a club that is now only a short-ish walk away.\n\nImpressions of Liverpool as a city have increasingly been formed by the performance of its thriving centre, with less regard for what is happening in districts such as Anfield or Walton. On Saturday, the former Everton right-back Tony Hibbert had a post-match pint in the Winslow and the pub was busy, but it was only what Bond expected.\n\nIn the good old days, the most lucrative game of the season was the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. For this Everton pub, the busiest Saturday of the season is likely to be for the game played at Anfield.\n\nThe changes in Anfield and Walton are not simply felt, but experienced in real terms.\n\nRecent United Kingdom governments have allocated the provision of services to the population. Anfield and Walton are already some of the most deprived districts in the country, and it is reasonable to wonder what the future holds for those who remain and are just trying to get by.\n\nUltimately, the tide feels hard to reverse. Liverpool are a commercial behemoth that just keeps on growing, even if Anfield is probably at its limit in terms of capacity. Everton are some way behind but will hope to close the gap courtesy of their new dockside home. Their combined pulling power has unquestionably helped build Liverpool's brand as a city, and helped deliver the kind of commercial growth that inspires jobs, prosperity and in theory regeneration.\n\nBut there is a tension there, too. While clubs must look after themselves in an increasingly cutthroat economic world, it also feels they owe a debt to the communities of which they form such an integral part. They have identities in their own right and ones that most would consider worth protecting. Liverpool FC, which tried and failed to trademark the name 'Liverpool' in 2019, certainly know the value of being associated with its home city.\n\nPerhaps there is ultimately no perfect conclusion when an institution such as Liverpool, or, indeed, Everton, reaches the point where it needs to expand beyond its boundaries to compete with market forces."

Follow Peak here.\n\nBen Malcolmson was Pete Carroll\u2019s right-hand man for 14 years, first with USC and then with the Seattle Seahawks. He is now the head of investor relations for a financial company.\n\nOne time during our early years together in Seattle, Pete Carroll spoke to several hundred employees at Microsoft. He hadn\u2019t won the Super Bowl with the Seahawks yet, so in a sense, he was still trying to prove himself as an NFL head coach.\n\nAs Pete\u2019s special assistant going back to his USC days, I went with him to his speaking events. By then, I was used to his enthusiasm and beliefs. But this one stuck with me.\n\nDuring his talk that day, Pete asked the room: \u201cHow many people here have a philosophy for life or for work?\u201d\n\nProbably three-quarters of the room raised their hands. Then he asked: \u201cHow many people could tell me that philosophy in one line?\u201d All but three or four arms bashfully went down. Pete called on one of the people who had kept their hand raised and had them share their philosophy in front of the whole room.\n\nOne of Pete\u2019s favorite phrases is \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know who you are,\u201d but I remember going home from that event and thinking: Dang, I hear Pete say this stuff all the time \u2014 what if he asks me? I was in my mid-20s at the time. I realized I didn\u2019t know my own philosophy, and that started me on a journey to figure out who I was.\n\nPete\u2019s a philosopher at heart; he studied philosophy at the University of Pacific and often talked to me about concepts like Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs. His goal for every player, coach or person who works with him is to have them discover and articulate their true self.\n\nEvery year, after assistant coaches returned from vacation in February or March, Pete would meet with them one-on-one. They\u2019d have to share with him: This is who I am. This is my philosophy, for coaching and for life. This is the lens I\u2019m looking through.\n\nThe cool thing is that Pete actually has a loose process to help people figure that out. He made it so approachable that anyone can do it.\n\nSimply take out a piece of paper or open the Notes app on your phone and start writing out how you show up to your family, friends and coworkers. What characteristics define you? How do you want to be described? What virtues resonate the most with you? It may seem daunting at first, but there\u2019s nothing magical to it.\n\nYou have to write it out and then come back to it a few days later, rework it and write it again. It takes several iterations. Before long, you should have a list of a few traits and phrases. Some will rise to the top, and you\u2019ll start to notice themes. It might happen all of a sudden or it might take days, but soon enough, you\u2019ll have a moment where you go, Yes, this is me.\n\nPete didn\u2019t want to over-engineer or micromanage the process. He understood that people\u2019s minds are wired differently. For example, his personal philosophy is \u201cAlways compete.\u201d Two words. His identity for his teams was \u201cGreat effort, great enthusiasm, great toughness, play smart.\u201d It doesn\u2019t have to be as short as two words, but he also didn\u2019t want it to be a 10-page paper.\n\nAfter going through this process, I landed on three main characteristics \u2014 kindness, joy, peace \u2014 and two ways I want people to describe me: a man of character and a great husband/father/friend. These identity affirmations and aspirations have been on the lock screen of my phone ever since.\n\nThat deep level of knowing who you are carries so much power because that\u2019s where consistency comes from. When you live, work and operate consistently, excellence flows out of that.\n\nI saw this firsthand with Pete. He is all about emotional regularity and consistency, and his consistency comes from knowing who he is. The temporal things that come and go \u2014 the wins and losses, the third-down failures, the turnovers \u2014 don\u2019t carry as much weight.\n\nThe story I always think about: In February 2014, the Seahawks crushed Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos, the best offense in the history of the NFL at the time, in the Super Bowl. On the Monday morning after the game, we were on the bus headed to the airport to fly back to Seattle. Pete was obviously happy, but he wasn\u2019t jumping off the walls. He was just happy. Normal.\n\nNot even a full year later, we lost the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots with a last-second interception on the 1-yard line. On the Monday morning after the game, we were on the bus headed to the airport again. We had just lost the Super Bowl in one of the most heartbreaking ways possible, if not the most heartbreaking way. Pete was obviously sad, but he wasn\u2019t destroyed as though his life was over.\n\nHe was still Pete. He still had the same light in his eyes, the same countenance. And it\u2019s because he did the work to know that his true self is never based on a win-loss record but on far greater things.\n\nDavid Brooks wrote a book called \u201cThe Road to Character\u201d that Pete strongly recommended to coaches and even some players. In that book, Brooks talks about eulogy virtues versus resume virtues. When someone gives a eulogy, they\u2019re not reading someone\u2019s resume or talking about their accomplishments \u2014 they\u2019re talking about who that person truly was. Pete loved that. He was like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get more people on the team to read this because this is what it\u2019s really all about.\u201d\n\nI first started this process 10 or 15 years ago. It was the biggest way Pete impacted me, and what\u2019s cool is I continue to live it out today, even applying it to my job now in finance. You may tweak it, but it\u2019s not like you scrap it every year and create a new one. It\u2019s such an empowering thing because you live from this amazing clarity: clarity of vision, clarity of purpose, clarity of identity.\n\nIt takes a little bit of work, but it\u2019s beyond worth it. As Pete says to his teams, \u201cJust be you, and that will always be enough.\u201d\n\n\u2014 As told to Jayson Jenks\n\n(Illustration: Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic; Photo courtesy of Caden Briquelet)"

His extensive background and collaborative approach are expected to bring valuable insights to Villa as they seek to enhance their performance in the Premier League.",
                "source": "nytimes",
                "text": "A version of this article was first published in November 2024.\n\nRoberto Olabe, who is set to join Aston Villa as the Premier League club\u2019s new sporting director, is perhaps best known for his excellent recent work at Real Sociedad.\n\nBut he left that position at the end of last season, and it is far from the only role to have shaped him.\n\nOlabe has extensive experience from more than two decades working in various different jobs at several La Liga clubs. The 57-year-old\u2019s CV also includes time helping Qatar prepare for the 2022 World Cup, and guiding the development of Ecuador\u2019s current \u2018golden generation\u2019 of players.\n\nOver his career, the ex-goalkeeper has also worked closely with fellow former Real Sociedad figures now in top managerial posts across Europe, including Xabi Alonso, Mikel Arteta and Villa boss Unai Emery \u2014 who Olabe hired as Almeria manager in 2006.\n\nOlabe had been under contract in San Sebastian until June 2026, but The Athletic revealed back in November that he would be leaving his post 12 months early. Back then, we spoke to around a dozen sources who know him and his work, all speaking anonymously to protect relationships.\n\nThey gave valuable insight into the character and working methods of a man now set for a new big job at Villa.\n\nBorn in the Basque city of Vitoria-Gasteiz in 1967, Olabe began his playing career with third-tier Mirandes, spent time in the lower divisions with hometown club Alaves, then moved to Salamanca before joining Real Sociedad in 1995.\n\nDuring four seasons with the club, Olabe was mostly a back-up in a squad that included more than a dozen players who would later become managers \u2014 including Emery at Aston Villa, ex-Leeds, Valencia and Watford manager Javi Gracia, current Mallorca boss Jagoba Arrasate and former Real Sociedad coach Imanol Alguacil.\n\nAfter retiring as a player in 1999, Olabe coached Real Sociedad\u2019s under-18 team to a national title. Midway through the 2001-02 season he was promoted to replace John Toshack with the senior side and guided them to safety after they were facing the threat of relegation.\n\nMoving upstairs for three years as sporting director, Olabe put together a squad that almost won the 2002-03 La Liga title. A teenage Xabi Alonso became a first-team regular during this time, while a 22-year-old Arteta signed from Rangers.\n\nThere then followed short spells in different roles within Spanish football. During a year as Almeria sporting director he appointed Emery as coach, signed 17 players and got promotion to La Liga. He had a spell working as a senior executive at La Liga leading various projects including the development of youth players and aiding the education of coaches in Central America. He also coached Real Union in the third tier for the 2011-12 campaign \u2014 now owned by Villa.\n\nOlabe\u2019s longest career spell outside of San Sebastian was four years as director of football at Qatar\u2019s Aspire Group, where his remit was to develop the structures to prepare a competitive team for when the Gulf country hosted the 2022 World Cup.\n\n\u201cThe proposal was to design the football department,\u201d Olabe told The Athletic before that tournament. \u201cThen developing a methodology for training, generating the right competitive mentality and changing the sporting culture. Everything was related to 2022. It was a challenge but also a great opportunity.\u201d\n\nOlabe began that project but in August 2016 he returned to Real Sociedad as sporting director. Within eight months, he left and was soon afterwards appointed as head of sporting strategy at Ecuadorian side Independiente del Valle (who also had an official connection to Qatar\u2019s Aspire). There, he helped build the youth system which has produced senior stars including Chelsea\u2019s Moises Caicedo and Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s Piero Hincapie, now on loan at Arsenal.\n\nOn Olabe\u2019s return to Real Sociedad in 2018 for a third spell as sporting director, long-serving club president Jokin Aperribay gave him wide-ranging powers, from youth development to transfers. The result was the team\u2019s most successful period since the early 1980s.\n\nLong-serving veterans Xabi Prieto and Imanol Agirretxe were treated honourably while being moved on. Bets on promising youngsters Alexander Isak, Martin Odegaard and Mikel Merino paid off. Youth products Mikel Oyarzabal, Martin Zubimendi and Robin Le Normand became first-team pillars. Ex-Premier League veterans David Silva and Nacho Monreal brought experience and leadership. Coach Alguacil was promoted from the B team to the senior side and given time to work within a context he knew well.\n\nInside Spanish football, Real Sociedad were generally admired as a club that did things correctly and smartly during this time, as they overtook historically bigger rivals such as Valencia and Sevilla, where decisions were made more erratically.\n\nFor many observers, a key to Real Sociedad\u2019s success was how everyone at the club \u2014 including president, sporting director, coach and senior players \u2014 were all very aligned in what they were doing. Steady progress culminated in a first trophy in three decades when eight home-produced players featured as the club beat Basque rivals Athletic Bilbao in the 2020 Copa del Rey final (played behind closed doors in April 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic).\n\nOff the pitch, Real Sociedad were also progressing. Olabe had a central role as the club\u2019s Zubieta training ground was expanded. A unified player development model was implemented across the men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams at all levels, with an emphasis on playing good technical football at a rapid pace. Alonso spent three years at Zubieta learning what he needed to become a top coach, before leaving for Bayer Leverkusen, and this summer joining Real Madrid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that (all our coaches) understand our model of development, and that they are aligned with our model of play,\u201d Olabe told The Athletic in 2021. \u201cThen each is free to add their own finishing touches. Xabi maybe likes to be more stable, with his own profile, have more midfield play. Imanol maybe is more eclectic. But we are all very similar and they all understand they are part of this model.\u201d\n\nThe 2023-24 campaign was Real Sociedad\u2019s first in the Champions League in a decade, the result of stability and long-term planning. Alguacil\u2019s well-drilled team topped a group with Inter Milan, Benfica and Red Bull Salzburg, but hit a ceiling against the much richer Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16.\n\n\u201cWe want to be the best Real Sociedad possible, not to copy anybody else,\u201d Olabe told The Athletic before that PSG tie. \u201cWe know it is very difficult to win trophies, very few teams do. What makes us better is to be the best version of ourselves every day. To try, with this identity, to take on the challenges that are put in front of us. That will make us stronger and better.\u201d\n\nReal Sociedad\u2019s progress was built on profits in transfer dealings during Olabe\u2019s most recent spell. While head of scouting Erik Bretos did a lot of the work in identifying targets, market sources say Olabe was a tough negotiator who \u201cdoes not suffer fools\u201d and always looks for an advantage for his club.\n\nIsak was sold to Newcastle United for \u20ac70million (\u00a361.7m, $82.6m) in 2022, having arrived from Borussia Dortmund for \u20ac10m three years earlier. Merino cost just \u20ac12m from Newcastle United in 2018, and brought in \u20ac32m from Arsenal last summer after impressing at Euro 2024 for Spain. Another of that Euros-winning squad, centre-half Le Normand, was sold to Atletico Madrid for \u20ac34.5m.\n\nHowever, those departures led to an \u2018end-of-cycle\u2019 feeling. Not all recent signings have worked out \u2014 Japan playmaker Takefusa Kubo for \u20ac6.5m was a hit but Nigerian striker Umar Sadiq for a club-record \u20ac20m has not been so far. The relationship between former team-mates Olabe and Alguacil \u2014 both intense characters \u2014 also had its strained moments. The sporting director\u2019s relationship with the dressing room was characterised by one source as \u201ccordial and professional\u201d, with president Aperribay a warmer figure with the players.\n\nReal Sociedad finished 11th in La Liga last term, also reaching the Copa del Rey semi-finals and the Europa League last 16, losing to Manchester United.\n\nEmery and Villa first considered bringing Olabe to the Premier League in summer 2023, but in the end Monchi was hired from Sevilla as their sporting director.\n\nSome who know him well see him more as a manager or implementer of a general strategy and philosophy throughout a club, rather than solely scouting or signing first-team players. He is used to working with wide autonomy and power to make decisions, within a well-defined structure.\n\nSuch conditions are not often found at top Premier League clubs with rich owners (whether individuals or nation states). Another industry source wondered whether his breadth of experience would make him a good fit for owners implementing a multi-club model across leagues or continents.\n\nOthers who have followed his career closely say he is sensitive to criticism and does not always enjoy the media spotlight. He is most comfortable when given time and space to do what he thinks is the correct thing over the long term \u2014 not always the conditions available at the very top level in football.\n\nOne thing for sure is he will be missed at Real Sociedad. Back in November, when news of his departure was confirmed, one former team-mate said he was sad, but was sure that Olabe would be a success whatever his next step.\n\n\u201cFirstly, I\u2019d like Roberto Olabe to stay many more years at La Real as he is doing great work there,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo speak of Roberto Olabe is to speak of responsibility, hard work, dedication, determination and great quality on a professional and personal level. He\u2019s always been a very analytical and reflective person. He knows the market well and looks after the youth system. Wherever he goes, he would have no problem, with his experience and capability.\u201d\n\n(Top photo: Real Sociedad TV)"

                "text": "We sent 14 testers out in the winter to go hiking, running, cross-country skiing, and downhill skiing, as well as to shovel snow. And we recommend the Ridge Merino Aspect Midweight Merino Wool Base Layer Long Sleeve Shirt, for men and women. The Aspect shirt offers the most versatile styling for casual and recreational use, and it\u2019s warm yet breathable.\n\nWhat about base-layer bottoms? We discovered that most people engaged in such vigorous outdoor activities will overheat when wearing base-layer bottoms unless temps are well below freezing. Most of our base-layer shirt picks have matching pants (though we didn't test them); if you really need a pair, try those.\n\nIn this guide\u2019s title, we refer to these layers as \u201cthermal underwear\u201d because that\u2019s what most people search for when they\u2019re looking for something to wear while they\u2019re active. And that\u2019s what base layers are: clothing that helps to regulate body heat by managing moisture while you\u2019re active.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for classic cotton long johns with a matching top\u2014better suited to lounging around the house than running outdoors\u2014you\u2019ll find those in our guide to pajamas.\n\nThe Ridge Merino Aspect Midweight Wool Base Layer Long Sleeve Shirt, for men and women, is our most versatile pick, due to its breathable, merino-based blend and understated look. This is a city-to-trail shirt because it can navigate cold-weather running, skiing, backpacking, and work (plus dinner out afterward) equally well. Also, it\u2019s reasonably priced.\n\nThis shirt\u2019s fit is on the slim side. But, unlike some of the competition, the Aspect shirt is not so tight that it can be pigeonholed solely as an outdoor performance piece. It comes in enough basic colors to work with most of your wardrobe.\n\nThe merino wool manages cold-weather sweating, and some nylon helps with durability and shape retention after stretching.\n\nAlthough this shirt comes in a wider range of sizes than many competitors, there is still room for larger offerings. If you end up with the wrong size and need to return it, Ridge Merino is the only company among our picks that offers free returns, including a return label, to ensure that you get the right fit.\n\nThe Aspect shirt is machine-washable, but since it\u2019s mostly merino wool, the company recommends air-drying it to preserve the merino fibers and extend the garment\u2019s lifespan.\n\nThe REI Co-op Midweight Base Long-Sleeve Base Layer Top, for men and women, is the best synthetic alternative to our top pick. It costs less, too, and for those who want a softer fabric\u2014at the expense of some odor control and slightly lower-performing moisture management\u2014it could be a good choice. It looks more like underwear than our top pick, though, so it may not be as versatile.\n\nThe REI Co-op Midweight shirt is made from synthetic fibers, which typically dry faster than merino because they don\u2019t soak up water as much as hollow merino fibers. However, the midweight fabric is a little heavier than that of our top picks, and the drying time was only slightly better when we were actively sweating in it. Though some synthetic fabrics can be more breathable than merino\u2014the knit pattern and tightness largely determine how well a base layer dumps excess heat\u2014the REI Co-op Midweight shirt breathed a little less effectively than our top pick.\n\nSince this shirt lacks the natural odor control of merino wool, it may need to be washed more often than our top pick. But the REI Co-op Midweight can go in a home dryer, so it's easier to launder.\n\nREI\u2019s returns window is 365 days for members and 90 days for nonmembers; this is the longest window we found. However, if you don\u2019t live close enough to an REI store to return an item in person, note that REI charges a fee for a mailing label.\n\nThe REI Co-op Midweight shirt comes in a wider size range, for both men and women, than our top pick; there are also some tall options for men.\n\nThe Minus33 Midweight Merino Wool shirt, for men and women, is actually a heavier option than either the Ridge Merino Aspect or the REI Co-op Midweight base layers. The Minus33 Midweight shirt\u2019s fabric works better in less-sweaty situations, such as everyday, around-town use; fairly stationary styles of hunting or fishing; or resort skiing and snowboarding on very cold days (when you\u2019re wearing all of your layers to stay warm on the lifts). The Minus33 shirt is a little more expensive than our top pick, but you end up with a warmer shirt.\n\nThis base layer is also available in a quarter-zip style for men and women.\n\nThe Minus33 base layer is the only 100% merino wool option among our picks. This shirt\u2019s fabric isn\u2019t as durable as shirts made with a merino-and-nylon blend (like the Ridge Merino Aspect) or a synthetic (such as the REI Co-op Midweight). And the Minus33 shirt\u2019s fabric doesn\u2019t retain its shape as well. But the thicker fabric helps mitigate those drawbacks. Also, air-drying will prolong this shirt\u2019s life, as it does for the Ridge Merino Aspect shirt.\n\nThe Minus33 shirt fits the most loosely of our picks, too. So it\u2019s not as good at moisture management as more form-fitting options, like our picks from REI Co-op and (even more so) Ridge Merino. However, due to its looser fit, this shirt has the most casual fit for daily wear.\n\nAmong our picks, the Minus33 shirt offers the largest overall size\u2014up to a 61-inch chest (size 6X) for the men\u2019s version. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t true of the women\u2019s version, which goes up to a 47-inch chest (size 3X) only."

Despite FIFA President Gianni Infantino's assertion that the event occurred without incident, reports included issues related to fan safety, accessibility, and discrimination, prompting FIFA to launch several investigations. Additionally, South Africa's qualification for the World Cup is in jeopardy due to fielding an ineligible player, potentially impacting their standings in the African qualification phase.",
                "source": "nytimes",
                "text": "FIFA received 145 reports relating to human rights concerns at the Club World Cup in the United States, many of which were complaints submitted by supporters through the governing body\u2019s own grievance mechanism portal. The highest number related to fans expressing concerns about U.S. government policies or their enforcement, with the second-most coming from fans who suffered from extreme heat during the tournament.\n\nThe grievance mechanism is in place for supporters who wish to express concerns about the organization or the experience at FIFA-led events. Some reports were received via the portal, some fans used FIFA\u2019s human rights email address, and others were made on-site by venue teams reporting into FIFA.\n\nIn a closing speech to this summer\u2019s Club World Cup, held in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, the FIFA president Gianni Infantino claimed the tournament passed by without \u201cone single incident\u201d and said \u201ceverything happened in a joyful atmosphere.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to multiple people with knowledge of the situation, all of whom wished to remain anonymous to protect relationships, 145 reports were raised with FIFA by those attending the tournament and were deemed sufficiently important to be addressed.\n\nThese included 37 complaints categorized as being related to federal policies or enforcement. Some of these included fans raising concerns as to whether the tournament and next summer\u2019s World Cup should be held in the U.S., citing the actions, policies and words of the administration under President Trump. Other complaints centred on alleged sightings of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials at stadiums during the tournament.\n\nIn a statement to The Athletic, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said that despite the reports made to FIFA, neither ICE nor CPB conducted enforcement, describing it as \u201canother case of fear-mongering.\u201d\n\nThe Club World Cup took place in the U.S. this summer amid significant national and international attention towards the Trump administration\u2019s use of ICE in federal immigration raids. Before the tournament began, the CBP announced on its Facebook page that its agents would be \u201csuited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games\u201d \u2014 a post that was taken down after FIFA officials expressed concerns to the CBP about the reaction it had provoked. A CBP spokesman previously told The Athletic that its professionals are involved in coordinating emergency preparedness for major sporting events, while also saying that U.S. Border Patrol was involved in planning and coordination.\n\nFollowing complaints by supporters, FIFA sought to find out from ICE whether it was operative at the stadiums during the tournament, but FIFA says it was told by the White House Task Force for the World Cup that this was not the case.\n\nA DHS spokesperson told The Athletic: \u201cNeither ICE nor CBP conducted any enforcement during the FIFA Club World Cup. This is another case of fear-mongering. Federal Law enforcement was critical in securing the event and helped keep it safe for everyone involved, as they do with every major sporting event, including the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nAmong the other complaints submitted by supporters were concerns about extreme heat \u2014 a repeated controversy during the tournament. One game in Cincinnati, Ohio, was so hot that Borussia Dortmund\u2019s substitutes watched the game indoors and a multitude of players complained about the heat, particularly in games scheduled for midday and during the afternoon, a pattern that seems likely to repeat itself at the World Cup next summer. The Athletic reported in June how long lines formed at some venues for a small number of water fountains, with expensive concession prices for bottles of water, while some fans tried to move seats or move indoors at some of the games during the heatwave. FIFA opened 25 investigations following reports about conditions deemed unsafe by fans due to the heat.\n\nOther investigations included 20 or more complaints about accessibility issues and discrimination. The discrimination reports are particularly notable after FIFA decided to reduce messaging around its racism, discrimination and inclusion campaigns in stadiums and on social media during the tournament, for reasons it has never publicly explained, but campaigners have questioned whether it is linked to the Trump administration\u2019s stance on cutting DEI initiatives.\n\nFIFA also opened a dozen complaints relating to workers\u2019 rights, as well as just under 10 safeguarding issues. There were five investigations into harassment, as well as four in the freedom of speech category and alleged excessive use of force. Three complaints were made about an alleged failure to provide for freedom of religion, which included concerns about a lack of prayer rooms made available in stadiums.\n\nDespite Infantino\u2019s claim of no incidents, supporters at Monterrey\u2019s Club World Cup last-16 game against Borussia Dortmund were warned by FIFA that the game could be suspended after homophobic chants were heard repeatedly during the second half, while Real Madrid\u2019s Antonio Rudiger also alleged he was racially abused by Pachuca defender Gustavo Cabral, a claim denied by the Argentine. An investigation into that incident was closed because of a lack of evidence, the Associated Press reported earlier this month.\n\nIn a statement, FIFA told The Athletic: \u201cIn line with previous FIFA tournaments, FIFA has implemented a human rights due diligence system around the recent FIFA Club World Cup, including a reporting mechanism, and established processes to address every report. FIFA\u2019s receipt of and response to these human rights reports is a positive indicator of sound human rights due diligence. Every tournament of this magnitude brings alleged human rights issues, and it is FIFA\u2019s responsibility as a serious governing body and competition organizer to address them in a professional and timely manner.\u201d\n\nPolice told not to take time off during World Cup\n\nPreparations for next summer\u2019s World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico are stepping up, and the planning extends to the police departments across the host cities, 11 of which are in the United States.\n\nThe policing and security of the operation is almost entirely the responsibility of the host cities, according to a copy of Seattle and New York/New Jersey\u2019s host city agreements with FIFA, which have been seen by The Athletic and would likely be largely reflective of agreements across the country. The host cities have undertaken to ensure police escorts are available for teams and referees, but also for FIFA president Infantino and \u201cother VIP members of the FIFA delegation\u201d or \u201cVIP members identified by FIFA.\u201d More broadly, the cities must handle a 39-day competition that will not only see a significant number of games in their territory, but also fan festivals and the heightened footfall and risk associated with major tournaments across their cities. It will also coincide with the 250th anniversary of the United States Declaration of Independence.\n\nAs such, some police departments have decided their officers must not take vacation days during the entirety of the tournament.\n\nA public information officer for the Kansas City Police Department told The Athletic that officers will have a \u201cwindow of time during the events that we are not allowed to take what we call \u2018exception time\u2019, which includes vacation or other elective days off.\u201d\n\nThe Dallas TV station WFAA also reported in February that the then-police chief Michael Igo had informed his department that \u201cno discretionary leave will be approved\u201d leading up to and during the World Cup. Due to the stretched demand on resources, staff were told they would not have holiday approved between May 28, 2026, to July 26, 2026. The Dallas Police Department declined to comment.\n\nThe Santa Clara Police Department, which takes the lead for the World Cup games at Levi\u2019s Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area, is taking a similar approach, but says employees have taken a voluntary decision to avoid time off.\n\nLieutenant Eric Lagergren told The Athletic: \u201cTo ensure the Santa Clara Police Department achieves its priority of public safety, we will be implementing an operational strategy that requires the full commitment of our personnel. Recognizing the significant lift involved, employees have voluntarily agreed to be at the discretion of the department for reorganization during this period. This reorganization will span four weeks and will culminate with the city of Santa Clara\u2019s 250th July 4 celebration. In order to maintain the necessary staffing levels, vacations will not be permitted during this operational period.\u201d\n\nThe New York Police Department, which will be involved in planning and coordinating around events and games at MetLife Stadium and fan festivals in New York City, said its plans are still being formed, while the Los Angeles Police Department said it does not discuss security measures for any event. \u201cWe will be sufficiently deployed and prepared,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s World Cup return jeopardised\n\nSouth Africa have not appeared at a men\u2019s World Cup since the country hosted the tournament in 2010. However, they are currently top of Group C in the African qualification phase after eight games with two left to play, against Rwanda and Zimbabwe.\n\nSouth Africa have 17 points, three clear of second-placed Benin and six clear of Nigeria in third and Rwanda in fourth. The winners of each of the nine African groups automatically qualify for the World Cup. However, only the four best second-placed finishers (the teams with the most points who finish second across the nine groups) then get a second bite of the cherry by entering a play-off round, with only one additional nation securing a place at the tournament. In short, therefore, finishing top is important.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s position, however, has suddenly become perilous because it has emerged that the team fielded an ineligible player by playing midfielder Teboho Mokoena during the 2-0 win over Lesotho in a group-stage qualifier in March. He was not permitted to play, having received two yellow cards previously in qualification, which equals an automatic one-match suspension.\n\nSouth Africa Football Association (SAFA) chief executive Lydia Monyepao told reporters last week that SAFA had received correspondence from FIFA on the matter.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are preparing our response to the FIFA disciplinary committee because that is what ultimately is required from us as an association.\u201d\n\nAccording to FIFA\u2019s rule book, its disciplinary code says: \u201cIf a team fields a player who is not eligible to participate (due to suspension, registration issues, nationality, etc.), the match is automatically forfeited. The default result is a 3-0 loss, unless the actual result was even more disadvantageous to the offending team.\u201d\n\nSAFA and FIFA declined to comment when approached by The Athletic.\n\nTheir rivals have sought to capitalise, with the group potentially being thrown wide open should South Africa lose points.\n\n\u201cIt is nothing less than is expected,\u201d said Nigerian Football Federation director of communications Ademola Olajire, in quotes reported by ESPN.\n\n\u201cThey have started a process that should have started maybe a little earlier and we now await the outcome.\u201d\n\nBenin, who would be best-placed to take advantage and move level on points with South Africa, have been critical. Their coach, Gernot Rohr, was reported by the media in Benin to have said: \u201cFIFA should now very quickly give the decision.\u201d\n\nWill other mayoral candidates follow Mamdani\u2019s ticketing lead?\n\nThe New York City mayoral race will be decided on election day on November 4, and Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani, who is leading the polls, last week sought to broaden his voter base by appealing to FIFA to reverse its decision to adopt dynamic pricing when selling tickets for the World Cup.\n\nWhile the World Cup final will be held at MetLife Stadium in neighbouring New Jersey, FIFA\u2019s hosting agreement is with both New York City and New Jersey, which is why it is also the domain of the New York City mayor. Earlier this month, The Athletic revealed Mamdani\u2019s FIFA campaign, which subsequently launched with a video across social media.\n\nMamdani\u2019s petition, which highlighted that non-hospitality tickets will be on sale for as much as $6,000 (\u00a35,200), also asked FIFA to impose a cap on its resale platform to avoid fans being charged astronomical fees where there is expected to be huge demand for the tournament. This was underlined by FIFA announcing on Friday that over 4.5 million people had entered the pre-sale draw for the first phase of ticket sales. Mamdani has also asked FIFA to keep 15 per cent of tickets aside for local residents at a discounted rate, to ensure that the sport is accessible and captures new audiences.\n\nMamdani\u2019s position, however, may not be shared by his mayoral rivals. The campaign for Andrew Cuomo did not respond to an email from The Athletic asking if he has a position on the matter.\n\nA statement by a spokesperson for the current New York City mayor, Eric Adams, who is standing for re-election, did not directly address any of the issues raised by Mamdani, saying only that they want \u201cevery New Yorker to be able to get in on the fun.\u201d\n\nIt read: \u201cMayor Adams is proud to have ensured that New York City will be welcoming the world as the host of the FIFA World Cup next year \u2014 including securing the generation-defining final. Thanks to our administration\u2019s work, more than one million people will visit our city, shop in our stores, and dine in our restaurants \u2014 with the tournaments generating over $2billion in revenue and creating 14,000 new jobs across the region. This once-in-a-lifetime celebration will create unforgettable moments right here in our backyard, and we want every New Yorker to be able to get in on the fun.\u201d\n\nSources close to Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey, who wished to remain anonymous because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter, said he has no current plans to challenge FIFA on dynamic pricing, but that the governor will speak to whichever candidate wins the election and they will work closely together as partners.\n\n(Top photo: Alex Pantling \u2013 FIFA via Getty Images)"

                "text": "Updated September 23, 2025\n\nBy Kase Wickman\n\nThere\u2019s a common joke among people who do crafts: One hobby is the craft itself, the other is buying supplies.\n\nStepping into a craft store can be overwhelming, and it\u2019s often the beginning of a slippery slope toward gear and material overload. It can feel like there\u2019s too much stuff to get and too many skills to learn before you even make a single stitch on that embroidery, knitting, or crochet pattern you have your eye on.\n\nAn all-in-one craft kit can help you escape the temptation. Whether you want to learn a new skill, give a one-of-a-kind gift, or scroll a little less on your phone during evening TV time, there\u2019s a fiber-arts craft kit that\u2019s ideal for you.\n\nI spent more than 100 hours researching and testing kits for cross-stitch, embroidery, knitting, and crochet to find favorite all-inclusive fiber-arts craft kits designed for adults. (No cheesy cartoon characters here.) I visited shops, polled fellow hobbyists, and searched the web for the latest and greatest all-in-one kits, and then I put them to the test.\n\nThe research\n\nA start-from-zero crochet kit: The Woobles\n\nTop pick\n\nExhaustive step-by-step videos and a head start on the first stitches make it simple to start crocheting with zero previous experience. The kit does not come with printed patterns, but they are downloadable.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Beginner crocheters and up.\n\nWhat\u2019s included: Each kit from The Woobles comes with a crochet hook, a project that\u2019s already been cast on and marked with stitch markers, any safety eyes or extra yarn colors necessary for the project, a tapestry needle for finishing, and a card with a scannable QR code to navigate to the pattern\u2019s instructions.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: I completed Pierre the Penguin\u2014one of the company\u2019s best sellers\u2014without having ever crocheted a stitch previously.\n\nThese projects are virtually idiot-proof: The instructional videos go over everything from how to hold the yarn and hook to casting off the final stitch of the project, and they are segmented to give you time to complete each step before you click forward.\n\nI made my palm-size penguin over a weekend, feeling an immense sense of achievement (and screeching \u201cMy son!\u201d at anyone who would listen while thrusting him in their faces). I already have my eye on some of The Woobles\u2019s other kits, such as a little pink dinosaur that I think would make a lovely addition to my fiber flock.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThese kits don\u2019t come with a printed pattern, though you can obtain the written-out pattern via scanning a QR code. And as useful as the tutorial videos are, they may not be great for people who aren\u2019t visual learners.\n\nFinally, these kits are definitely for beginners: To a person who already knows how to crochet, the instructions are overkill, and the price is likely to seem high for the materials included.\n\nLearn to knit in style: Purl Soho Learn To Knit\n\nTop pick\n\nHigh-end yarn, beautifully designed instructions with online tutorials, and three dozen color choices make this an especially giftable (though pricey) beginner knitting experience.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Beginner knitters and up.\n\nWhat\u2019s included: This kit teaches you to knit with a large, detailed instruction book that includes color photos and links to video tutorials. It comes with two skeins of yarn, wooden knitting needles, and a tapestry needle.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: New York City\u2019s Purl Soho is a fancy, crafty wonderland\u2014as if the Coastal Grandmother aesthetic were a yarn store. So it\u2019s no wonder that the shop\u2019s Learn To Knit Kit feels especially luxurious.\n\nThe included yarn is 100% merino wool, bucatini-fat and squishy, the kind that makes you insist that people touch it for themselves. The instructions take would-be knitters through knitting a basic scarf from the very beginning (as in \u201chere\u2019s how you wind a ball of yarn on your hands\u201d) to weaving in the ends of the yarn and blocking.\n\nPurl Soho\u2019s kit currently offers 36 shades of yarn to choose from, and the instructions give detailed steps and examples of three different patterns\u2014including garter, rib, and seed stitches\u2014to use for the scarf. The store also offers oodles of free patterns and informative blog posts, a fantastic resource for future projects and troubleshooting.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that this kit comes at a premium price, but the materials are obviously high-quality.\n\nA classic embroidery pattern with a twist: Jessica Long \u201cThis Took Forever\u201d\n\nTop pick\n\nThorough instructions, an interesting pattern, and a generous amount of well-presented supplies should help you feel accomplished, even if this is your first project.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Beginner stitchers and up.\n\nWhat\u2019s included: Each kit contains fabric with a preprinted pattern, plain backing fabric, an embroidery needle, a wooden embroidery hoop, a labeled thread card with lengths of every color used in the project, color pattern-specific instructions with photos, and a beginner embroidery guide.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: At first glance, this pattern looks like a tangle of florals and vines, but as it comes together it reveals a cheeky \u201cThis took forever\u201d message in the middle. But in spite of the name, it\u2019s less daunting than it may initially appear.\n\nThe instructions are so thorough that they recommend a specific order for stitching the different elements and come complete with a key pointing out exactly which stitches and colors to use where. As a result, finishing the complex-looking pattern is very approachable for stitchers of any level.\n\nThe pattern, as in all of Jessica Long\u2019s kits, comes preprinted on fabric, making the embroidery experience akin to painting by numbers. The kit also includes a labeled thread card with appropriate but not skimpy lengths of each of the necessary shades threaded through. It makes the project that much more compact, so you can slip it into a gallon-size zip-top bag and take it on the go.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThis kit was thoughtfully designed and had everything I needed to complete the project, both physically and instructionally. It was a pleasure to stitch, and I have no notes about drawbacks.\n\nA decidedly alternative embroidery option: Dropcloth Drawing Stitches\n\nTop pick\n\nThis artfully messy sampler allows stitchers to practice and try new techniques while creating an art piece that feels totally personal and customized.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Beginner/intermediate stitchers and up (recommended alongside another project).\n\nWhat\u2019s included: In this complete kit you\u2019ll find fabric with a preprinted pattern, an embroidery needle, a wooden hoop, three random skeins of embroidery floss, a Dropcloth pin, a bonus mini sampler, a free Creativebug class trial card, and a starter guide to some of the stitches used.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: If you do any kind of fiber-based craft long enough, you\u2019ll learn that scraps are unavoidable. And if you\u2019re anything like me, you won\u2019t dare to throw out that random strand of embroidery floss\u2014what if it\u2019s exactly what you need for something someday, and you tossed it without thinking? A tragedy.\n\nDropcloth\u2019s samplers solve that dilemma, providing sketchbook-style starting points for artfully messy samplers that let stitchers practice any number of offbeat techniques while using up those precious scraps.\n\nThe company offers many sampler designs, but this one focuses on various textures and filling techniques. Whereas other projects feature a design to be completed, this one is there when you want to mess around with a stitch. And when it\u2019s finished, it\u2019s totally frameable.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThough the kit comes with a code for a trial of online classes that will level up your stitch lexicon, it would be nice to have diagrams that show a basic method for all the stitches on the sampler, rather than only the four that are currently included.\n\nOne of the three randomly selected skeins I received in my kit was white, which stood in less-than-thrilling contrast against the off-white background of the pattern. I used other thread that I had on hand, making the sampler a true stash-busting project.\n\nNote: This sampler makes a great companion to other stitching projects, so you might prefer to spend a little less and get the sampler alone instead of splurging for the kit; then you can use whatever floss and yarn you have on hand. The hoops and needles are usable across projects. The extra mini sampler and goodies in the kit are nice but not essential.\n\nA designy embroidery project: Hook, Line & Tinker Sardines\n\nTop pick\n\nThis two-color design has the look of a plate that you might find in a cool home-goods store\u2014hanging it in your house is less fusty, more chic. Downloadable stitch tutorials go beyond the included instructions.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Beginner-plus stitchers.\n\nWhat\u2019s included: Each kit contains a needle, a wooden hoop, several full skeins of both required colors of embroidery floss, a piece of fabric with the pattern preprinted, and printed color instructions.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: The question I get most often about my embroidery projects is a semi-dubious \u201cWhat will you do with it when you\u2019re done?\u201d\n\nNot so with this design, which looks like something one might grab in Anthropologie\u2019s home section for the gallery wall in a super-chic apartment. The pattern is simple enough to be soothing but complex enough to be interesting, and the variety of stitch sizes adds even more visual pizzazz.\n\nA color instructions page points out which stitches go where, and it includes a prominent web address that leads you to a downloadable PDF stitch guide. A separate pamphlet in English and French provides more general tips for starting and finishing the piece, as well as gentle reminders to embrace imperfections in your work.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nIt would be great if the stitch diagrams were printed and included in the kit, but the helpful PDF is the next-best thing.\n\nFor those drawn to the mystical: Rikrack Lunar Moth\n\nTop pick\n\nMonotone thread against a bright teal background creates an attention-grabbing effect. The kit and the finished project are equally giftable, especially for a friend who\u2019s a little into crystals.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Beginner embroiderers.\n\nWhat\u2019s included: This embroidery kit includes a wooden hoop, a needle, full skeins of embroidery floss, and color instructions with illustrations of the stitches required.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: The visual style of Rikrack\u2019s designs\u2014a single color of embroidery thread set against a high-contrast solid background\u2014is undeniably striking, and their motifs are almost tarot-esque. This kit includes plenty of thread and is approachable but not at all boring to work on.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nOn its website, Rikrack includes helpful close-up photos of each part of the kit and more in-depth tutorials, but the single-line mention of this useful information is easy to miss in the instructions. It would be great if the same info were included in printed form, as well.\n\nNot all crochet is old-fashioned: Wool and the Gang Wanderer Bag\n\nTop pick\n\nThis cool crochet bag is easy to complete and doesn\u2019t look like an antique. The kit has everything you need, including a clasp and a sewing needle to attach it.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Ambitious beginner crocheters.\n\nWhat\u2019s included: Each kit offers a printed instruction book (in English, French, and German), a crochet hook, a clasp and sewing needle, and all the yarn required for the project.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: Wearable crochet patterns tend toward the kitchsy or retro\u2014think big, boxy cardigans or throw blankets. But more modern-looking patterns for everyday wear can be harder to find.\n\nWool and the Gang comes to the rescue with plenty of stylish options, including the Wanderer Bag, a slouchy raffia purse. The pattern is approachable for a beginner\u2014this was my second-ever crochet project\u2014and the raffia \u201cyarn\u201d (it\u2019s actually paper) was a fun novelty that was satisfying to work up.\n\nThe finished purse is chic and professional-looking, the instructions are thorough, and the added illustrated tutorials on different techniques are handy.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nOn this particular pattern, the diagram for sewing the finished pieces together could have been clearer, but with a slouchy bag like this, you have plenty of wiggle room in how you choose to do it.\n\nFor the traditionalist with a touch of sass: Subversive Cross Stitch Can You Not\n\nTop pick\n\nThis pillow cover shows that cross-stitch can be for more than just a wall hanging\u2014and makes a polite request while it\u2019s at it. Better for intermediate stitchers than for beginners.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Intermediate cross-stitchers and up.\n\nWhat\u2019s included: Each kit offers a 20-inch pillow cover to stitch on, a plastic embroidery hoop, two embroidery needles, full skeins of all floss needed, a color pattern, and an instruction booklet.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: For a stitcher who has a few projects under their belt and is ready for something that won\u2019t live in a hoop forever, this is a satisfying and slightly more challenging project.\n\nSubversive Cross Stitch, which makes the kit, is one of the more established modern cross-stitch companies, offering hundreds of PDF patterns as well as other kits. The designs tend toward the snarky and oftentimes sweary, so if you\u2019ve been looking forward to stabbing something over and over to express a strongly held feeling, this is the online shop for you.\n\nThis pillowcase kit comes with clear, conversational, and funny instructions (including a reassurance that \u201conly a picky mother-in-law might point it out\u201d if the pattern is slightly off-center). This is a larger project that needs strict attention to detail, but you\u2019ll find plenty of supporting material to help.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThe cross-stitch pattern is printed across four pages, with instructions for how to cut it and tape it together with overlapping rows. It would be great if the pattern were all on one sheet.\n\nTwo slight edits to the pattern itself would help with accessibility: The pattern uses four colors of floss, but in the printout, two of the colors look similar. Changing one color in the printout to boost contrast or using a different symbol for each of the four colors (as many patterns do) would eliminate the problem.\n\nA cute and cuddly \u201ctrophy\u201d: Sincerely Louise Giant Moose Head\n\nTop pick\n\nWith this kit, you can knit a big moose head to hang on your wall, where it will undoubtedly attract compliments for the rest of time. It\u2019s charming and easy to assemble, though it involves a lot of steps.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Intermediate knitters.\n\nWhat\u2019s included: The kit contains all the yarn necessary to complete the project, a color instruction booklet, knitting needles, safety eyes, florist\u2019s wire, a darning needle, toy stuffing, a mounting board, and a drawstring bag to hold your work in progress.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: This clever take on taxidermy is from the UK-based Sincerely Louise, who specializes in whimsy.\n\nEvery item that makes up this kit seems thoughtfully chosen and high-quality, from the drawstring kit bag printed with a moose head to the professionally designed instruction booklet to the superior alpaca-blend yarn that you use to make the moose itself.\n\nThe instructions are specific and clear, and they include photos throughout to clarify the steps. The seller is well reviewed on Etsy and accessible via social media, and she even features a \u201cMaker of the Week\u201d on her Instagram feed. The moose head project has a lot of steps, but it\u2019s a pleasure to put together, thanks to the clear pattern.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThis shop is based in the UK, so shipping takes a little longer than usual for US-based buyers.\n\nA not-so-basic basic knitted sweater: Wool and the Gang Summer Feelin\u2019\n\nTop pick\n\nThis knitting project is easy to work on while you binge-watch TV, and the updated take on a classic design will have you reaching for the sweater when it\u2019s done.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Beginning knitters and up.\n\nWhat\u2019s included: The complete kit includes the yarn for the project (a recycled denim and cotton blend), knitting needles, a printed instruction booklet, and a sewing needle for weaving in ends.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: Knitting a sweater is a commitment, so the process should be a happy one. Wool and the Gang offers a variety of sweater patterns with picks for every taste.\n\nI chose the Summer Feelin\u2019, a crewneck sweater with an interesting split-open back for interest. It\u2019s made with the company\u2019s Billie Jean yarn, a mix of cotton and recycled consumer denim that I can\u2019t stop touching and can imagine would get even softer as the garment is finished and worn in.\n\nThis project involves miles of basic stockinette stitch, so it\u2019s a fantastic way for me to keep my hands busy while I\u2019m commuting or watching TV. It\u2019s a lengthy process, but the steps are simple, and the included instructions are clear.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nWool and the Gang\u2019s kits come packaged in paper bags, which do the trick, but we\u2019d prefer to see sweater kits and other larger projects packaged in a tote or a similar lightweight bag for easier portability.\n\nA cross-stitch coloring book: Lisa Congdon Brightside\n\nTop pick\n\nThis kit\u2019s cohesive color palette and simple shapes make for a soothing, simple project that looks great as decor. But the instructions could be a bit more detailed.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Beginner cross-stitchers and up.\n\nWhat\u2019s included: The kit includes white 14-count Aida cross-stitch fabric, a wooden embroidery hoop, a needle, full skeins of the required embroidery floss, and a color cross-stitch chart.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: At the risk of sounding like Sam I Am, I have worked on this piece in the passenger seat of the car, on my couch, at my desk while on a conference call, on a plane, in a caf\u00e9 waiting for coffee, and even once in a movie theater with a strategically placed shaft of light shining through the door. I would also like it in a box, and I\u2019m willing to bet I\u2019d like it with a fox, as well.\n\nThe pattern is based on Lisa Congdon\u2019s artwork, and the geometric, gridded design made this project absolutely addictive to me. The experience was like working on 24 very small, very simple projects that just so happened to be on one piece of fabric.\n\nCross-stitch consists of a series of Xs\u2014that is, each square requires two stitches. My favorite approach to this project was to work the outlines of each shape with a single stitch to begin and then fill in the inside and the other half of those first stitches later so that I didn\u2019t need to look at the pattern all the time. This project is the ultimate in cross-stitch\u2013as\u2013coloring book, and it\u2019s small and simple enough that I could throw the plastic bag it lived in into whatever bag I was using and take it on the go.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThough the pattern is basic, you won\u2019t find much hand-holding here. Beyond the graph-papered color chart of the pattern, the instructions are limited to five bullet-point tips, including one about how to find the center of the fabric to begin the pattern.\n\nThis pattern may not be the best choice for an absolute beginner, but if you want it to be your first project, do a little research into basic cross-stitch techniques first.\n\nFor the snacky stitcher: The Stranded Stitch Bread Head\n\nTop pick\n\nWe loved this cute, carby beginner cross-stitch project down to the last crumb.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Ambitious beginner cross-stitchers.\n\nWhat\u2019s included: The kit comes with a wooden embroidery hoop, all required colors of embroidery floss on a labeled thread card, a needle, 14-count Aida cross-stitch fabric, a cross-stitch basics intro sheet, and a color printed pattern.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: Who wouldn\u2019t love a noble bread basket rendered in fiber form? Nobody I want to know.\n\nThis beginner-friendly cross-stitch pattern is well presented, with a numbered thread card of pre-snipped threads to cut down on waste. You\u2019ll still have plenty of thread left over, but there\u2019s only so much beige and brown embroidery floss a person needs to have on hand.\n\nThis kit would make a great gift for a variety of people in its raw or finished-product form. It\u2019s undeniably cute\u2014and as a bonus, it\u2019ll probably make you want some breakfast.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThis kit has no particular flaws; we didn\u2019t find it lacking in instructions, materials, or presentation. The stitching experience is as satisfying as biting into a fresh croissant.\n\nA gateway to crochet: The Neon Tea Party Crochet Scrunchie\n\nTop pick\n\nThis bundle of supplies and a pattern for a simple, quick crochet-cloaked scrunchie should get you (pardon the pun) hooked in no time. Its instructions are downloadable, not printed.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Beginner crocheters.\n\nWhat\u2019s included: Each kit provides three or four skeins (depending on your colorway choice) of acrylic yarn, a digital crochet pattern, a crochet hook, an info card with a QR code for tutorials, five hair ties, a yarn needle, and a reusable zipper pouch for supplies.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: A lot of the joy of crafting is in the making, but there\u2019s also the rush that comes with holding a finished project in your hands. The Neon Tea Party\u2019s crochet scrunchie kit, a collaboration with designer Stitch\u2019d by India, gives you that rush\u2014fast. The project is extremely simple and can be completed in less than an hour.\n\nYou can easily knock out several scrunchies in a row and then jump into a much larger project\u2014this kit comes with enough yarn to really get you going, and the QR code leads to a series of detailed tutorials on The Neon Tea Party\u2019s website, which have become my favorite quick reference for all things crochet.\n\nBefore you know it, you\u2019ll have made scrunchies to give to everyone you know and moved on to granny squares. As a bonus, the kit comes in a well-made reusable zippered pouch with hot-pink piping\u2014a great project bag.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nThe pattern for this kit is a digital download, which you receive at purchase, but we\u2019d love to see a physical copy included with the materials.\n\nAdditionally, including some of the crochet info in booklet form would make this offering more of a true starter kit.\n\nA pocket-sized project: Marvling Bros Kawaii Kross Stitch Kit in a Matchbox\n\nTop pick\n\nThese itty-bitty cross-stitch projects are as giftable as they are cute, which is to say, extremely so. But the small print of the pattern can be hard to see for people with low vision.\n\nWho it\u2019s for: Intermediate cross-stitchers.\n\nWhat\u2019s included: Each matchbox kit includes cross-stitch fabric, an embroidery needle, all the necessary embroidery floss, and a color pattern sheet.\n\nWhy it\u2019s great: Tiny stuff is cute, and the tinier, the cuter. Therefore, these cross-stitch kits housed in matchbox-sized containers are the cutest.\n\nThe kits come in an array of kawaii designs, including a smiling hot dog (he loves having mustard on him), a happy mushroom, a grinning rainbow, a teensy taco, and more. They\u2019re fantastic to have on hand for stocking stuffers or just-because gifts. And as personal projects, they\u2019re quick little dopamine hits.\n\nFlaws but not dealbreakers\n\nA side effect of a tiny project that comes in a tiny box is that it\u2019s, well, tiny. This piece is too small to fit in an embroidery frame, so the stitcher has to keep an eye on tension. That\u2019s not so hard, since the fabric is quite stiff, but it\u2019s worth keeping in mind.\n\nThis kit isn\u2019t a great choice for someone with low vision, due to the very small print of the pattern, or for anyone with physical limitations, such as hands that cramp easily.\n\nWhat to look forward to\n\nThis fall, we\u2019re testing new kits from a variety of brands, including knitting kits from The Spinning Hand and Purl Soho, a mending kit from Ministry of Mending, needlepoint kits from Craft Club and Hello Bargello, and a variety of kits from Wool and the Gang. We\u2019ll update this guide with our findings soon.\n\nSupplemental items worth considering\n\nIf you want to invest a little more into your hobbies, the following accessories can make crafting a bit easier, though they\u2019re not essential.\n\nThread snips: For all the crafts on this list, a pair of small thread snips would be a lightweight addition to your craft bag. No more hunting down and then maneuvering your full-size household scissors.\n\nNeck light: If you work in dimmer environments, a small rechargeable neck light can help with visibility.\n\nProject bag: You should have a clean container to store your works in progress to protect them from the elements and hazards like grubby hands, whether it\u2019s a clean tote bag or even a gallon-size resealable bag.\n\nThread conditioner: For cross-stitch and embroidery, sliding your floss through thread conditioner like this one can help reduce frustrating tangles.\n\nPVC Q-Snap frames: I personally find this style of embroidery frame easier to hold than hoop-style frames, and they keep fabric tighter, too.\n\nStitch almanac: A reference book like this one is not only useful for figuring out how to achieve certain embroidery effects but can also serve as inspiration if you\u2019re ready to branch out to your own designs.\n\nRow counter: For knitting and crochet, you can use a pen and scrap paper to keep track of what row or round you\u2019re on, but a dedicated row counter is helpful, and an inexpensive tally counter works just as well as something knitting-specific.\n\nThe competition\n\nWe assembled this guide as a starting point for finding reliable in-stock suppliers for kits\u2014I tested a variety of designs and items from the above companies, but I encourage you to look around for a project that feels suited to you or your gift recipient\u2019s taste and ability. It\u2019s a big, crafty world out there, just waiting for you to stitch it up.\n\nOf course, testing every craft kit available was an impossible task, so I focused on testing options that I had seen repeatedly. The following are a few kits that I thought fell short in comparison with our picks.\n\nBoth a crochet kit and a knit kit that I tested from We Are Knitters fell short of my expectations design-wise, and both had errors in their written patterns that would trip up the beginner crafters they were meant for.\n\nThe \u201cslow stitching\u201d kits from Wattle&Loop have chased me across the algorithm for months. They look gorgeous, but they are more expensive than other kits, and they leave the crafter to figure out how to do certain essential steps, such as transferring the pattern onto the fabric. A crafter at the skill level required to complete the kit would be likely to assemble their own supplies instead.\n\nKnit Picks has great online tutorials and affordable knitting supplies, but its all-in-one kit options are limited, and its customer service was not responsive to my queries.\n\nMany options across Etsy and similar sites were appealing, and I encourage you to patronize small businesses and independent artists. That said, we decided to exclude many of these from our testing out of concerns regarding their availability.\n\nHow we picked and tested\n\nI\u2019m a crafting enthusiast, so I polled my broad network of Instagram friends, crafty pals, and the staff at local yarn and craft stores for their thoughts. I browsed many websites to make sure that kits were well reviewed and regularly in stock, dove deep into my targeted ads, and consulted lists of other craft kits and gift guides.\n\nAs for testing, there\u2019s no substitute for completing the kits: Over several months I spent more than 100 hours knitting, crocheting, embroidering, and cross-stitching my way through the test patterns. I took note of pattern issues and speed bumps, and of projects that I couldn\u2019t wait to jump back into.\n\nThis article was edited by Ben Keough and Erica Ogg.\n\nMeet your guide\n\nKase Wickman\n\nWhat I Cover\n\nKase Wickman is a freelance journalist and hobby enthusiast. She has never met a craft she didn\u2019t want to try, and she especially loves sewing. She is the author of Bring It On: The Complete Story of the Cheerleading Movie That Changed, Like, Everything (No, Seriously), and her work has appeared in The New York Times, Vanity Fair, Cosmopolitan, and more.\n\nFurther reading\n\nThe Best Kids Craft Subscription Boxes\n\nby Ambreia Meadows-Fernandez\n\nCraft subscription boxes are a fun, educational way to keep kids entertained.

You don\u2019t need to run your plans past anyone, not even your professional superiors. If it feels right then do it!\n\nDon\u2019t worry if you find yourself loaded up with new responsibilities because you have what it takes to make a success of them. You may have a reputation as one of the more laidback members of the zodiac but you also possess skills that other people lack.\n\nWith Mars, your ruling planet, moving through the most secretive area of your chart you must keep what you know about a certain situation to yourself. If you give away too much information now it could cause a great deal of panic later on.\n\nMars in your opposite sign of Scorpio means you must expect some resistance from those you deal with on a one-to-one basis. Be that as it may this is not the time to have second thoughts about what you know must be done. Do it immediately!\n\nCosmic activity in the work and wellbeing area of your chart will give you the energy to push ahead with plans that are sure to provoke resistance from people who don\u2019t see the need for change. Think before you act but then act swiftly and decisively.\n\nThis is one of the best times of the year to get serious about creative projects of one kind or another. Set yourself targets that stretch you but are still within reach and then go after them with passion and purpose. You might just change the world.\n\nYou have spent too much time sitting around watching the world go by \u2013 now you must get up and get out there and start making things happen. Travel plans you make now will pay off in a big way later on, and you\u2019ll have fun as well.\n\nYou may not be one of the more sociable members of the zodiac but you have your moments and with Mars moving through the most outgoing area of your chart you will find it easier than usual to indulge in small talk \u2013 which could lead to big opportunities.\n\nYou need to find an outlet for all that pent-up energy and one way might be to focus on ways to make money. Even if you are well-off already, having a dollar figure to aim for will encourage you to aim higher and accomplish more creatively.\n\nYou will find it extraordinarily easy to get things done now that Mars is moving through your sign, but you must be selective about your goals. Also, don\u2019t let other people distract you from what is of most importance to you personally.\n\nThe best way to change the world for the better is to change the way you choose to live. Forget about what the headlines say and focus only on what is going on in your own life and the lives of those you are directly connected to.\n\nSometimes you fail to take radical action because you worry what other people might think about it, but now you must put those fears out of your mind and do what you know in your heart to be right. Listen to your conscience and ignore everything else."

Notable recommendations for new car seats include the Graco SnugRide SnugFit 35 DLX infant seat and the Graco Extend2Fit Convertible Car Seat, both praised for their ease of installation and value.",

                "text": "From September 21 until October 4, bring an old car seat or car-seat base (even if it\u2019s damaged or past the expiration date) to any Target store and place it in the designated drop-off box near the Guest Services counter. Then, use the Target app to scan the code on the box, which will generate a coupon for 20% off any new kid car seat or car-seat base, including items that are on sale. The 20% off reward can be redeemed twice, and can be combined with other offers and discounts.\n\nThough old car seats will only be accepted through October 4, the coupon can be used in-store or online on two separate purchases through October 18. The coupon isn\u2019t limited to just car seats, either; other kid essentials like strollers and high chairs are also eligible for the 20% off. And if you have a Target RedCard, the store\u2019s credit card, you can save an additional 5% by using it to purchase your new baby gear.\n\nAccording to Target, all of the used car seats collected during the event will be broken down and recycled through Target\u2019s recycling partners to be remade into things like plastic buckets, pallets, construction materials, select Target-brand Brightroom items, and more.\n\nA big reason we recommend taking advantage of Target\u2019s car seat trade-in event is that you can get our favorite infant, convertible, and booster picks at a guaranteed discount with the 20% coupon.\n\nStill, Ingela Ratledge Amundson, one of the editors of our guide to infant carseats, points out that, even at their regular retail prices, these Graco seats are an excellent value. In particular, the Graco SnugRide SnugFit 35 DLX infant seat and the Graco Extend2Fit Convertible Car Seat offer outstanding bang for their buck. \u201cIn our testing, we were particularly impressed by how easy these seats were to install and how many thoughtful, premium-feeling features they offered. They out-performed a lot of other seats that were far pricier,\u201d Ingela said.\n\nWe first chose the Graco SnugRide SnugFit 35 DLX as our infant car-seat top pick in May 2022 after our testing determined that it \u201cprovides the total package of user-friendliness, quality, and value.\u201d It\u2019s easy to install and comes with \u201csome bells and whistles usually reserved for pricier models, such as a removable seat pad for quicker cleanup, harness straps that you don\u2019t have to undo and rethread to adjust, and one-handed handle adjustment.\u201d While all car seats, no matter the price, must meet the same federal safety standards, the Graco SnugRide SnugFit 35 DLX has the added safety feature of an anti-rebound base, which \u201ccan help limit the amount the seat rotates (or rebounds) after the initial impact of a crash.\u201d\n\nThis seat does a superior job of keeping a child rear-facing for longer\u2014and it\u2019s straightforward to install and use.\n\nIf your child has outgrown an infant car seat we recommend our top-pick convertible seat, the Graco Extend2Fit Convertible Car Seat. During testing, the Extend2Fit stood out from the pack for its \u201cpretty easy installation and thoughtful features.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re bullish on starting with an infant car seat before moving on to a convertible seat, and we note in our convertible car-seat guide that \u201cwe\u2019ve found that each individual type of seat tends to do a far better job of its dedicated purpose than an all-in-one seat can.\u201d But if you're set on a seat that\u2019s a one-and-done purchase, the Graco Extend2Fit 3-in-1, which \u201ccan be used as a rear-facing infant seat, a rear-facing toddler seat, a forward-facing toddler seat, a big-kid seat, and finally a booster seat may be worth considering.\n\nThis attractive booster is safe, easy to use, and comfortable. It\u2019s a hit with caregivers and kids alike.\n\nFor bigger kids who are ready to ride in a booster seat, the Chicco KidFit ClearTex Plus is the top pick in our booster-seat guide; it converts from a high-back seat to a backless one, comes with two cup holders, and was deemed cushy and comfortable by our kid testers.\n\nThis article was edited by Annemarie Conte and Ingela Ratledge Amundson."

                "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Not everyone can be Marco Rubio.\n\nSen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) is rolling out a new bill to crack down on government employees who are working more than one civil service job simultaneously, unless they have permission to do so.\n\nWhile existing law prohibits full-time government workers from obtaining more than one federal position concurrently without permission, the Hawkeye State Republican is hoping to tighten those rules via the Dismantling Double Dippers Act, which would require annual audits of payroll records.\n\nIn tandem with the new bill, Ernst, who chairs the Senate DOGE Caucus, urged the Office of Personnel Management to study the extent to which government employees are double-dipping.\n\n\u201cThe public, who is paying the salaries of federal employees and contractors, deserves access to this information and the federal government,\u201d she wrote in a letter to OPM Director Scott Kupor obtained by The Post.\n\n\u201cBecause OPM oversees policies related to hiring and managing the federal workforce, your agency is best situated to provide the leadership necessary to increase transparency and stop the timecard fraud by double-billing bureaucrats.\u201d\n\nDespite the existing rules against civil servants having more than one government job, there have been multiple known instances of workers managing to hold several federal positions at the same time.\n\nFor instance, between 2021 and 2024, a Department of Housing and Urban Development worker had several full-time contractor gigs with the federal government and, at times, even billed Uncle Sam for more than 24 hours of work in a day.\n\nThat worker, Crissy Monique Baker, pleaded guilty in July to making fraudulent claims about the work hours she put in, costing taxpayers an estimated $225,866 in losses.\n\nShe worked at HUD, AmeriCorps, and the National Institutes of Health, and at one point claimed to have done 26 hours\u2019 worth of work on 13 days in a single month.\n\nAnother case cited by Ernst entailed an NSA contractor who had filed another Department of War contract at the same time and pled guilty in 2014, bilked taxpayers $65,265, and submitted 79 fraudulent timesheets.\n\nThe GOP senator also pointed to a case that didn\u2019t involve actual double-dipping but is thematically relevant. It involved a top policy adviser at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), who claimed to have been moonlighting in another role at the CIA.\n\nJohn Beale, who was sentenced to 32 months in jail back in 2014, managed to keep the scheme going for 13 years and ripped off taxpayers to the tune of $900,000, according to prosecutors.\n\nWhile claiming to be carrying out critical missions for the CIA, he would actually go on jaunts overseas or relax at his vacation home in Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a case of moonlighting per se, but the EPA should have known such an arrangement was illegal and better monitored the whereabouts and productivity of one of its senior staff members,\u201d the senator argued.\n\nTo better enforce the existing law, the Dismantling Double Dippers Act would require OPM\u2019s official watchdog to conduct an annual audit cross-checking government payrolls.\n\nThe senator also asked OPM to make information about government job titles and descriptions available to the public."

This service provides a flexible alternative to traditional flight booking, catering especially to families or budget-conscious travelers.",

                "text": "There are few things more stressful than booking a flight. One minute you find a fare that feels doable, the next it\u2019s hundreds of dollars higher, and suddenly you\u2019re stuck deciding between draining your savings, putting it on a credit card, or just\u2026not going.\n\nThat\u2019s where Paylater Travel comes in. The booking platform, founded in Australia and now operating in the US, UK, and Canada, lets you freeze any airfare with a deposit (sometimes as low as 10%) and pay off the rest in installments before departure. The best part? There\u2019s no interest, no late fees, and no credit checks involved.\n\nIt\u2019s essentially layaway for flights \u2014 a concept that feels almost retro, but with a modern twist. Instead of banks profiting off our desperation to travel (hello, overdraft fees and sky-high interest rates), this setup makes booking a trip a little less financially terrifying.\n\nPaylater Travel\n\nPaylater Travel has already helped over 150,000 people take trips they might have otherwise missed, and it boasts a 4.7-star Trustpilot rating to prove it.\n\n\u201cI paid $1,526 for three tickets from Philadelphia to Anchorage [Alaska] over the last 10 weeks with no hidden fees. Those same tickets today would have cost me over $2,400. I highly recommend this service and will definitely be using them again,\u201d said one reviewer from TrustPilot.\n\n\u201cI loved this service. I was able to pay additionally when I wanted and was still able to keep the weekly payments, which made booking these tickets a breeze,\u201d shared another customer.\n\n\u201cI used [Paylater Travel] to book flights for my family and [me] to Bali, something we never would\u2019ve been able to afford if it wasn\u2019t for the service these guys provide. Then our circumstances changed, and unfortunately, my husband was no longer able to travel with us,\u201d said another reviewer from TrustPilot. I contacted PLT and spoke with [a customer service agent] who was able to organise a refund for just my husband\u2019s tickets easily. She was a delight and made the whole process so simple. I will use Paylater Travel for all my family holiday flights; they are amazing.\u201d\n\nHow it works\n\nSearch flights: Browse millions of routes and airlines just like you normally would.\n\nChoose a deposit: Reserve your seat with as little as 10% of the total fare.\n\nPay in installments: Spread the remaining cost over weekly or bi-weekly payments \u2014 up to 26 installments.\n\nLock in your fare: Your ticket price won\u2019t change while you\u2019re paying it off, even if fares rise for everyone else.\n\nGet your ticket: Once your balance is fully paid, your e-ticket arrives in your inbox.\n\nNo interest. No hidden fees. No impact on your credit score. Just a simple way to book flights without paying the full amount upfront.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of ways to book travel these days, and Paylater Travel won\u2019t be for everyone \u2014 especially if you\u2019d rather rack up credit card points or prefer to pay in full upfront. But for families or travelers who find airfare to be one of the biggest budget hurdles for traveling, the flexibility could be a game-changer.\n\nAt the very least, it\u2019s proof that the travel industry is finally starting to catch up to the way many of us actually budget for trips: one paycheck at a time.\n\nWhy Trust Post Wanted by the New York Post"

Now, more patients are choosing to stay alert during the procedure, watching their curves get crafted in real time.\n\nTo learn more about the trending \u201cawake BBL,\u201d The Post spoke with board-certified plastic surgeon Dr. Sean McNally about the upsides \u2014 and downsides \u2014 of staying conscious while doctors boost your backside.\n\nWhat is an awake BBL?\n\nIt involves removing fat from areas like the abdomen, thighs or back through liposuction and injecting it into the buttocks to create a fuller, curvier appearance.\n\nTraditionally, the procedure is performed in an operating room with the patient under general anesthesia.\n\nBut during an awake BBL, patients remain fully conscious. The surgery is typically done in an office setting using local anesthesia and oral sedatives.\n\nWhat are the perks of an awake BBL?\n\nPatients are usually drawn to an awake BBL for two main reasons, said McNally, who serves as the lead provider at Doctor PDX and R\u00e9viance in Portland, Ore.\n\n\u201cOne, there\u2019s no anesthesia provider and either a reduced or no facility fee, which makes the procedure more affordable,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cTwo, patients are concerned about the safety profile of standard BBLs, and they feel like being awake makes it safer.\u201d\n\nSome clinics also promote faster recovery times, avoiding the nausea and grogginess sometimes linked to general anesthesia and allowing patients to return to daily activities sooner.\n\nWhy do some surgeons not perform awake BBLs?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t perform them, and I know many others who don\u2019t,\u201d McNally said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s a bad surgery per se \u2014 the big issue is patient comfort versus results.\u201d\n\nBecause doctors can only use a limited amount of local anesthetic based on a patient\u2019s weight and height, there\u2019s only so much pain relief they can provide.\n\n\u201cI have heard absolute horror stories from patients who went to chop shops for cheap liposuction, and once the surgeon hit the max local anesthetic volume they could give them, they were told to hold still and bare it if they wanted a good result, while the patient could feel everything,\u201d McNally said.\n\nSome surgeons have pushed past safe limits, risking potentially deadly lidocaine toxicity by giving patients too much local anesthesia to ease their pain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of any of these options,\u201d McNally said.\n\nThere\u2019s also a legal catch: Many states cap how much fat can be removed during liposuction in an office setting, leaving less to work with \u2014 and potentially disappointing outcomes.\n\n\u201cYou never want to have to balance patient comfort during a case against whether you\u2019re getting the result you and the patient want.\u201d McNally said.\n\nWhat are the other risks of an awake BBL?\n\nBesides pain, McNally said the safety profile of an awake BBL are generally similar to the traditional procedure.\n\n\u201cMore common risks include swelling, bruising, bleeding, infection, contour irregularities where we do the liposuction to collect the fat, variable take of the transplanted fat and hard lumps of fat that didn\u2019t take, known as fat necrosis,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe \u201cmost dreaded\u201d complication is fat embolism \u2014 a rare but life-threatening condition that strikes when fat enters the bloodstream and travels to the heart or lungs. This can occur whether the patient is awake or under general anesthesia.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bWe help mitigate this risk by being mindful of our injection volumes, and we complete the injection under ultrasound guidance to avoid injecting fat into the muscles where the largest vessels are,\u201d McNally said.\n\nAdvice for anyone considering an awake BBL\n\n\u201cAs always, seek a knowledgeable and reputable provider based on the experience \u2014 not by price point,\u201d McNally said.\n\nBefore getting the procedure, he recommends having a frank and honest conversation with your doctor about your goals and concerns.\n\n\u201cThe right provider will help guide you to the option that\u2019s right for you and if you don\u2019t think that surgeon is a good fit for you, find a surgeon who is,\u201d McNally said."

The minister said the lab didn\u2019t have security cameras.\n\nFour suspects have been arrested, including a restoration specialist at the museum who confessed to giving the bracelet to an acquaintance who owns a silver shop in Cairo\u2019s Sayyeda Zainab district.\n\nIt was allegedly later sold to the owner of a gold workshop for the equivalent of about $3,800.\n\nIt was eventually sold for around $4,000 to a worker at another gold workshop, who melted the bracelet down to make other gold jewelry.\n\nThe suspects confessed to their crimes, and the money was seized, the ministry said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe ministry also released security camera video showing a shop owner receiving a bracelet, weighing it, and then paying one of the suspects.\n\nLocal media reported Sunday that a judge ordered the restoration specialist and her acquaintance to remain in detention for 15 more days pending further investigations.\n\nHe ordered the release of the two remaining suspects if they posted bail set at 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($207) each.\n\nThe loss of a treasure that had survived for three millennia was painful to many people in Egypt, where there is great esteem for the nation\u2019s ancient heritage.\n\nSome questioned security measures at the museum and called for tightening these measures around the country\u2019s treasures.\n\nMonica Hanna, a prominent Egyptian archaeologist, called for suspending oversees exhibits \u201cuntil better control\u201d is implemented to secure the artifacts. Hanna is the dean at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport, and campaigns for the return of Egyptian artifacts exhibited in museums overseas.\n\nMalek Adly, an Egyptian human rights lawyer, called the theft \u201can alarm bell\u201d for the government and said better security is needed for antiquities in exhibition halls and those in storage.\n\nAmenemope ruled Egypt from Tanis in the Nile Delta during Egypt\u2019s 21st Dynasty. The Tanis royal necropolis was discovered by the French archaeologist Pierre Montet in 1940, according to the Egyptian Museum.\n\nThe necropolis\u2019s collection exhibits about 2,500 ancient artifacts, including golden funerary masks, silver coffins, and golden jewels.\n\nThe collection was restored in 2021 in cooperation with the Louvre Museum in Paris.\n\nThe theft reminded some of past cultural losses, including the disappearance of Vincent van Gogh\u2019s \u201cPoppy Flowers\u201d \u2014 then valued at $50 million \u2014 from another Cairo museum in 2010.\n\nThe painting was first stolen in 1977 but was later recovered. However, since its theft in 2010 it has not been found."

The details of the settlement have not been disclosed.\n\nHis sister, Ann Passer, was accused by the trustee of raking in $4.7 million. She also agreed to an undisclosed settlement in June last year.\n\nPicard and his law firm were tasked in 2008 with recovering any gains from Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme, an investment scam that pays early investors with money from later investors rather than from any actual profits.\n\nHe claims on his website that he has raked in nearly $15 billion as of last month from his estimated principal loss of $18 billion.\n\nSet up in 1960, Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities became one of Wall Street\u2019s largest market-makers, a company that matches buyers and sellers of stocks.\n\nOver the years, the firm was investigated eight times by the SEC because it made exceptional returns.\n\nBut the 2008 global financial crisis prompted the firm\u2019s demise as Madoff investors, hit by the downturn, tried to withdraw some $7 billion, and he could not find the money to cover it.\n\nThe list of those scammed included actor Kevin Bacon, Hall of Fame baseball player Sandy Koufax, the Wilpon family that formerly owned the New York Mets and film director Steven Spielberg\u2019s charitable foundation, Wunderkinder.\n\nA string of banks also lost money, with HSBC Holdings saying it had around $1 billion in exposure and Japan\u2019s Nomura reporting losses of $358 million."

                "text": "If an exalted girlboss, who is best friends with Meghan Markle and Lauren Sanchez, admits dropping racial and gay slurs in years past, does it make a sound?\n\nIt would seem not.\n\nAnd the silence from the social justice warriors, cancelers and even fellow media is as deafening as it is hypocritical.\n\nOn Friday night, an investigation into the behavior of billionaire Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd \u2014 who began her career at Tinder before suing the dating app and it\u2019s parent company in 2014 for sexual harassment \u2014 was published by the Daily Mail. The parties settled out of court.\n\nFormer Tinder colleagues said Wolfe Herd overstated her influence and role at the tech company, was violent toward her ex-boyfriend Tinder co-founder Justin Mateen and treated fellow female employees terribly. (She denied the allegations).\n\nAnd in the piece, she admitted to using the N-word and other slurs, but \u2014 forgive her lord \u2014 she blamed it on her colleagues, saying she was simply keeping up with the fellas in the male-centric tech company.\n\nThe story paints a murkier picture of the founder\u2019s fairytale of female empowerment, which was made into a fawning film, \u201cSwiped\u201d and debuted on Hulu last week.\n\nWolfe Herd, who said she had nothing to do with the film, is played by Lily James.\n\nBut surely, her friend\u2019s admission would spur Markle, who built her entire identity on fighting against racism, to speak out against such dangerous language? The Robert F. Kennedy Foundation even gave her and her husband Prince Harry the Ripple of Hope award for championing racial justice.\n\nAfter all, Markle ran to Oprah in 2021 to cry about the racism she allegedly endured at the hands of the royal family. She accused an unnamed member of having \u201cconcerns and conversations about how dark [Archie\u2019s] skin might be\u201d\n\nShe and Prince Harry said racism \u201cwas a large part\u201d of their reason to flee the UK and he blathered on about \u201cunconscious bias.\u201d\n\nBut why the crickets from Markle? And the rest of the \u2018be kind\u2019 brigade out in Hollywood?\n\nBack in April, she only had effusive praise for her pal, who was the inaugural guest on her podcast \u201cConfessions of a Female Founder.\u201d The two fawned over each other and Markle described her as, \u201cthe kind of friend who just always seems to know the exact right thing to say when I need perspective.\u201d\n\nOn that episode, Wolfe Herd said she was initially driven to create a female forward platform, which would eventually become Bumble, to \u201cencourage kindness among women.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all so phony.\n\nFor over a decade, we\u2019ve been living through a witch hunt where media and internet executioners have acted like raccoons, scraping through people\u2019s garbage, looking for any offensive posts or actions.\n\nAnd lots of folks were axed because of such words. In 2013, Paula Dean was dropped from the Food Network for admitting she used the N-word years prior.\n\nMeanwhile, Chris Harrison left the Bachelor after 20 years because he was blasted for defending contestant Rachael Kirkconnell, who had attended an Antebellum themed college party in 2018.\n\nMegyn Kelly was exiled from NBC and forced to apologize for asking when wearing blackface on Halloween became so taboo. Never mind that Jimmy Fallon, Jane Krakowski and John Hamm had actually done blackface on network shows. Jimmy Kimmel also did blackface while playing Karl Malone.\n\nShane Gillis was fired by Saturday Night Live in 2019 after a \u201cjournalist\u201d revealed that he used Asian slurs in a podcast.\n\nIn late 2020, the New York Times wrote about a random teenager girl in Virginia who used the N-word in a video as a 15-year-old and it came back to haunt her years later, as she was forced to withdraw from her college.\n\nBut racial slurs and offensive words, which were once a five alarm fire, that landed celebrities and nobodies into a pit of shame, are no longer worth mentioning.\n\nAfter all, Markle transitioned from fighting racism to a more important callings: spreading joy, making jam and being a support beam of the female empowerment complex, while making lots of cash.\n\nAnd because calling Wolfe Herd out would only upset her Montecito ecosystem. Unlike attacking the royals, which led to a rollout of lucrative opportunities in podcasting and streaming.\n\nOn one hand, I\u2019m heartened that our culture is seemingly no longer interested in the re-litigation of past indiscretions or errors in judgement with the penalty of social execution.\n\nI\u2019d like to think we\u2019ve decided to grant people the grace to make mistakes and be human.\n\nHowever, I know that\u2019s not the full story.\n\nWolfe Herd is protected because she is in the club of anointed good people. Such mercy won\u2019t be extended to non-members."

                "text": "Yes to dinner; no to aiding and abetting.\n\nTori Spelling once went on a pleasant group date with notorious Hollywood bad boy Charlie Sheen, but that didn\u2019t mean she was willing to hide him from the authorities.\n\nThe daughter of late legendary TV and movie producer Aaron Spelling took to her \u201cmisSPELLING\u201d podcast Monday to explain how the Sheen date came to be.\n\nIn the mid-\u201990s, Tori was living with her friend Kevin, who later became her dentist, in a Los Angeles condo a few floors above Sheen\u2019s. According to the actress, Kevin was not sober at the time, and he and Sheen \u201cpartied together.\u201d\n\n\u201cKevin said, \u2018Charlie wants to ask you on a date,'\u201d Tori, 52, told guest Amy Sugarman, admitting that she was nervous\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to go alone.\u201d\n\nKevin told the \u201cBeverly Hills, 90210\u201d star that his parents, whom Tori and Sheen both knew, would be joining.\n\nThe foursome went to an Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills.\n\n\u201cWe were just getting to know each other,\u201d Tori recalled of her conversations with Sheen, 60, emphasizing that Kevin was \u201ctrying to set [them] up.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what I learned that night is how unimaginably intelligent [Sheen] is,\u201d she marveled. \u201cOff the charts. And his humor was just so \u2014 talk about charming, smart, funny, witty. Like, this guy was it.\u201d\n\nTori described the outing as a \u201cgood moment\u201d with the \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d star. However, she went on to detail a few \u201cbad moments.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get a call: \u2018Come downstairs. Charlie\u2019s having this party. You have to come here, please,'\u201d she recalled, adding that she and her friends agreed to go \u201cfor one second.\u201d\n\nWhen Sheen opened the door to his condo, he allegedly offered Tori a crack pipe.\n\n\u201cIt was dark, and there were bodies everywhere,\u201d she told Sugarman, confessing that she was scared.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018No, thanks.\u2019 And he was like, \u2018What would you like? We have every drug,'\u201d she claimed.\n\nLater that year, Tori explained that the US Marshals had a warrant out for Sheen\u2019s arrest after he allegedly attacked his girlfriend at the time, Brittany Ashland.\n\nTori didn\u2019t know any of those details, just that \u201cthey were actively searching for him. Like, helicopters.\u201d\n\nShe explained, \u201cAll I know is I was standing in my laundry room, and Kevin comes in and says, \u2018T, I need to ask you a favor.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Yeah, of course, anything.\u2019 And he\u2019s like, \u2018Can we hide Charlie?'\u201d\n\nAccording to Tori, Kevin insisted that \u201cno one [would] know\u201d because he would \u201csneak him into\u201d her laundry room via the service elevator in the back hallway.\n\nBut she instantly shut down the plan, responding, \u201cAre you f\u2013king kidding me? No! I\u2019m not doing that. \u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I think he\u2019s a really great guy.\u201d\n\nTori said Sheen was eventually arrested in the building (he was placed on probation after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge) and that Kevin tried to make her feel guilty for not assisting.\n\nThe actor recounted the same story in his new memoir, \u201cThe Book of Sheen,\u201d writing, \u201cTori felt bad for me but viewed my situation as radioactive and didn\u2019t wanna go anywhere near it. Couldn\u2019t blame her, I suppose. But f\u2013k, man. Who knows what story I\u2019d be banging out right now if the heir to Daddy\u2019s throne said \u2018yes.'\u201d\n\nSheen ended up violating his probation in 1998 after suffering a near-fatal cocaine overdose and was ordered to go to rehab."

According to a viral dermatologist, it\u2019s less about how much you spend on fancy products and more about what\u2019s inside the bottle.\n\n\u201cProve me wrong, but no skincare product can smooth bump skin, minimize pores, plump fine lines, and fade dark spots like a retinoid,\u201d Harvard-trained dermatologist and skin cancer surgeon Dr. Neera Nathan shared in a recent post that has accumulated over 550,000 views on TikTok.\n\nWhat is a retinoid, exactly? Retinoids are compounds derived from Vitamin A that are commonly used as skincare treatments.

                "text": "Like finding the perfect foundation or concealer, choosing the best shampoo for your hair type can easily turn into a wild goose chase.\n\nThe subject of in-shower hair care can be pretty divided. How often should I use shampoo each week? What about conditioner? What\u2019s the best shampoo for oily hair? Dandruff? Dry scalp? Thinning hair? Do I really have to rinse and repeat?\n\nThese questions are all valid, especially if your No. 1 goal is to achieve salon-worthy hair at home (with or without the TikTok-famous Dyson Airwrap, but that\u2019s an article for another day).\n\nThe Post Wanted team (naturally) loves to shop and provide credible recommendations on what\u2019s worth your money and what\u2019s not. This review of the best shampoos is one of our readers\u2019 favorites, which is why it has been a topic I\u2019ve put to the test for four years straight.\n\nThe full testing method is highlighted below, but allow me to give you the TLDR version. I put a variety of shampoos on a strict rotation, analyzed how they lathered and rinsed each hair-wash day, and assessed the final look once styled, while also considering the best conditioners to complete your routine.\n\nBecause shampoo is necessary to care for and cleanse your hair and scalp, Post Wanted consulted two hairstylists who provided the 411 on all things shampoo, from ingredients to look for to how to apply it to your scalp.\n\n\u201cIf you feel the shampoo is no longer working for your needs, it\u2019s time for a change to address the latest concern,\u201d Amy Abramite, hairstylist, salon educator and creative director at Maxine Ltd. in Chicago, told the Post. \u201cHaving a few different shampoos in the shower to rotate is an effective way to treat multiple concerns simultaneously.\u201d\n\nBut, scrubbing a sudsy formula on your strands is more trial-and-error than anything else, which is why I put 29+ sought-after shampoos to the test \u2014 including the best dry shampoos I tested and the best sulfate-free shampoos I reviewed, as well as the best personalized shampoos I reviewed after taking hair quizzes from three top brands.\n\nFor more hair advice, check out our expert-backed FAQ for the answers to your burning questions.\n\nBest Shampoo Overall: K\u00e9rastase Resistance Bain Extensioniste Shampoo\n\nPairs well with: K\u00e8rastase Resistance Fondant Extensioniste Conditioner ($48) and K\u00e8rastase Resistance Masque Extensioniste ($68)\n\nThe K\u00e9rastase Resistance Bain Extentioniste Shampoo is a true game-changer that made a difference in my hair after one use. Not only did my entire head of hair feel thicker but the ends of my hair felt longer and more nourished. Simply put, it\u2019s my go-to formulation whenever I have a special occasion or want my hair to really speed up in terms of growth.\n\nThe divine scent and effective absorbability make it a winner in my book. I rave about this shampoo, in particular, a ton \u2014 and it\u2019s one everyone *has* to try. Bonus points if you use the brand\u2019s Resistance Serum Extensioniste ($60) after shampooing and conditioning, to go along with it. Truly, it\u2019s the hair-strengthening trio of my dreams.\n\nSize: 8.5 fluid ounces | Scent: Fresh | Testing Notes: Safe for color-treated hair\n\nBest Personalized Shampoo: Prose\n\nAfter weeks of testing, Prose was my favorite of the three. Though I recommend and use all of them, something about this formula just worked for my hair.\n\nAfter taking a hair quiz (much like the two others), you\u2019ll have a fresh-scented formula show up at your door that you can\u2019t help but love. The difference between Prose and competing brands? It\u2019s a fully custom product line \u2014 backed by science \u2014 which is a stark contrast from others that have a pre-formulated base. From base to end product, you\u2019re receiving something custom to you.\n\nIt\u2019s a really cool process to design a shampoo that you want to use. From scent to even geographic location, Prose does the work and you\u2019ll find your hair starting to work in your favor when you use the product consistently.\n\nHowever, you\u2019ll only want to use Prose from the moment you receive your package. It\u2019ll allow you to truly understand if the product is working for you by sticking to only the brand for a few months. From there, I\u2019d recommend adding some other brands and products to the mix once you get a feel for how it\u2019s performing on your hair type.\n\nPairs well with: Prose Conditioner ($34)\n\nSize: 8.5 fluid ounces | Scent: Customizable | Testing Notes: Really worth the money if you want a shampoo curated to your specific hair type and needs\n\nBest Shampoo for Thinning Hair: Virtue Full Shampoo\n\nFirst things first \u2014 fine hair is when the stands are slender in diameter compared to coarse hair where the diameter is larger, according to Abramite.\n\n\u201cA densifying shampoo plumps the size of strands with hyaluronic acid, making hair feel thicker through hydration,\u201d she said. \u201cFor hair thinning from breakage due to heat styling or chemical over-processing, a repairing shampoo is best.\u201d\n\nAs for ingredients, Fitzsimons recommends \u201ccaffeine, green tea, pumpkin seed and rosemary oil,\u201d specifically. \u201cCaffeine promotes hair growth by stimulating hair follicles,\u201d he adds. \u201cGreen tea, pumpkin seed, and rosemary prevent hair loss by strengthening hair follicles.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s great about the Virtue Full Shampoo is its gentle yet effective cleanse. It strikes the perfect balance compared to plenty of other options on this list. Whenever I have an event or know I want my hair to look fuller, this formulation remains the trusty option I reach for.\n\nPairs well with: Virtue Full Conditioner ($44)\n\nSize: 8 fluid ounces | Scent: Fruity-floral | Testing Notes: Great for adding volume\n\nBest Shampoo for Body: Biosilk Silk Therapy Original Shampoo\n\nHoly hair. I\u2019ve been using Biosilk for years (seriously, since middle school) and the Silk Therapy Original Shampoo is still a force to be reckoned with. Every time I use it, I know that my hair will have wonderful body and smell absolutely amazing.\n\nFrom the moment you squeeze this sleek bottle into your hand, you know you\u2019re dealing with something more luxurious than your average cleansing agent. The milky serum glides through your hair with a satin caress thanks to its hydrolyzed silk proteins \u201417 of the 19 amino acids found naturally in hair \u2014 bolstering weakened strands and coaxing out an unmistakable sheen. It isn\u2019t flashy with thick suds; what it does is cleanse gently without stripping, letting its silk-derived nutrients and botanical extracts (think: lavender, peppermint, chamomile, each replenishing and fortifying from root to tip).\n\nThe result is hair that feels soft, looks luminous and moves with newfound grace. No wonder what It\u2019s a No. 1 top-rated beauty product on Amazon with nearly 50,000 glowing reviews.\n\nThe brand\u2019s Silk Therapy line shields locks from sun damage and pollutants, while panthenol draws moisture deep into the cortex. It\u2019s a shampoo that neither neglects purity nor performance: sulfate\u2011free, paraben\u2011free, and gluten\u2011free, it sidesteps harsh detergents for something more refined.\n\nUltimately, this is a product that taps into nostalgia as much as necessity. With roots stretching back to 1986, it\u2019s a cult classic reborn for today\u2019s conscience and damaged-hair dilemmas. It\u2019s the kind of shampoo you buy (and rebuy!) not for gimmicks, but because week after week, it delivers glossy resilience. Its ability to tame frizz is seriously impressive, and I know whenever I reach for it that my hair will look full and fabulous.\n\nPairs well with: Biosilk Silk Therapy Conditioner ($13); Biosilk Hydrating Therapy Leave-In Conditioner ($9)\n\nSize: 2.26 fluid ounces | Scent: Fruity | Testing Notes: Moisturizing formula\n\nBest Drugstore Shampoo: Dove Scalp+ Density Boost Hydrating Shampoo\n\n\u201cCheaper shampoos are more likely to contain harsh detergents or surfactants, which can strip the hair of natural oils, weakening it and leaving a residue that can cause breakage when combined with styling products,\u201d Andrew Fitzsimons, celebrity hairstylist for Kim Kardashian West and other high-profile names, said. \u201cThe key to finding the best drugstore shampoos is to read the ingredient list carefully. Opt for products with higher-quality components, fewer fillers and additives.\u201d\n\nEnter the Dove Scalp+ Density Boost Hydrating Shampoo. With a high-end feel, you won\u2019t believe it\u2019s less than $15. Its scent is fresh and it offers my locks a deep cleanse that leaves my hair feeling full and healthy.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it contains niacinamide \u2014 just like your skincare \u2014 which locks in hydration and allows my hair to feel just as healthy as my skin after I use a serum.\n\nPairs well with: Dove Scalp+ Density Boost Hydrating Conditioner ($8)\n\nSize: 9.25 fluid ounces | Scent: Fresh/Clean | Testing Notes: Sulfate-free\n\nBest Shampoo for Dry Hair: Moroccanoil Hydrating Shampoo\n\nFrom the makers of one of the best leave-in oils the haircare industry has to offer, Moroccanoil\u2019s Hydrating Shampoo is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 a blessing for dry hair.\n\nI love using this with the other brand\u2019s products \u2014 like the famous Moroccanoil Treatment ($48) and Luminous Hairspray ($26) when I\u2019m styling my hair. Plus, the scent is driven by paradise and it\u2019s an exceptional formula to try for your dry hair.\n\nPairs well with: Moroccanoil Hydrating Conditioner ($25)\n\nSize: 8.5 fluid ounces | Scent: Clean | Testing Notes: Highly moisturizing, great for those with heat-damaged hair\n\nBest Shampoo for Oily Hair: Dae Signature Shampoo\n\n\u201cThose who have oily hair should look for a shampoo that includes ingredients that are clarifying and exfoliating such as alpha-hydroxy acids but should stay away from sulfates which can overly strip the hair,\u201d Fitzsimons recommends. \u201cLactic acid, an AHA, works to break down the dead skin on the scalp and remove any product build up. This improves the scalp\u2019s natural moisture, keeping your hair hydrated and healthy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to find a shampoo that targets excessive sebum at the scalp. \u201cSebum is the body\u2019s natural oil and, when there is too much, the hair gets greasy and weighed down,\u201d Fitzsimons added.\n\nNot only is Dae\u2019s Daily Shampoo clad in a 60s retro bottle but it\u2019s one of the freshest scents and softest cleans your hair will ever be exposed to. When my hair tends to become oilier \u2014 especially after a workout \u2014 this shampoo is the one that performs the best.\n\nIdeal to capture oils and wonderful on straight and curly hair alike, this clean-formulated shampoo detoxifies impurities without stripping your hair of its natural oils.\n\nPairs well with: Dae Signature Conditioner ($28)\n\nSize: 10 fluid ounces | Scent: Citrus/Clean | Testing Notes: Vegan and sulfate-free\n\nBest Sulfate-Free Shampoo: 14th Night The Nourishing Shampoo\n\n\u201cSulfate-free alternatives are a little gentler than those with sulfates,\u201d Fitzsimons explains. \u201cIt\u2019s best for individuals with dry, frizzy curly hair texture, or color-treated hair. This type of shampoo helps to preserve the natural oils on the scalp and hair, resulting in more moisture in your hair.\u201d\n\nAmong all sulfate-free shampoos tested, the 14th Night The Nourishing Shampoo is the best one I tried. Not only is it ultra-nourishing on your hair (hence, its fitting name) but it *glistens* in gold once pumped into your hands. FYI, the brand was kickstarted by a former Vogue employee who just so happens to know a thing or two about haircare.\n\nExtraordinary and unique, there\u2019s no other shampoo quite like it. Now, it resides on my bathroom shelf and is never, ever leaving. Its scent is also better than the salon, and you\u2019ll appreciate how gentle of a cleanse it gives without stripping your hair.\n\nIf I may, it\u2019s a shampoo you have to use at least once.\n\nPairs well with: 14th Night The Nourishing Conditioner ($48)\n\nSize: 8 fluid ounces, | Scent: Vanilla/Amber | Testing Notes: Free of parabens, sulfates, mineral oils, phthalates, silicones and PEGs\n\nBest Shampoo for Itchy Scalp: OUAI Detox Shampoo\n\nTruthfully, OUAI\u2019s Detox Shampoo is a breath of fresh air on my strands. It\u2019s best on oily hair and deeply cleanses product buildup on my scalp, diminishing the effects of dandruff. It\u2019s formulated with apple cider vinegar and keratin that visibly work in tandem to strengthen hair strands. Oh, and the smell is like a salon in a bottle!\n\nPairs well with: OUAI Detangling and Frizz-Fighting Leave-In Conditioner ($32)\n\nSize: 10 fluid ounces | Scent: Floral | Testing Notes: Contains hair strengthening keratin\n\nBest Shampoo for Shine: amika Mirrorball High-Shine + Protect Antioxidant Shampoo\n\nThe brand amika is known for its captivating, alluring scents \u2014 and the Mirrorball High-Shine + Protect Antioxidant Shampoo is one of the best you\u2019ll find. It\u2019s a shampoo you\u2019ll want to regularly use and it helps mitigate frizz, most notably.\n\nOffering lightweight moisture, it acts as a clarifying shampoo \u2014 in a way \u2014 because it helps remove product buildup. Simply put, it\u2019s a surefire staple in my sulfate-free haircare routine.\n\nPairs well with: amika Mirrorball High-Shine + Protect Antioxidant Conditioner ($26)\n\nSize: 9.2 fluid ounces | Scent: Amber/vanilla | Testing Notes: Ideal for those looking to boost shine\n\nBest Shampoo for Men: Ulo Thickening Shampoo\n\nCalling all the men: If you\u2019re aiming to try a new shampoo that was thoughtfully curated with natural ingredients, the Ulo Thickening Shampoo is a best-in-class option. Better yet, it\u2019s not a shampoo that flaunts a clean label and that\u2019s it; this shampoo is infused with results-driven ingredients that\u2019ll nurture your scalp with each wash. The Post Wanted team reviewed it and can\u2019t stop raving about it.\n\nFor instance, glycerin and panthenol help your hair feel soft and hydrated, while hydrolyzed keratin and wheat protein help strengthen the strands for a thicker look. Additionally, caffeine and saw palmetto target hair growth, while rosemary and peppermint oil couple together to leave a crisp, subtle and refreshing scent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve used volumizing shampoos in the past, but my hair rarely sees any immediate results from using those products,\u201d Al Murillo, Senior Director of Commerce Partnerships, said after using the brand for months. \u201cWith the Ulo Thickening Shampoo, it was quite apparent as I was drying it that it suddenly had more body and bounce.\u201d\n\nAs a man with very thin hair, Murillo shared that his hair is always in peril of looking flat or becoming uncomfortably frizzy in certain conditions.\u201dIn order to achieve volume with strong support, I often have to rely on pomades and hair spray,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter using the Ulo Thickening Shampoo, my hair kept its fuller form. Most impressive is the fact that I didn\u2019t need to use a blow dryer to achieve the longer effects.\u201d\n\nThe crux of this brand is its clinically proven ingredients, which make you feel good about your hair wash days. From its catalog of approved ingredients come personalized treatments that are all doctor-approved. That\u2019s right \u2014 you can skip the in-person visits and enjoy a catered-to-you shampooing experience. Ah, yes.\n\nLooking for other men\u2019s haircare products? Check out our review of Ulo\u2019s Hair Growth Serum.\n\nSize: 8 ounces | Scent: Fresh, Peppermint-y | Testing Notes: Fuller, more volumized formula\n\nBest Shampoo for Split Ends: Dr. Groot Bond Fortifying Shampoo\n\nI can\u2019t shut up about the Dr. Groot Bond Fortifying Shampoo. It\u2019s truly a miracle for thinning hair and splitting ends. I wouldn\u2019t classify my hair as damaged per se, but at times when the ends seem untamable, this is the formula I typically reach for.\n\nThis Korean haircare brand is pretty much like glass skin for your hair; it results in an effortlessly shiny finish that will make you want to keep using it consistently. Better yet, it\u2019s infused with keratin and silk protein, both of which I feel instantly working on smoothing out my hair as it\u2019s time to rinse it out and condition. Do your hair a favor \u2014 try this shampoo.\n\nSize: 13 fluid ounces | Scent: White floral musk | Testing Notes: Good for thin, lifeless hair\n\nBest Dry Shampoo: I.C.O.N. Dry Shampoo\n\n\u201cDry shampoo is a powdery shampoo substitute that does not use water to cleanse hair,\u201d Abramite explains. \u201cIt can be used anytime the hair is feeling dirty, which for some is daily after a visit to the gym or for those who quickly get an oily scalp.\u201d\n\nBut, the golden question \u2014 what makes a dry shampoo good? According to Abramite, a good dry shampoo \u201cdoesn\u2019t leave visible powder or flakes in the hair for a dusty appearance.\u201d And, it should invigorate your style with a fresh scent.\n\nFitting the bill is the I.C.O.N. Dry Shampoo. I love it so much that I had to write a full review on its standout nature, coming above some brands you\u2019ve seen all over #BeautyTok. It\u2019s one of the only options that truly lasts all day and doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s building up into my scalp.\n\nThough it\u2019s a bit up there in price, it\u2019s worth it to effectively work when you don\u2019t want to *do the work* and wash your hair.\n\nPairs well with: I.C.O.N. Fully Shampoo ($28)\n\nSize: 5 fluid ounces | Scent: Clean | Testing Notes: Great at giving flat hair volume\n\nBest Shampoo for Dry Scalp: Dr. Groot Hair Thickening Shampoo\n\nMore people need to know about the Dr. Groot Hair Thickening Shampoo. Sure, Korean skincare is all the rage, but this product proves that Korean haircare is the next best thing.\n\nFor only $30, its prized blend of biotin and prebiotics directly results in my hair looking amazing each and every time. As someone who occasionally struggles with a dry scalp, one to two pumps of this product alleviate the \u201cdirty\u201d feeling.\n\nWhile the shampoo doesn\u2019t come with a matching conditioner, it\u2019s such a legendary product that you can mix and match with whatever product you want to apply to the ends of your hair. However, if you want that \u201cwow\u201d factor, grab the Dr. Groot Miracle In-Shower Treatment that, as marked on its label, takes five seconds to smooth your strands. Actually. See for yourself in the shower.\n\nPairs well with: Dr. Groot Miracle In-Shower Treatment ($30)\n\nSize: 13 fluid ounces | Scent: Fruity-floral | Testing Notes: Silicone and paraben-free\n\nBest Clarifying Shampoo: Raw Sugar Living The Deep Cleanse Shampoo\n\n\u201cClarifying shampoos, also known as purifying or deep cleansing shampoos, are designed to eliminate product buildup and natural oils from your hair that your regular shampoo may overlook,\u201d Fitzsimons said. \u201cClarifying shampoos should be used only when absolutely necessary, or once a month as they might be drying and can trigger sensitive reactions in some people.\u201d\n\nThis shampoo type is ideal to purify, exfoliate and detoxify the scalp and hair for overall good health, too, according to Abramite.\n\nTo the delight of your hair (and your wallet), the Raw Sugar Living The Deep Cleanse Shampoo is, by far, the best I\u2019ve reviewed in four years. Its matcha-infused, pleasing scent is second to none and the shine it gives makes everyone compliment its end result. My mom said it was the \u201cnicest my hair has looked in a while,\u201d and momma always knows best, after all.\n\nPairs well with: Raw Sugar Living The Mighty Cream Leave-In Cream Conditioner ($8)\n\nSize: 18 fluid ounces | Scent: Varied | Testing Notes: Vegan, and color-safe\n\nBest Volumizing Shampoo: amika Big Hit Volumizing Shampoo\n\nWhenever the word \u201cvolumizing\u201d is embossed on a hair product\u2019s label, I\u2019m usually the first one to run to it. My hair isn\u2019t \u201cflat\u201d by any means, but volume is always nice for my hair to exhibit, especially if I usually blow dry my hair and want the blowout to maintain its body and shape.\n\nThis shampoo doesn\u2019t let me down because it\u2019s fast-absorbing, hydrates and smoothes. I still think the Mirrorball High Shine + Protect collection is a step above the rest, but the Big Hit Volumizing catalog is the most versatile.\n\nEach time I use this shampoo and matching conditioner, my hair always feels as soft as a baby\u2019s bum. It\u2019s not volumizing to the point of no return, either. It provides lift while still being simple to manage, which I love. This makes it perfect for curly and coily hair types, I\u2019d imagine.\n\nIt\u2019s not as smoothing as the Velveteen Dream Smoothing Shampoo, though is a bit more lightweight and fast-absorbing.\n\nSize: 9.2 fluid ounces | Scent: Amber Vanilla | Testing Notes: Excellent for medium, normal hair types\n\nBest Shampoo for Hair Growth: PURA D\u2019OR Anti Hair-Thinning Biotin Shampoo\n\nWhat\u2019s revolutionary about the PURA D\u2019OR Anti Hair-Thinning Biotin Shampoo is its popularity, effectiveness and affordability, all infused into one pump-dispensing bottle. More than 20,000 shoppers bought it on Amazon this month alone and its formula is aloe vera-based to soothe your hair strands.\n\nAs someone with fairly oily hair, I love how this shampoo doesn\u2019t require a double rinse like most others on this list. Once styled, my hair was full and revitalized, and I love how many hair-boosting ingredients are found in its formula. You won\u2019t find artificial ones or a consistency that\u2019ll weigh down the hair either.\n\nAlthough infused with biotin to help promote hair growth when used consistently, it\u2019s not the best for those with dry scalp. While my hair looked full, other shampoos on this list were better suited for dry or flaky scalps a bit more. However \u2014 not a dealbreaker. The working power of this shampoo is quite extraordinary at helping to fluff up the hair at the root, creating more body at the ends of my hair.\n\nBest Shampoo for Curly Hair: AG Care Curl Fresh Curl Enhancing Shampoo\n\nI\u2019m just going to come out and say it \u2014 AG Hair\u2019s Curl Fresh Shampoo is the best shampoo for curly hair I\u2019ve tested. And, this shampoo will actually \u201cenhance your natural curls,\u201d as the formula doesn\u2019t weigh them down or mitigate their natural vivacity.\n\nThat said, this vegan formula would earn a six out of five stars if possible. Containing peptides, quinoa, keratin and rice extract, you won\u2019t find more of a superfood blend for your luscious locks.\n\n\u201cCurly hair tends to be dry so a moisturizing shampoo will soften curls, add bounce and define the shape,\u201d Abramite explains. \u201cA sulfate-free shampoo with amino acids gently cleanses without stripping natural oils and strengthens the internal structure by repairing cuticle damage.\u201d\n\nAnd, Fitzsimons echos this to a T. \u201cCurly hair tends to be much drier than those with straight hair because the natural oils from the scalp are unable to travel throughout the hair shaft and distribute moisture evenly, resulting in dry and fragile hair,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to look for very hydrating and non-stripping shampoos that contain ingredients that will reduce frizz without weighing down the curls.\u201d\n\nPairs well with: AG Hair Curl Fresh Conditioner ($34)\n\nSize: 12 fluid ounces | Scent: Herbaceous | Testing Notes: Paraben and sulfate-free. safe for chemically-treated hair\n\nBest Hydrating Shampoo: K\u00e9rastase Nutritive Bain Satin Shampoo\n\nYou can\u2019t come between me and the K\u00e9rastase Nutritive Bain Satin Shampoo. Enriched with niacinamide, it\u2019s one of the best to hydrate your hair while coating your strands with nutrients along the way. Consider it a vitamin for your hair whenever you reach hair-wash day.\n\nWith a gorgeous satin finish, it\u2019s revolutionary in that it doesn\u2019t weigh down my hair. Sure, it\u2019s a splurge, but the blowouts last long on my medium-thick hair, and I can go three days without washing. Typically, I wash my hair every other day.\n\nOverall, you\u2019ll feel like a member of the Royal Family when you use this shampoo. It\u2019s one of the best for long-term hair health and everyone I\u2019ve told to try it has become hooked on it ever since.\n\nPairs well with: K\u00e9rastase Nutritive Lait Vital Hydrating Conditioner ($44)\n\nSize: 8.5 fluid ounces | Scent: Floral | Testing Notes: Can also be used daily\n\nBest Shampoo for Color-Treated Hair: Pureology Hydrate Shampoo\n\nIf you want to extend the livelihood of your hair dye, highlights or gloss, the Pureology Hydrate Shampoo is a worthy pick to add to your cart right this instant. It makes me feel nostalgic, as this was the minty fresh shampoo my hairdresser first used on me when I began adding some highlights to my hair in high school.\n\nBecause it\u2019s thicker than some other shampoos you\u2019ll find, a little goes a long way. This proves that the value is there as the bottle will likely last you for six months straight, depending on how often you wash your hair, of course.\n\nInfused with vegan-derived ingredients, its formulation is always one that nourishes and cleanses without a hitch. Its scent is divine as well and it\u2019s a supreme option that I recommend anyone with color-treated hair to try next.\n\nPairs well with: Pureology Hydrate Moisturizing Conditioner ($37)\n\nSize: 9 fluid ounces | Scent: Herbaceous | Testing Notes: Also great for those with dry, heat-damaged hair\n\nBest Moisturizing Shampoo: Redken All Soft Shampoo\n\nIf you want your hair to have that \u201cblowout feeling,\u201d grab the Redken All Soft Shampoo. It allows your hair to feel lifted from the roots and thicker at the ends, making it a dynamite option that\u2019s truly worth every penny.\n\nWhenever I use it, I always catch myself running my fingers through the crown of my head (sometimes, I truly can\u2019t believe it feels that much thicker than before). Hailing from a trusted brand and topped with a delicious scent, it\u2019s one to pick up ASAP.\n\nPairs well with: Redken All Soft Conditioner ($26)\n\nSize: 10 fluid ounces | Scent: Mildy fragranced | Testing Notes: Good for all hair types\n\nBest for Body and Bounce: IGK Good Behavior Ultra Smooth Shampoo\n\nSometimes, all shampoos touting to smooth your strands look and feel the same \u2014 but not the IGK Good Behavior Ultra Smooth Shampoo.\n\nWith an alluring scent and gentle yet effective scrub, my hair feels clean, bouncy and full. In other words, it\u2019s a dream to use and is truly one of the highest quality shampoos that, while not as affordable as some drugstore options, is fairly priced for the end result you\u2019ll noticeably find.\n\nIt leads to a long-lasting blowout, too, though isn\u2019t the best for frizz. However, it does smooth out some baby hairs and subtle frizz, so I continue to use this product to give me that desirable clean feel, among other bouncy hair benefits.\n\nPairs well with: IGK Good Behavior Ultra Smooth Conditioner ($29)\n\nSize: 8 fluid ounces | Scent: Fresh | Testing Notes: A must-try for those with split ends or damaged hair\n\nBest Budget: Acure Ultra Hydrating Shampoo\n\nYou know a product is good when you simply have no words to describe it other than just buy it. In all seriousness, this shampoo smells like almond paste (delicious rainbow cookies if you\u2019re a fan) and makes my hair sudsy soft \u2014 in the best way possible.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s a shampoo I most frequently use in my hair-washing routine. You simply can\u2019t beat the price and it contains a rich amount of replenishing oils, which our experts approve of.\n\nPairs well with: Acure Ultra Hydrating Conditioner ($8)\n\nSize: 8 fluid ounces | Scent: Dessert-like | Testing Notes: Vegan-friendly\n\nYour shampoo questions, answered by hair experts\n\nHow often should I wash my hair?\n\n\u201cShampooing is a personal choice for everyone and one size does not fit all,\u201d Abramite said. \u201cOn average, people shampoo daily or at least once a week. The decision is typically made on how dirty the hair looks or feels from a build-up of product, dirt or oil in the hair or how physically active someone is at the gym.\u201d\n\nThough different for everyone, Fitzsimons recommends looking closely at your hair type.\n\n\u201cFrequent shampooing depletes your hair\u2019s natural oils and dries out your scalp,\u201d he said. \u201cThe average person can go two to three days without shampooing their hair. People with fine or greasy hair should wash their hair every other day in general.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, those with medium to thick, wavy, curly, coiled or damaged hair can normally go two to four days without washing \u2014 depending on if your curly hair has product buildup, your scalp is itchy or if you exercise regularly you can swap in co-washing between washes.\n\nHow do I properly apply shampoo (in other words, do I really have to rinse and repeat?)\n\n\u201cYou should aim to shampoo twice and rinse in between,\u201d Fitzsimons recommends. \u201cYour hair will get a lot stronger, shinier, and healthier. Over-shampooing can strip natural oils the scalp produces and can lead to dry, brittle and damaged hair.\u201d\n\nThe proper way to shampoo hair is to get it thoroughly wet with warm water to prepare it for the shampoo, Abramite offers. \u201cThis will immediately begin to loosen and break down the product. Add shampoo to your hands and begin to massage the scalp in a circular motion to work it into a lather. If the hair at the scalp doesn\u2019t lather right away, a second shampoo will be needed to break the product down further to remove.\u201d\n\nThen, rinse your hair thoroughly, add shampoo again, and repeat the scalp massage. Once a good lather gets going at the roots add the extra lengths of hair into the massage so the ends get cleansed as well. Rinse thoroughly with warm water and run fingers through hair to check to feel if the hair feels healthy and moisturized.\n\nHow much shampoo should I apply?\n\n\u201cThe amount depends on the density and the length of the hair,\u201d Abramite said. \u201cFor short hairstyles or fine hair, a dime size should be a good place to start. For longer or thicker hair, I recommend starting with a quarter-sized amount and adding more if needed for a good lather.\u201d\n\nHow long does shampoo last?\n\n\u201cIf the seal has been broken on the shampoo bottle and used, it will expire in about a year,\u201d Abramite explains. \u201cIf you\u2019re not sure when it was opened, a smell test will do. If the fragrance has a foulness to it, toss it.\u201d\n\nWhat is the benefit of choosing a shampoo with apple cider vinegar?\n\n\u201cApple cider vinegar\u2019s acidic properties can help improve chemically damaged hair by lowering the hair\u2019s pH level by sealing the cuticles,\u201d Fitzsimons recommends. \u201cIt can also help to regulate the microbiome on the scalp by reducing inflammation and removing build-up, restoring luster and preventing tangling in the hair.\u201d\n\nWhat is a \u201cvolumizing shampoo?\u201d\n\n\u201cA volumizing shampoo creates weightless lift at the root area resulting in fullness and body,\u201d Abramite said.\n\nWhat is a \u201cdensifying shampoo?\u201d\n\nAccording to Abramite, a densifying shampoo \u201cplumps individual strands for thicker-looking hair with more substance.\u201d\n\nWhat is a \u201cstrengthening shampoo?\u201d\n\n\u201cA strengthening shampoo fortifies the internal structure of the hair strand by rebonding to prevent damage and breakage,\u201d per Abramite.\n\nHow we tested\n\nAfter reviewing dozens of shampoos for more than two years, it\u2019s safe to say I found a testing process that works for me. Here\u2019s the criteria I used when testing each one:\n\nViscosity: Before I scare you off with a highly scientific term, this point simply refers to how thick or lightweight the formulation felt in my hands (and then, my hair) once emitted from the tube. Any formulations that were incredibly thick or, on the flipside, far too runny, didn\u2019t make the cut.\n\nScent: Whether a shampoo costs $1 or $100, if it doesn\u2019t smell good \u2014 it\u2019s not worth it, IMHO. I made sure to point out which scents instantly transported me to a salon, among all the shampoos that made the cut.\n\nLongevity: Of course, how often you wash your hair is dependent on your hair type and thickness. However, I had a confident understanding of which ones seemed to make my hair flat after using a blow-dryer brush to style and which ones held the blowout for at least two days.\n\nAn overview of my hair type\n\nI like to say my hair type is a little bit of everything, which made testing a unique experience for touching on different hair types and textures. My hair is the Goldilocks of texture (not too thick or too thin) and is a hybrid of curly and wavy.\n\nBut, when blown out, I can lean to almost straight \u2014 as long as slight frizz is tame (which, can rely heavily on choosing the right shampoo).\n\nWhat\u2019s more, after visiting a dermatologist, I realized I have a dry scalp (which is pure genetics) and find that dandruff shampoos help mitigate severe dryness. However, my hair tends to become oily if I don\u2019t wash it every other day.\n\nPlainly stated, I\u2019m a mut of hair types, which is why I wanted to get to the bottom of which shampoo makes my hair the least oily, the least dry and how I can avoid formulas that simply won\u2019t work well.\n\nHow to choose the right shampoo for your hair type, per experts\n\n\u201cThe key is to identify the primary challenge with the hair or scalp and specifically target that concern,\u201d Abramite adds. \u201cFor example, if the hair is feeling dry to the touch, a hydrating shampoo will nourish the strands and balance moisture for optimal health.\u201d\n\nNot only that, but ingredients play a big role. \u201cYou should make sure the shampoo is suitable for your hair type and addresses any issues you may be experiencing, such as dandruff, dull and lifeless hair or damaged hair,\u201d Andrew Fitzsimons, celebrity hairstylist for Kim Kardashian, Megan Fox, Jennifer Lopez and more, told the Post. \u201cIt\u2019s critical to check ingredients for harmful chemicals to avoid exacerbating your hair problems further.\u201d\n\nWhy Trust Post Wanted by the New York Post\n\nThis article was written by Victoria Giardina, New York Post Commerce Journalist & Content Strategist, who has spent countless hours researching, testing hundreds of products and comparing the latest makeup, skincare, hair and beauty items and trends to determine what\u2019s truly worth your hard-earned cash.

                "text": "We might go full \u201cArmageddon\u201d on asteroid 2024 YR4.\n\nAfter mulling several different solutions, scientists have devised an unconventional method to stop the \u201ccity killer\u201d space rock from hitting the moon \u2014 by blowing it up with nukes. Their unorthodox measure of preventing a potential lunar crash landing was detailed recently in a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed study published on the arXiv preprint server.\n\nThe team, which includes experts from NASA, wrote that \u201cnuclear robust disruption missions\u201d could be launched in as little as four years from now.\n\nFirst discovered in December 2024, YR4 sparked worldwide concern that it could strike our planet on December 23, 2032, potentially generating enough power to destroy an entire city.\n\nNASA\u2019s Center for Near Earth Objects has since downgraded the likelihood of the space rock striking home to a negligible 0.00081% chance, but upped the chances of it hitting the moon on that date to over 4%.\n\nIf this were to happen, the cosmic collision could cause a cloud of shrapnel to impact Earth-orbiting satellites and spacecraft, while displaced matter could fall back to the moon, impeding rovers and even jeopardizing astronauts with the Artemis program.\n\nTo prevent this a-rock-alyptic outcome, the researchers proposed a \u201ckinetic disruption mission\u201d in which the space rock is blown apart with \u201cnuclear explosive devices\u201d like the plot of the dystopian thriller \u201cArmageddon.\u201d\n\nThe team proposed dispatching two 100-kiloton nuclear devices capable of auto-piloting themselves to YR4 \u2014 which measures over 300 feet in length \u2014 and detonating with a force roughly five to eight times more powerful than the atomic bombs the United States dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in 1945, Futurism reported.\n\nMeanwhile, a second explosive device would be kept \u201conboard in case it is needed,\u201d per the researchers. \u201cOtherwise, it can be safely disposed of by detonating it in deep space after the asteroid is successfully deflected by the first one,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe team\u2019s other proposed solution was a deflection mission like NASA\u2019s 2022 Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), in which a spacecraft knocked an asteroid called Dimorphos off course by ramming it at high speed.\n\nHowever, they ultimately ruled it out on the grounds that there would not be enough time to conduct reconnaissance on the size and mass of the object.\n\nThis would be an essential step before launching an interception op on the rock, which is 379 million miles away.\n\n\u201cDeflection missions were assessed and appear impractical,\u201d scientists wrote.\n\nNot to mention that a recon mission wouldn\u2019t be able to launch until 2028, leaving defense systems only three years to intercept the threat.\n\nBy contrast, the team postulated that NASA could have anywhere from five to seven years to formulate the nuclear option, while the window for a launch ranges from 2029 to late 2031, Futurism reported.\n\nOf course, we might not need to go to DEFCON four just yet \u2014 researchers reiterated that YR4 only has a slim chance of a lunar impact.\n\nNonetheless, this nuclear option presents yet another potential method of deflecting dangerous near-Earth space rocks in the future."

And finding the tension, drama and passion within that longevity,\u201d Kreuk said.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s an ease to \u2018Will they or won\u2019t they,\u2019 or love triangles, but I always wanted to see \u2013 we don\u2019t normally spend the majority of our time in \u2018will they or won\u2019t they,\u2019 \u201d she added. \u201cWe end up in relationships. And, there\u2019s beautiful drama within that.\u201d\n\nKreuk rose to fame starring on \u201cSmallville,\u201d the show about a young Superman which aired for 10 seasons between 2001 and 2011.\n\nThe show followed a young Clark Kent (Tom Welling), and his youthful adventures, including his romance with neighbor Lana Lang (Kreuk) and his friendship with Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum).\n\nIn the age of constant reboots and revivals, The Post asked if she\u2019d be open to revisiting it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny, Tom and Michael who played Clark and Lex talked about a reboot of sorts for years, in an animated form \u2013 which feels like the way that you would do something like \u2018Smallville,\u2019 when all of us are old now,\u201d she said.\n\nThe \u201cBurden of Truth\u201d actress pointed out that since everyone has aged, she doesn\u2019t know that it would be possible to revisit the story again \u201cas it was.\u201d\n\nBut, she added, \u201cwe\u2019ll see what they end up doing with an animated idea.\u201d\n\nSince the show, Henry Cavill\u2019s \u201cMan of Steel\u201d debuted in theaters and the most recent \u201cSuperman\u201d movie came out in July, starring David Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahan. Kreuk thinks the different \u201cSuperman\u201d stories are for different people, and different times.\n\nFor instance, she noted, when \u201cSmallville\u201d was airing, 9/11 and the Iraq war were the main topics in the headlines.\n\n\u201cThere was a real desire for a clear moral compass, and for somebody who could clearly save things. And I think there\u2019s a desire for such things now as well. These are iconic stories that I think will go on forever,\u201d Kreuk said. \u201cThey might go away for a while. But there\u2019s truth within them that storytellers can come back to, always.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmallville\u201d also became notorious for actress Allison Mack, who was involved in Nxivm, the sex cult that was the subject of numerous documentaries, including HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Vow\u201d and \u201cSeduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult.\u201d\n\nMack was sentenced to three years in prison in 2021 after pleading guilty for her role in helping to brainwash women into becoming sex slaves for Nxivm leader Keith Raniere, and was released from prison in July 2023.\n\nKreuk spoke about the topic in 2018. At the time, she said that she left the group \u201cfive years ago\u201d and was \u201chorrified and disgusted\u201d by the information that had since come out about it.\n\nWhen The Post asked about it, she declined to discuss it."

Despite concerns over low birth rates, researchers note that the U.S. population continues to grow due to a natural increase, as people are marrying and having children later in life for economic and personal reasons.",
                "source": "nypost",
                "text": "The U.S. birth rate plunged to an all-time low in 2024 after being on a downward trajectory for roughly 20 years, with soaring housing costs widely cited as a major contributing factor.\n\nEarlier this summer, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released updated birth data for the previous year, revealing that the nation\u2019s fertility rate decreased to fewer than 1.6 kids per woman, down from 2.1 kids per woman recorded in 2006, which is the rate the country needs to sustain its population.\n\nThe last two decades saw women increasingly delaying having children, or choosing not to have them at all. There are many factors fueling this trend, including personal and cultural, and one of them is the rising housing costs, according to some experts.\n\nData analyzed by Realtor.com\u00ae economists show that from 2006 to 2024, the financial burden of purchasing a home has grown dramatically.\n\nIn 2006, the median price of a single-family home was $221,923, which translates to about $343,806 in 2024 dollars when adjusted for inflation. By comparison, the median sale price in 2024 was $410,100, more than $66,000 higher in real terms than the 2006 equivalent.\n\nOver the same 18-year period, the U.S. total fertility rate dropped from about 2.1 births per woman to just under 1.6 births.\n\nWhat experts say\n\n\u201cLarger homes that can comfortably accommodate multiple children have become increasingly out of reach for many families,\u201d says Realtor.com senior economic research analyst Hannah Jones. \u201cAs prices have far outpaced wage growth, couples may delay homeownership or remain in smaller homes longer, limiting the space available for growing families.\u201d\n\nA study published by the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research in 2012 found that home prices have a significant impact on family planning.\n\nIn the research paper titled \u201cHouse Prices and Birth Rates: The Impact of the Real Estate Market on the Decision to Have a Baby,\u201d authors Lisa Dettling and Melissa Schettini Kearney write that a 10% jump in home prices leads to a 1% drop in births among non-homeowners in an average metro.\n\nAs part of the study, Dettling, principal economist with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and Schettini Kearney, then a research associate at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Department of Economics, looked at fertility rates of women ages 20 to 44 in 66 metros from 1990 through 2006.\n\nDuring that 16-year stretch, U.S. birth rates remained relatively flat as average median home sale prices steadily increased.\n\nThe paper explains that rising home prices exert downward pressure on birth rates because they represent, on average, the largest expense associated with raising a child, far surpassing food, child care, and education.\n\nSo when the price of housing goes up, the cost of having children follows suit, leading some couples to pump the brakes on having kids, or to have fewer children over their lifetime. Additionally, the paper suggests that house price changes are even more important than unemployment rates in driving birth rates.\n\n\u201cHouse prices are a relevant factor in a couple\u2019s decision to have a baby,\u201d write Dettling and Schettini Kearney.\n\nJones points out that for prospective parents, the financial stress of competing for scarce, expensive housing can make the prospect of having additional offspring \u201cseem less feasible or even risky.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, for existing homeowners, rising home prices can actually spur a baby boom.\n\nFor the typical U.S. family, housing makes up a large portion of household wealth in the form of equity, so when home prices increase, the homeowners\u2019 wealth grows as well. According to the paper, this can lead them to have children sooner and to have more of them.\n\nOn top of that, cash-strapped families who own a home can even use their equity to pay for child-related expenses such as schooling.\n\nOther factors impacting birth rates\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, however, that when it comes to national fertility rates, housing costs represent just one factor, which is why there are periods in recent history when both home prices and birth rates trended up at the same time.\n\nJones explains that in the early 2000s, expanding credit and economic growth made larger homes more attainable. Feeling financially secure, many Americans opted to welcome more children, even as home prices increased.\n\nBut from 2008 through 2011, both home prices and birth rates nosedived.\n\n\u201cThe housing bust and Great Recession not only reduced home values but also pushed up unemployment, delaying or derailing the plans of families hoping to buy homes and have children,\u201d says Jones.\n\nAfter 2012, home prices began rising again while the birth rate continued declining, suggesting that higher costs and tighter supply in the post-recession housing market have increasingly become a barrier to having children.\n\nPut simply, as the financial hurdle of buying larger homes to accommodate larger families has risen, many Americans have been forced to either put off having kids, or have fewer of them, or none, reinforcing the downward trend in U.S. birth rates.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make housing the sole cause of falling birth rates, but it is likely an important structural constraint on family size in today\u2019s economy,\u201d notes Jones.\n\nGeography and fertility rates\n\nLocation also plays an important part in family planning.\n\nA 2012 study authored by Dr. William A. V. Clark, a research professor of geography at UCLA, found that women living in expensive housing markets like New York City or Boston delay having their first child by three to four years.\n\nClark points out that pricier metros have a higher share of women with advanced college degrees who are interested in pursuing careers, which may lead them to put off motherhood.\n\n\u201cWe can suggest that high cost housing markets create a threshold for fertility behavior,\u201d writes Clark, adding, however, that there is no evidence that expensive housing markets suffer from lower completed fertility rates\u2014the actual number of children born to women by the end of their childbearing years\u2014compared with more affordable markets.\n\nSo even if women put off having their first child by a few years to focus on their eduction or work goals, the researcher argues that they are \u201cstill able to complete their fertility expectations\u201d over time.\n\nLow birth rates raise concerns\n\nThe record low fertility rate of fewer than 1.6 kids per woman that was recorded last year set off alarm bells in Washington, DC, this year, prompting the administration of President Donald Trump to issue an executive order aimed at expanding families\u2019 access to in vitro fertilization, and consider offering \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d in a bid to convince couples to have more children, as The Associated Press reported in July.\n\nBut Dr. Leslie Root, a University of Colorado Boulder researcher studying fertility and population policy, insisted that there is no real cause for concern.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this as part of an ongoing process of fertility delay. We know that the U.S. population is still growing, and we still have a natural increase\u2014more births than deaths,\u201d she told the AP.\n\nThe fact is, Americans are marrying later than before and women are waiting longer to get pregnant for a variety of reasons, including financial concerns, and employment and economic uncertainty. Researchers agree this trend is not about to change anytime soon."

                "text": "Rithm Capital\u2019s prospective purchase of Paramount Group is a stroke of faith in the strength of the Manhattan office market, which is where most of Paramount\u2019s holdings are concentrated.\n\nThe deal would give Rithm, a major force in commercial and residential credit and asset management, a significant, 13.1 million square-feet, bricks-and-mortar stake for the first time.\n\nSeveral major players including SL Green and Blackstone reportedly made offers as well after Paramount quietly announced in April it was seeking \u201cstrategic alternatives.\u201d\n\nBut if Paramount shareholders approve the sale, the new owners might shuffle some of the deck in Paramount\u2019s 11-building Manhattan portfolio, sources told Realty Check. (Paramount also has five properties in San Francisco which aren\u2019t doing as well but are rebounding from that city\u2019s malaise).\n\nRithm CEO Michael Nierenberg has such a low public profile, he doesn\u2019t even have a personal Wikipedia entry. He declined to comment directly, as both Rithm and Paramount are subject to Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rules. (He would say only through a spokesman he was \u201cthrilled and excited\u201d to soon welcome Paramount\u2019s \u201cexcellent\u201d real estate team.)\n\nIn a statement, he called the Paramount acquisition a \u201cgenerational opportunity to that will serve as a springboard to build out our commercial real estate and asset management platform and expands our owner-operator model.\u201d\n\nMarket sources said they expected what one called \u201crationalization\u201d of Paramount\u2019s Manhattan holdings. That might include capital upgrades to several buildings that \u201care in need of love,\u201d as one put it.\n\nSales of certain Paramount buildings by Rithm aren\u2019t out of the question, our source said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to examine every asset very closely, in New York as well as in San Francisco.\u201d\n\nApart from 60 Wall St. \u2013 the currently empty tower which Paramount and its institutional partners are spending $250 million to modernize and beautify \u2013 Paramount\u2019s holdings such as 900 Third Ave. and 31 West 52nd St. have been largely absent from our recent stories about big-budget Midtown upgradings beyond lobby improvements.\n\nMeanwhile, there could be a breakthrough soon at 60 Wall St. The Post\u2019s Lois Weiss reported in June that law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, Moody\u2019s and Aon have all looked at the tower for possible relocations or expansions. No leases have yet been signed but a brokerage source said on Friday there\u2019s \u201ca lot of paper being traded.\u201d\n\nParamount\u2019s Manhattan holdings are 88.1% leased, the most since early 2022. The data announced in the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call didn\u2019t include 60 Wall\u2019s 1.6 million empty square feet. But as we reported last year, Paramount\u2019s equity in that tower is a mere 5%.\n\nSome other publicly-traded REITS such as SL Green have higher percentages of space leased and higher asking rents than Paramount.\n\nThe sale to Rithm is under scrutiny by analysts and by some Paramount shareholders who say the $1.6 billion price \u2013 or $6.60 per share \u2013 is too low.\n\nMeanwhile, the SEC is reportedly looking into certain payments made to Paramount CEO Alfred Behler. It\u2019s unclear how that would be affected by a sale to Rithm, although a buyer typically assumes any liabilities of the purchased entity.\n\nRithm, which was founded by Fortress in 2013 and became fully self-managed in 2022, claims it has over $100 billion in investable assets.\n\nMilestone news: An 11,321 square-foot lease with BAM Labs brought L&L Holding Company\u2019s reconfigured 150 Fifth Ave. to 100% office and retail occupancy.\n\nThe studio, BAM\u2019s first in the US, will be situated along the building\u2019s West 20th Street side.\n\nL&L recently transformed the 11-story property into a more collaborative and efficient work environment. Mastercard\u2019s 227,500 square feet fill the boutique property\u2019s entire office portion.\n\nAlthough hearts were broken at SL Green over a state panel\u2019s rejection of its Times Square casino bid with Caesars Resorts, the developer can take heart that 1515 Broadway \u2013 the proposed gaming site \u2013 remains in sound shape.\n\nThe office portion is fully leased through 2031 to Paramount Global (formerly Viacom), which is responsible for rent payments even if it downsizes as reports have suggested it might do.\n\nA $742 million mortgage on the tower was recently extended on favorable terms to 2028. And crowds continue to flock to \u201cThe Lion King\u201d at the Minskoff Theatre inside the tower."

                "article_summary": "German influencer Melissa Winkler's engagement announcement went viral, but not for the reasons she hoped; her post about her diamond ring was met with harsh criticism over its size, with many commenters deeming it \"tiny\" and suggesting she should have declined the proposal. While some defended the ring's modesty, emphasizing that the significance of the engagement should outweigh material concerns, experts noted that societal expectations around engagement rings have shifted towards larger stones, largely influenced by celebrity culture and the availability of lab-grown diamonds. Winkler expressed her surprise at the backlash, stating she is simply happy and grateful for her engagement.",

                "text": "An influencer\u2019s engagement announcement has gone viral for all the wrong reasons after her happy post was flooded with nasty comments, exposing a \u201cdisappointing\u201d truth.\n\nMelissa Winkler, a fashion and lifestyle creator from Germany with just 3500 followers, recently amassed 20 million views on a photograph of her diamond engagement ring.\n\nBut while she declared \u201cforever sounds like paradise\u201d with her new fianc\u00e9, thousands flooded the comments section to criticize the modest size of the stone, claiming its \u201ctiny\u201d measurement should have resulted in her saying \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said yes,\u201d snarked one.\n\n\u201cWith that ring?\u201d teased another.\n\nWhile one rudely remarked, \u201cCould he not afford a proper ring \u2026 looks like a children\u2019s cheap ring.\u201d\n\nTalitha Cummins, founder of The Cut Jewellery, said expectations around rings have shifted in recent years as celebrities and social media put pressure on couples to get engaged with a large, oversized diamond.\n\n\u201cThe bigger ring trend often comes down to two things. The first is celebrities who typically choose engagement rings of larger carat weight. We\u2019ve seen that recently with Taylor Swift\u2019s choice of an approximate 8-carat old mine cut diamond, and also Hailey Bieber,\u201d she told news.com.au.\n\n\u201cSecondly, lab-grown diamonds have created more accessibility to larger stones, and it\u2019s more common to see an engagement ring between 3 and 4 carats when previously this would have been reserved for only a very small clientele.\n\n\u201cThis has shifted the goalposts in terms of our expectations of what an engagement ring should be.\u201d\n\nBut while there were hundreds of negative comments to Ms Winkler\u2019s sparkler, there were just as many who defended the ring and its apparent lack of size.\n\n\u201cThis ring is actually refreshing to see. I\u2019m tired of rings looking like they popped out of a gumball machine,\u201d wrote one.\n\n\u201cI personally LOVE dainty jewellery and love your ring!!\u201d said another.\n\nAs one shared: \u201cOh I long for the days when a proposal was a celebration of love and not a statement of wealth. Your ring is gorgeous.\u201d\n\nOthers argued the backlash to Ms Winkler\u2019s ring was a reflection of the fact we are \u201cliving in such a materialistic world\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s really sad.\u201d\n\nCummings, who is opening a store in Sydney later this month, said it\u2019s the \u201cthought, meaning and sentiment that counts\u201d when it comes to proposing \u2013 not the size.\n\n\u201cI have always thought that it\u2019s disappointing that people would judge someone\u2019s ring when that\u2019s not what the milestone is about at all,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe narrative around ring judgement needs to change. Some people prefer daintier jewellery, and sometimes, they have other goals in mind, such as buying a house or having kids, so why should they feel they need to break the bank on a ring, when it should be more about the moment?\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know people\u2019s financial circumstances or personal preferences and it\u2019s quite sad that people are judging her on the size of her diamond.\u201d\n\nWinkler has since reacted to the mean commentary surrounding her sparkler, stating she had no idea it would become such a hot topic of conversation.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t expect to go viral over my engagement. All I know is I\u2019m happy, I\u2019m grateful & I said YES!!\u201d she wrote alongside a video showing off the ring.\n\nMany declared her future husband had \u201chit the jackpot,\u201d though there were some who still wondered whether the whole thing was a stunt.\n\n\u201cThis has to be a joke, right?\u201d asked one.\n\n\u201cGirl!!! Stop playing with us now,\u201d remarked another, while one pressed: \u201cIs this rage bait? I\u2019m very confused.\u201d\n\nWith the rise in popularity of lab-grown diamonds, it\u2019s likely we won\u2019t see the trend of bigger rocks die down.\n\nData estimates that lab-grown jewels make up about 35 to 40 per cent of diamond sales in Australia.\n\nDepending on their quality, the cost of a lab-grown diamond is around 40 to 50 per cent less than an earth-mined diamond, Forbes reported in 2019."

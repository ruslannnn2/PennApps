        "article_summary": "A recent poll commissioned by Matthews revealed that about one in six women in the U.S. wear weighted vests, with this group slightly favoring Donald Trump in the 2024 election. However, for the upcoming 2026 congressional elections, their political support is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats. The poll also highlighted generational differences in vaccine skepticism, particularly among Gen Z women, who are more likely to rely on social media and personal research over traditional medical advice.",
        "source": "Politico",
        "text": "Matthews’ wanted answers to two simple questions: How many women were wearing weighted vests? And what were their politics? So she commissioned a poll of 1,000 women across the U.S., the results of which she shared exclusively with POLITICO.\n\nMatthews found that about one in six women wear this year’s hottest wellness accessory. But more importantly, the weighted vest women broke for President Donald Trump by three points in 2024.\n\nGoing into 2026, though, this group backs Republicans and Democrats equally at 47 percent in a generic congressional ballot. Among all women surveyed, 48 percent would vote for Democrats compared to 35 percent for Republicans.\n\n“The people who swing elections, it always sort of comes down — in particular in midterms — to suburban women,” Matthews said in an interview with POLITICO. “This, to me, is just a particularly interesting cohort that is a subset of that group that could swing these elections because they’re so engaged. They look like they’re definite midterm voters.”\n\nThese voters are “under age 45, have kids at home, and live in urban/suburban neighborhoods, [are] well-educated, higher-income and highly engaged with politics,” according to Matthews’ poll deck.\n\n“While much more likely to ‘do their own research’ on health matters, they generally trust mainstream medicine and media,” according to the poll deck. “They aren’t vaccine skeptics or seed oil opponents. They are likely to be listening to a podcast while walking with a weighted vest. They are politically split.”\n\nMatthews acknowledges that the weighted vest women comprise a small cohort, which could lead to a higher margin of error. “So we want to track them and get more data going forward,” she said.\n\nMore broadly, the poll found that 31 percent of Gen Z women disagree that vaccines are “generally safe,” and are turning to social media, influencers, podcasts and self-research over doctors and institutions for information. Gen Z women are twice as likely as Boomer women to be vaccine skeptics.\n\nThe survey also identified “a worrisome trend” among younger moms: 47 percent of moms to kids under 18 “primarily turn to doctors and the medical establishment for advice,” 32 percent “say they do their own research,” 15 percent “follow natural or holistic approaches” and 11 percent “rely on advice from friends/family.”\n\nSome 71 percent of women say vaccines are safe. Democratic women are more confident about vaccine safety than Republican and independent women. Only 24 percent of Republican women strongly agree that vaccines administered in the U.S. are generally safe, while 49 percent of Democratic women strongly agree and 23 percent of independent women strongly agree. Meanwhile, 20 percent of GOP women and 16 percent of Democratic women say seed oils are unhealthy. And women who say seed oils are unhealthy are more likely to be vaccine skeptics.\n\nIt’s not yet clear what the defining issues for the weighted vest wearers in the midterms will be, and Matthews plans to commission more research about them in the coming weeks and months. But they appear to lean more conservative than the median voter.\n\n“They have a modern diet of information that is heavily influenced by new media, social streams and podcasts,” Matthews said. “But it doesn’t cause them to go down weird fringe rabbit holes. It encourages them to adopt something like a weighted vest, but not, like, oppose vaccines.”"

This decision follows a broader trend of the federal government rolling back vaccine recommendations for specific populations, including healthy pregnant women and children. The committee's recent changes, along with the controversial leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have sparked confusion and criticism within the medical community regarding vaccine safety and efficacy.",

He replaced the members of the vaccine advisory panel in June, and fired its chief Susan Monarez in late August, provoking a group of senior staff to resign in protest.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dr Monarez told the Senate she was fired for refusing to sign off on changes to vaccine policy \"regardless of the scientific evidence\".\n\nEarlier this month, Kennedy said he dismissed Dr Monarez because he felt their interactions demonstrated she was not trustworthy.\n\nDoctors and health experts have criticised the health secretary's longstanding questioning of the safety and efficacy of a number of vaccines, although in his Senate confirmation hearing he said he was \"not going to take them away\"."

At the Conservative Political Action Conference in Brisbane, Abbott and other Coalition figures emphasized the need for the Liberal party to strengthen its identity and policies, particularly in opposition to Labor’s climate targets. Jacinta Nampijinpa Price echoed these sentiments, advocating for a shift away from the net zero climate target and urging party unity to reclaim conservative support.",
        "source": "Guardian",
        "text": "Tony Abbott has urged conservatives to give the Liberals “one last chance” and apologised for the party’s 2025 election drubbing, joining a host of high-profile Coalition figures at a major political conference in imploring voters not to abandon the opposition for right-wing minor parties.\n\nJacinta Nampijinpa Price, recently dumped from the shadow frontbench, exhorted the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) in Brisbane to stick with the Liberal party, and encouraged her parliamentary colleagues to dump a net zero climate target, to cheers from attendees.\n\nAbbott told Cpac in his headlining speech: “We must be a better opposition this time than last time, and we must be a better government next time than last time.”\n\n“I hope that you will give us one last chance to prove ourselves worthy of your trust,” he said, later repeating his request for another “chance to earn your trust”.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nAbbott, a former Liberal prime minister, also called for “reform” of the party to remove the power of “factional warlords”. It was in response to a bubbling discussion in Australia about whether a different major conservative party could emerge outside the established Liberal or National ones.\n\nReferencing Nigel Farage’s Reform party in the UK, leading in polls over the traditional conservatives, Abbott said: “I don’t say that something like that should never, ever happen here in Australia. But what we need right now in Australia is not a reform party, but a reformed party. A reformed Liberal party.”\n\nAudience members at several points interjected during Abbott’s speech, yelling support for Pauline Hanson and One Nation. Hanson will speak at the conference on Sunday, while conservative politicians Alex Antic, Matt Canavan and former British prime minister Liz Truss were among Saturday’s speakers.\n\nCoalition sources remained concerned about losing support on their left and right to more moderate “teal” or independent MPs as well as to more right-wing parties like One Nation. A recent Newspoll showed the Coalition’s primary vote at its lowest-ever ebb, just 27%, while One Nation had risen to 10%.\n\nChanges to the Coalition were a common theme for speakers. Price asked attendees to help in “shaping” the Liberal party, which she said must be “smarter” and “sharper”. She branded May’s election defeat as “a Coalition failure”, having “lost our nerve to prosecute policies of difference from Labor”.\n\n“We need to return to being a strong centre-right party – in conviction, in policy, and in practice,” she said.\n\nPrice again urged Liberal colleagues to dump the net zero by 2050 target agreed by former PM Scott Morrison. She branded the climate target “communism”, saying: “It’s time the Liberals pushed back against this freedom-eroding nonsense.”\n\nAbbott also urged Liberals to strongly oppose Labor’s climate action, claiming this week’s announcement of a 62-70% by 2035 reduction target “could be this government’s political death warrant”.\n\nThe opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said she doesn’t support setting climate targets in opposition, but that the Coalition was still reviewing its net zero position, and remained committed it.\n\nWarren Mundine, the chair of Cpac who has run for Liberal pre-selection after serving as Labor party president, said conservative voters needed to cooperate to win future elections.\n\n“We’ve got a battle; we get the conservative side of politics back together, and this is the beginning of it. We need to bring all the conservative groups together. One thing in the lesson that we’ve learned from the left is: how do we do preferences and support each other?” he said.\n\nMundine asked Cpac attendees to listen to the “brave Liberal and National party people” who would speak at the conference, saying “they’re going to be our champions”.\n\nDeputy Liberal leader Ted O’Brien, who along with Ley was supported by the party’s moderate wing to win a leadership ballot after Peter Dutton’s election defeat, was heckled by some attendees during his address. As he called Albanese’s government “the worst since Whitlam”, several audience members loudly interjected with “what are you going to do about it?” and “it starts with you”.\n\nO’Brien also admitted the need “to rebuild the Liberal party”.\n\nNationals senator Bridget McKenzie, the shadow transport minister, said the “centre-right of politics … has to stop fighting amongst ourselves”.\n\n“Because how the enemy has done this to us; [they are] highly disciplined, very well-financed, and relentless, militant in their intent over time. We tend to just bag each other out.”"

While the exact motive is still not known, on Sunday - before Kimmel spoke - the Utah governor had said the suspect was \"indoctrinated by leftist ideology\".\n\nThe FCC is in charge of granting broadcast licences to networks such as ABC, NBC and CBS, and they are required under statute to be in the public interest.\n\nOn his podcast Verdict with Ted Cruz, the senator emphasised on Friday that he hated what Kimmel said about Kirk, and he is \"thrilled that he was fired\". He also said Carr was \"a good guy\".\n\n\"But what he [Carr] said there is dangerous as hell,\" Cruz added. \"And so he threatens, explicitly, we're going to cancel ABC's licence.\n\n\"We're going to take them off the air so ABC cannot broadcast anymore. He says we can do this the easy way, or we could do this the hard way, yeah. And I got to say that's right out of Goodfellas.\n\n\"That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar going, nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,\" he added, using a mobster voice.\n\nHe warned that if the government gets into the business of bans and regulating what the media says \"that will end up bad for conservatives\".\n\n\"Going down this road, there will come a time when a Democrat wins again – wins the White House … they will silence us. They will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly. And that is dangerous,\" Cruz said.\n\nIn the Oval Office on Friday, President Donald Trump defended Carr and said \"I disagree with Ted Cruz\", who is ordinarily one of his staunchest allies.\n\nAnother Republican Senator, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, told reporters that Cruz was \"absolutely right\" in his criticism of Carr.\n\nTillis, who will not seek re-election next year, said the FCC chairman's comments were \"just unacceptable behaviour\".\n\nRepublicans in Congress have generally been toeing the party line with their response to Kimmel's suspension as the nation is shaken by the political and cultural aftershocks of Kirk's killing.\n\nBut Senator Jerry Moran, a Republican from Kansas, sounded a note of caution on Thursday.\n\n\"The conservative position is free speech is free speech, and we better be very careful about any lines we cross in diminishing free speech,\" Moran told Politico.\n\nSouth Dakota Senator Mike Rounds said he would approach it as an \"employer-employee issue\".\n\nKimmel has not publicly commented about his suspension, but his late-night colleagues - including Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert - responded on Thursday with a show of solidarity.\n\nKirk was fatally shot on 10 September during an open-air event on a Utah college campus.\n\nThe motive behind Charlie Kirk's killing: What we know and don't know\n\nOn Thursday, the Senate passed a resolution to designate 14 October - Kirk's birthday - a day of remembrance for him.\n\nLawmakers in the US House of Representatives approved the resolution, but nearly 100 Democrats opposed it.\n\nIn Sacramento, California, police said three shots were fired on Friday afternoon into a window of an ABC10 building while people were inside.\n\nThe shots came from a moving vehicle and nobody was injured, police said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the shooting was a targeted attack or an accidental discharge of a weapon.\n\nABC10 is an affiliate operated by Nexstar, one of the major media companies that cancelled Jimmy Kimmel Live! from its markets this week, citing the host's \"offensive and insensitive\" comments about Kirk."

        "text": "The federal prosecutor for the eastern district of Virginia resigned Friday under intense pressure from Donald Trump, after his office determined there wasn’t sufficient evidence to charge New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, a political rival of the president, with a crime.\n\nErik Siebert told colleagues he was resigning in a letter sent Friday, NBC News reported. Meanwhile, in an early Saturday post on his Truth Social platform, Trump maintained that Siebert didn’t quit – but rather: “I fired him!”\n\nHours earlier, Trump bluntly told reporters in the Oval Office: “I want him out.” The president claimed he soured on Siebert because Virginia’s two Democratic senators had endorsed his nomination, but also claimed that James “is very guilty of something”. ABC News reported earlier on Friday that Trump decided to fire Siebert after he failed to obtain an indictment against James.\n\nIn 2024, James filed a civil lawsuit against Trump and his company that resulted in a significant financial penalty. That penalty was thrown out in August by an appeals court that upheld a judge’s finding that Trump had engaged in fraud by exaggerating his wealth for decades.\n\nAfter a five-month investigation, officials did not find enough clear evidence to charge James with a crime, ABC News reported earlier this week. Trump nominated Siebert, who worked since 2010 as an assistant US attorney in that office, for the position in May.\n\nThe investigation centered on the allegation that James falsely said she was going to use a home she purchased in Virginia as her primary residence. While one document indicated James intended to use the home as her primary residence, others in the transaction show James clearly indicating she intended to use it as a second home.\n\nEd Martin, a former January 6 defendant lawyer who is leading the justice department effort to target Trump’s political rivals, pressured prosecutors to seek an indictment, according to ABC News. Bill Pulte, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and a staunch Trump ally, who criminally referred James, had urged Trump to fire Siebert, according to ABC.\n\nPulte also referred California senator Adam Schiff, another political rival of Trump, and the Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook for mortgage fraud. The allegations in both of those cases appear similarly thin.\n\nThe justice department has long held a level of independence from the White House, an arms length seen as necessary to give Americans confidence its prosecutors and other attorneys are making enforcement decisions based on facts and not politics. Trump has upended that norm, firing career attorneys and FBI agents who worked on January 6 cases."

        "article_summary": "During a contentious two-day testimony on Capitol Hill, House Judiciary ranking member Jamie Raskin accused the FBI of being complicit in a cover-up of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operations, highlighting the agency's ties to political loyalty under Trump. Patel, the FBI's witness, defended the agency's efforts to release Epstein-related files while facing intense questioning from Democrats and some Republicans regarding the transparency of investigations and the credibility of Epstein's victims. Despite a failed attempt to subpoena banks tied to Epstein, the issue remains a point of contention, with calls for greater accountability and disclosure from both sides of the aisle.",
        "source": "Politico - Congress",
        "text": "“Now we’re seeing one very clear reason why you want to build a political FBI: the Epstein files,” House Judiciary ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said Wednesday. “You want an FBI blindly loyal to Trump and to you as his enforcer so you can continue your cover-up of a massive international sex trafficking ring with more than 1,000 victims, betraying all of the survivors of the sexual violence.”\n\nRaskin’s comments came on the second of Patel’s two-day tour of Capitol Hill, which started Tuesday in the Senate Judiciary Committee before heading over to the House’s counterpart panel. In both venues, Patel advocated for the agency’s priorities.\n\nBut his 10 total hours of testimony were also marked by intense and hostile exchanges with Democrats, often related to the Epstein investigation. And his appearance Wednesday was interrupted by Democrats moving to subpoena four major banks in an effort to obtain Epstein’s financial records — a motion that failed by a single vote.\n\nOver the two days, Patel openly feuded with Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Adam Schiff, as well as Rep. Eric Swalwell; he appeared to relish the verbal sparring, which the White House’s rapid response feed quickly amplified. In one heated exchange with Swalwell, Patel said he would not recuse himself from any investigations into 60 people he once labeled “government gangsters” — including Swalwell.\n\n“I don’t give a damn what they say about me,” Patel said when Rep. Russell Fry (R-S.C.) asked him to respond to a Democratic fusillade.\n\nOn Epstein, Patel insisted the FBI is releasing as many files as possible but is hamstrung by court orders and a nearly 20-year-old deal struck between the Justice Department and Epstein that have impeded crucial avenues of investigation. He repeatedly noted that the Trump administration had released more Epstein-related files than its predecessors.\n\n“I’m not going to break the law to satisfy your curiosity,” Patel told Democrats, who in turn countered that the FBI director is misrepresenting his own power to publicly produce new materials judges have said is in the purview of the FBI and Justice Department.\n\nPatel heard from Republicans on the Epstein issue, too. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) joined Democrats in pressing Patel to release witness interview summaries during the House Judiciary hearing Wednesday. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Tuesday the FBI needs to move to release Epstein-related records.\n\n“The issue’s not gonna go away,” Kennedy said. “I think you’re gonna have to do more to satisfy the American people’s understandable curiosity in that regard.”\n\nHouse Democrats proved that point Wednesday, when they forced votes on issuing subpoenas for four banks that did business with Epstein and subsequently told regulators about $1.5 billion in suspicious transactions, as well as for the purposes of obtaining testimony from FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and records from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Bureau of Prisons Director William Marshall.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the only Republican to support Democrats in their attempts, which were squelched by Republicans. But failure Wednesday was not a foregone conclusion: In a House Oversight subcommittee in July, some Republicans helped push through Democratic subpoena efforts related to the Epstein files, which has resulted in the release of materials in the Justice Department’s possession.\n\nMassie is also not giving up on a separate attempt to force a House floor vote on the more comprehensive release of the Epstein files, and only needs one more signatory to proceed.\n\nThe issue has put all of Trump’s allies in an uncomfortable position, caught between their promises of transparency and realities of operating the country’s sprawling law enforcement agencies. Patel is no exception.\n\n“Is it your assertion that these victims aren’t credible?” Massie asked Patel Wednesday. “How can you sit here and in front of the Senate and say there are no names?”\n\nDemocrats also pressed Patel over and over again to explain his own personal reversal on the issue, as well as the bureau’s ongoing efforts to both disclose Epstein-related documents and continue to investigate his sex trafficking ring.\n\nPressed by Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-N.Y.), Patel said he would consider opening an investigation into the Epstein estate over Trump’s claim that a suggestive letter in Epstein’s 50th-birthday book was forged.\n\n“Sure, I’ll do it,” Patel said."

The incident has heightened security preparations for the event, which is expected to attract a large crowd amid ongoing discussions about political violence and rhetoric following Kirk's assassination. Meanwhile, a progressive group has urged its members to avoid the memorial service to prevent potential confrontations.",

        "text": "​\n\nThe man detained Friday by the Secret Service at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, was armed with a gun and knife and was inside the facility, The Washington Post reported, citing a law enforcement official familiar with the matter.\n\nCharlie Kirk’s memorial service is scheduled to be held at the stadium on Sunday and is undergoing security preparations.\n\nSecret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told Fox News Digital on Saturday that the man was detained \"in the stadium, but it was prior to the setup of any secure perimeter.\"\n\nThe individual said to Secret Service agents that he was at the site to provide private security and presented \"inactive law enforcement credentials,\" the unnamed official added to the Post.\n\n“This guy is a former deputy sheriff out of Idaho. He came and identified himself with expired credentials,” a federal source familiar with the investigation told Fox News. “They are going through his background and trying to figure out what he was up to there.’\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service in coordination with local law enforcement in Glendale, Arizona, is investigating an individual who was observed exhibiting suspicious behavior at State Farm Stadium,\" Guglielmi said.\n\n\"The individual was approached by Secret Service and stated during the encounter that he was a member of law enforcement and that he was armed. The individual is not a member of authorized law enforcement working the event and is currently in custody,\" Guglielmi added.\n\nFox News' Matt Finn contributed to this report.\n\nConservative media watchdog Media Research Center called the New Yorker magazine a “cesspool of mediocre writers” after it published a column this week titled, \"Charlie Kirk and Tyler Robinson Came from the Same Warped Online Worlds.\"\n\n“The New Yorker magazine used to be a showcase for great writers. That was many years ago. More recently it has become a cesspool of mediocre writers striving with great urgency to promote their leftist agendas,” the MRC’s P.J. Gladnick wrote. “And the latest such example of a New Yorker writer crawling deep into the sewer came on Wednesday with this smear masquerading as a story by Kyle Chayka.”\n\nThe New Yorker column says, “According to an interview that Robinson’s grandmother gave to the Daily Mail, he grew up in a conservative family that staunchly supported Trump. He attended just one semester of college before dropping out. He was registered to vote in Utah but was unaffiliated with a party and did not vote in the 2024 Presidential election. Instead, he seems to have spent time in the corners of the internet where young men can become radicalized toward violence.”\n\nIt later adds, “No matter what political ideas Robinson may have harbored, he might ultimately be best understood as a participant in that warped online culture.”\n\nThe New Yorker article then says Kirk “leveraged a version of the same toxic online dynamics and algorithmic-attention sinkholes that can ensnare people like Robinson.”\n\n“He created a universe of content that his adherents could live within, complete with its own ideological memes. The kind of free speech and lively discourse that Kirk espoused involved spreading hateful conspiracy theories and misinformation,” Chayka wrote.\n\nGladnick argued, “Ostensibly comparing Charlie Kirk with his assassin appears to have just been a cover for Chayka's true motive: to lash out at Kirk.”\n\n​\n\n\"Real Time\" host Bill Maher called out Hollywood liberals Friday for not acknowledging the Sept. 10 assassination of Charlie Kirk at the Emmys.\n\n\"The left does have this bad attitude of go no contact,\" Maher said during a panel discussion. \"I mean, at the Emmys, would it have killed someone to get up there, since they all want to talk about their politics, would it kill somebody to get up there- not give a speech about how much they liked Charlie Kirk, just to say, 'We had a political assassination this week. And that's wrong.' They would have been booed off the stage because he was on the wrong team. So you're not even allowed to say that.\"\n\n\"Could you imagine if a left-wing person was assassinated that week? The whole show would have been about that,\" Maher added.\n\nSunday's 77th Primetime Emmy Awards made no reference to the horrific murder of the Turning Point USA co-founder, which occurred just days before television's big night. Emmy host Nate Bargatze previously said he planned to avoid political topics during his stint.\n\n\"I know there's heartbreaking stuff that's been happening right now, but I want this night to be an escape, and I think that's why I was brought on,\" he told Entertainment Weekly on Thursday.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Saturday that former President Barack Obama has “no clue what he is talking about” regarding a claim he made in the wake of Jimmy Kimmel’s cancellation.\n\n“After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn’t like,” Obama wrote on X on Thursday after Kimmel’s show was shelved by ABC.\n\nKimmel's show was pulled over his comments about alleged Charlie Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson.\n\n\"With all due respect to former President Obama, he has no idea what he is talking about. The decision to fire Jimmy Kimmel and to cancel his show came from executives at ABC. That has now been reported,” Leavitt said.\n\n“And I can assure you it did not come from the White House and there was no pressure given from the president of the United States. How do I know that? Because I was with the president of the United States when this news broke in the United Kingdom. We were enjoying the beautiful and spectacular state visit that was put forth by the Royal Family and the prime minister of the U.K., Keir Starmer,” Leavitt continued.\n\n“And I actually brought this news to President Trump's attention, he had no idea this was happening. It was a decision that was made by ABC because Jimmy Kimmel chose to knowingly lie to his audience on his program about the death of a highly-respected man when our country is in a state of mourning. That was a decision that he made and he is now facing a consequence for that decision and for that lie,” Leavitt also said, noting, \"Jimmy Kimmel's ratings are in the gutter and this was probably also a business decision on behalf of ABC.\"\n\nFox News Digital's Stephanie Giang-Paunon contributed to this report.\n\n​\n\nIn the aftermath of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, a debate about political rhetoric and its impact on recent spates of political violence has taken hold on Capitol Hill and across the country.\n\nWhile both Republicans and Democrats have condemned political violence of all kinds, their views vary on how much inflammatory political rhetoric plays a role. Some Republicans have accused the left's rhetoric of fostering an \"assassination culture\" on the left, while Democrats have accused Republicans of attacks on free speech.\n\nOne member of Congress, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., attempted to steer the conversation towards gun control as opposed to rhetoric as the cause for the increase in political violence.\n\n\"This isn't just about what happened to Charlie Kirk. At the same time his tragic killing was happening, three kids were getting shot in school, and that was one or two weeks after another couple of kids were getting shot, in church, at mass, at a Catholic school,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nBut GOP firebrand Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., did not mince words about those who continue to foment hatred for conservatives with inflammatory rhetoric.\n\n\"We need to shame these people out of polite society, shame them out of existence. They need to be fired from their jobs. They are putting lives in danger,\" Mace said. \"They are denying that they're celebrating the political assassination and murder of Charlie Kirk, but they're liars. They're lying through their teeth.\"\n\nLawmakers from both sides of the aisle have called on others to \"turn down the heat\" in the wake of Kirk's assassination.\n\n​\n\nAs security preparations intensify for Charlie Kirk’s memorial service in Arizona, a former NYPD detective and security consultant warns mourners to remain alert.\n\n\"Pull your face out of your phone, put it in your pocket. Pay attention,\" Pat Brosnan urged.\n\nThe memorial, set for this weekend at State Farm Stadium, is expected to draw an enormous crowd. Officials estimate that more than 100,000 people may gather in and around the venue, including attendees inside the 63,000-seat stadium and overflow areas outside.\n\n\"From the moment you arrive… have your eyes wide open… who's to your right, who's to your left, who's behind you? What are they doing?\" Brosnan told Fox News Digital. \"Eyes in the backs and the sides of your head.\"\n\nAccording to a law enforcement bulletin obtained by ABC News, authorities are \"tracking several threats of unknown credibility.\"\n\n\"Violent extremists and unaffiliated lone offenders may view the memorial service or related events as attractive attack targets due to the attendance of these individuals, other senior U.S. government officials, state and local government officials, and political activists and due to major international media attention,\" the memo reportedly says.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has designated Kirk’s memorial service a Level 1 Special Event, the highest possible rating, matching Super Bowl-level security planning.\n\nCNN commentator Van Jones revealed that Charlie Kirk invited him to come onto his show the day before he was assassinated at Utah Valley University.\n\nThe outreach came as both Jones and Kirk gave differing opinions in reaction to the killing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska, who was fatally stabbed in the neck on a light rail train in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Aug. 22. The suspect was identified as Decarlos Brown.\n\n“Hey, Van, I mean it, I’d love to have you on my show to have a respectful conversation about crime and race. I would be a gentleman as I know you would be as well. We can disagree about the issues agreeably,” Jones said Kirk wrote to him in a private message on X.\n\nJones said before he could respond, Kirk was assassinated.\n\nThousands are showing up coast to coast for memorials and vigils honoring the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nAn estimated 1,500 to 2,000 people attended a candlelight vigil on Thursday at Soldiers Field in Rochester, Minnesota, according to the Rochester Post Bulletin.\n\n“We’re here to honor Charlie Kirk and all victims taken by cowardly acts of violence, regardless of who they are, what they believe and what they stand for,” Brad Trahan, a Rochester resident and organizer of the event, told the newspaper. “We come together to dedicate ourselves to peace. Charlie’s life symbolized dialogue, peace, faith and that goodwill will always supersede evil.”\n\nThe day before, around 200 people gathered for an event on the campus of California State University, Fresno, to pay tribute to Kirk, KFSN reported.\n\nImages also captured mourners attending vigils in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, and Newark, Delaware, among other events.\n\n​\n\nAn armed man who claimed to be connected to law enforcement was detained Friday at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, the Secret Service told Fox News Digital.\n\nThe NFL stadium will host Charlie Kirk’s memorial service on Sunday, Sept. 21.\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service in coordination with local law enforcement in Glendale, Arizona, is investigating an individual who was observed exhibiting suspicious behavior at State Farm Stadium,\" Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi told Fox News Digital on Saturday.\n\n\"The individual was approached by Secret Service and stated during the encounter that he was a member of law enforcement and that he was armed. The individual is not a member of authorized law enforcement working the event and is currently in custody,\" Guglielmi added.\n\nThe individual, who has not been publicly identified, actually was armed, Guglielmi confirmed to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"The U.S. Secret Service and local law enforcement are investigating the circumstances as to why he was at the location,\" he also said.\n\n\"This guy is a former deputy sheriff out of Idaho. He came and identified himself with expired credentials. They are going through his background and trying to figure out what he was up to there,\" a federal source familiar with the investigation told Fox News.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance are among the speakers set to honor Kirk on Sunday at the event.\n\nFox News' Matt Finn contributed to this report.\n\nAn Arizona-based chapter of the progressive group Indivisible is asking its members to stay home Sunday when Charlie Kirk’s memorial service takes place in Glendale.\n\n“We believe strongly in the right to protest and speak out, but we also know there are moments where restraint protects both our community and our democracy,” Brent Peak, co-chair of Northwest Valley Indivisible, said in a statement. “This is one of those moments.”\n\n“We urge our members and the broader community to choose safety and solidarity over confrontation at this event,” Peak added. “Our commitment to democracy and free speech remains strong, but we will not allow ourselves to be used as props in someone else’s attempt to stir violence.”\n\nOn its website, Indivisible describes itself as a “movement of thousands of group leaders and more than a million members taking regular, iterative, and increasingly complex actions to resist the GOPs agenda, elect local champions, and fight for progressive policies.”"

        "article_summary": "In her new memoir, Kamala Harris critiques several prominent Democrats, including California Governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, for their initial hesitance to endorse her following Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race. She also expresses her concerns about Biden's ability to campaign effectively due to his age and criticizes his inner circle for sidelining her and failing to defend her against negative narratives. Additionally, Harris reflects on her decision-making regarding potential vice presidential picks, revealing her apprehensions about selecting candidates like Pete Buttigieg and Josh Shapiro.",
        "source": "Politico",
        "text": "Here are eight Democrats Harris calls out in her new memoir:\n\nGavin Newsom\n\nThe California governor, and Harris’ longtime friend and competitor in their home state, was among the Democrats the former vice president exposed for their response in the hours after Biden dropped out of the race.\n\n“Hiking. Will call back,” Harris wrote of Newsom’s response in notes from her calls that day.\n\n“He never did,” she pointedly added in her memoir, skipping reference to Newsom’s subsequent endorsement hours later.\n\nA spokesperson for Newsom previously declined to comment to POLITICO on the anecdote.\n\nHarris and Newsom, both natives of the Bay Area , have had long and oftentimes overlapping political careers. While Harris, up until her book tour, has largely faded from view after her failed presidential bid, Newsom’s popularity has grown among Democratic voters, especially after the White House sent National Guard troops to the Golden State.\n\nThe California governor has come increasingly in the spotlight as one of the few Democratic voices willing to match Trump’s preferred tough-talking form of public sparring.\n\nGretchen Whitmer\n\nNewsom wasn’t the only Democrat whose response the vice president described as lukewarm.\n\nIn her memoir, Harris recounted Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s reticence to commit to an endorsement. According to Harris, Whitmer said she needed to “let the dust settle” following Biden’s withdrawal from the race before making a public statement.\n\nWhitmer, whose name had been floated at the time as a possible Democratic candidate to replace Biden, endorsed Harris the following day — and announced that she would co-chair Harris’ presidential campaign.\n\nA spokesperson for the governor declined to comment on the record.\n\nJB Pritzker\n\nAccording to her call notes from the day of Biden’s withdrawal, which Harris presented in an italicized list in the early pages of her memoir, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker also declined to immediately offer an immediate endorsement.\n\n“As governor of Illinois, I’m the convention host,” Harris described as Pritzker’s response. “I can’t commit.”\n\nPritzker endorsed Harris the day after Biden dropped out.\n\n“Gov. Pritzker fought hard to elect Vice President Harris and Democrats across the state and country,” said a spokesperson for the governor. “He’s proud to have helped lead a convention that built momentum and showcased the Harris-Walz ticket.”\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nIn a shocking dig at the former Transportation secretary, whom Harris described as a “close friend,” Harris wrote that while Buttigieg was her top pick to join her on the presidential ticket, she ultimately didn’t select him because she didn’t believe America was ready for a Black woman and a gay man in the White House.\n\n“We were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man. Part of me wanted to say, Screw it, let’s just do it. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk,” Harris wrote, adding that “I think Pete also knew that — to our mutual sadness.”\n\nBut according to Buttigieg, Harris’ concerns were “not something that we ever talked about.”\n\nThe former Transportation secretary told POLITICO on Thursday that he was “surprised” to read Harris’ thought process on his potential vice presidential candidacy in an excerpt of her book published this week, saying he believes in “giving Americans more credit” than assuming they wouldn’t vote for both of them.\n\nJosh Shapiro\n\nShapiro, who was also in the running to be Harris’ No. 2, didn’t make the cut either.\n\nHarris was concerned that the Pennsylvania governor’s ambition would prove an obstacle to his willingness to serve in a secondary role to hers.\n\nShapiro “mused that he would want to be in the room for every decision,” Harris recalled in the memoir, writing that she responded bluntly that “a vice president is not a copresident.”\n\nShe just couldn’t trust that he would settle for a role as No. 2.\n\nAnd while Harris lauded Shapiro as “poised, polished and personable,” she said he “peppered” her and her staff with questions — including how many bedrooms were in the vice president’s home and “how he might arrange to get Pennsylvania artists’ work on loan from the Smithsonian.”\n\nShapiro also showed a “lack of discretion” in the process, Harris wrote, citing an incident when his car — with Pennsylvania plates — was filmed by CNN outside of her residence despite her staff’s efforts to secure the governor less obvious transportation.\n\nA spokesperson for Shapiro pushed back on Harris’ characterization of the governor, telling POLITICO this week that “it’s simply ridiculous to suggest that Governor Shapiro was focused on anything other than defeating Donald Trump and protecting Pennsylvania from the chaos we are living through now.”\n\nMark Kelly\n\nThe Arizona senator, a former astronaut and retired naval officer, was a strong contender in the veepstakes, Harris recalled, describing him as “magnetic” and saying that she “admired” him.\n\nBut while Kelly was an “American ideal of selfless service,” he was also “untarnished” politically. He had yet to weather an “‘oh shit’ moment,” Harris wrote, saying that she “wasn’t sure” how he would handle the kind of attacks Trump was likely to lob his way.\n\nHarris was also wary of the fact that Kelly was slow to sign the pro-labor PRO Act — a choice that she called a “red flag.”\n\nThe senator’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nAfter remaining quiet in the aftermath of her 2024 campaign, Harris finally opened the floodgates on her former boss, calling his decision to run for a second term “reckless.”\n\nThough she did not believe it was “incapacity,” Biden was old, Harris wrote. And it showed. At 81, the president was tired, manifesting in “physical and verbal stumbles,” Harris wrote.\n\n“I don’t think it’s any surprise that the debate debacle happened right after two back-to-back trips to Europe and a flight to the West Coast for a Hollywood fundraiser,” she said.\n\nA spokesperson for Biden previously declined to comment on her book, but several former aides were critical of previously published excerpts in interviews with POLITICO.\n\nBut while she did have “concerns” about Biden’s ability to lead a successful campaign, Harris emphasized that “there was a distinction between his ability to campaign and his ability to govern,” writing that he “navigated successfully through intensely dangerous world events.”\n\nHarris stressed that her relationship with Biden was a good one, describing their rapport as “genuine,” based on a foundation of shared values despite being people who “seemingly couldn’t have been more different.”\n\nStill, Harris describes the frustration that she and her husband, Doug, experienced feeling that she had to repeatedly prove her loyalty to the president.\n\n“I had to prove my loyalty, time and time again,” Harris wrote.\n\nBut Biden and his White House didn’t offer the same in return. When she was cast as a “DEI hire” or mocked for her laugh by conservatives, the White House stayed silent.\n\n“Getting anything positive said about my work or any defense against untrue attacks was almost impossible,” she wrote.\n\nShe also specifically mentioned that Biden called her before her crucial debate with Donald Trump in 2024 to inquire why she supposedly was critical of him to donors. The call rattled her, she wrote.\n\nBiden’s inner circle\n\nBut her broadsides weren’t just reserved for the former president.\n\nHarris directed a volley of criticisms at Biden’s inner circle, blaming them for pushing her to the side as her popularity grew in a series of moves that she said ultimately held her back from beating Trump.\n\nBiden’s team thrust thorny policy items onto her plate, reprimanding her after a viral speech she made and failed to defend her against attacks from Republicans and conservative media — even “adding fuel to negative narratives,” including reports of staff turnover in her office — Harris wrote.\n\nAnd perhaps most of all, Harris blamed Biden’s confidants for not pushing him to step aside sooner.\n\n“’It’s Joe and Jill’s decision.’ We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized,” Harris wrote."

        "text": "The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has been urged to cancel plans to be the guest of honour at an event hosted by the chief lobbyist of the gambling industry while the Treasury is in the midst of a review of taxes on the £12bn sector.\n\nReeves is slated to appear at a “private reception” for business leaders, organised by the corporate communications company Brunswick, at the forthcoming Labour party conference in Liverpool.\n\nAccording to an invitation seen by the Guardian, the event will be hosted by Michael Dugher, the chair of the Betting & Gaming Council (BGC), who joined Brunswick as a part-time “senior adviser” last year.\n\nDugher, a former Labour MP who stepped down during Jeremy Corbyn’s stint as party leader, has since built a career as a pugnacious and sometimes controversial champion of Britain’s gambling industry.\n\nHe recently told the BGC’s members, including online casinos and bookmakers, of his efforts to talk the Treasury out of plans to increase taxes on the sector to help fund the public finances.\n\nGambling companies could save billions of pounds if Reeves ignores calls to raise duties on online gambling, including from the former prime minister Gordon Brown.\n\nReeves and Dugher have a longstanding political and personal friendship stretching back to their teenage years.\n\nBut MPs and a parliamentary standards campaigner said the chancellor should refuse his invitation, questioning the “very strange timing”.\n\nThe former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the decision “raises real questions about the chancellor’s judgment and impartiality on this matter particularly when it is already widely known that she has taken both recent hospitality and donations from the sector”.\n\nReeves accepted three tickets to a musical worth £330, courtesy of the BGC in 2023 as well as £20,000 in donations from gambling executives while Labour was in opposition.\n\n“The chancellor should think long and hard about whether she should appear at this event,” said Daisy Cooper MP, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesperson.\n\n“Online gambling is one of the places where she should be looking to raise revenue for our public services. If she fails to do so at the budget she will have serious questions to answer over whether events like this one influenced her at all.\n\n“To show she cares about taxpayers more than big gambling firms the chancellor should commit to raising taxes on online gambling giants ahead of the budget.”\n\nBrunswick said Dugher’s role in the gambling industry was “completely separate” from his work for the public relations firm.\n\nThe debate over whether to raise taxes on gambling puts Dugher at the centre of a tug of war between leading Labour figures with whom he has longstanding ties.\n\nDugher was formerly a special adviser to Brown, who has called for taxes on online gambling to rise by as much as £3bn to help fund an end to the two-child benefit cap.\n\nBut Dugher also has a longstanding relationship with Reeves, with whom he claimed to have been “in touch” earlier this year during the BGC’s tax campaign, which included hosting a darts-themed event with the Paddy Power owner, Flutter.\n\nReeves said at the time that she had no formal meeting with the BGC and would not ever have discussed the tax changes.\n\nThe pair’s friendship stretches back to their teenage years, while they also once shared a parliamentary office in Westminster.\n\nThey will reunite for the Brunswick event on 28 September, weeks before Reeves announces her second budget as chancellor, at which any new taxes on online casinos could be revealed.\n\n“Very strange timing for such an event,” said Tom Brake, a former Liberal Democrat MP and director of Unlock Democracy, a campaign group that advocates for improved parliamentary standards.\n\nHe said Reeves “should have politely declined” the invitation, adding that her acceptance was the sort of thing that could be considered by a new standards body, the ethics and integrity commission, due to be established next month.\n\nA spokesperson for Brunswick said: “For many years Brunswick has hosted a reception at the Labour party conference which enables senior business leaders to engage with a number of ministers and MPs.\n\n“Michael is a part-time senior adviser to Brunswick, and his work with us is completely separate from his other roles. He will be hosting the event jointly alongside partners from Brunswick’s public affairs team.”\n\nThe Guardian approached the chancellor for comment."

        "article_summary": "During a House hearing, D.C. Councilmember Charles Allen White praised Eleanor Holmes Norton's political legacy but expressed concern about her current ability to effectively represent the District, suggesting that the city needs a more energetic leader. White, who is challenging Norton for her congressional seat, emphasized the urgency for strong representation as the District faces vulnerabilities, particularly in light of recent crime-related criticisms from Republican lawmakers. Norton is already facing a primary challenge, and her future in the race remains uncertain as local officials navigate the pressures of the current political climate.",
        "source": "Politico - Congress",
        "text": "White, who was attending the House hearing, praised Norton’s political legacy in a brief interview. But, he added, “like most people in D.C., we recognize that she can’t do the things that she once did.”\n\n“Right now, the District is vulnerable, and we’re losing ground,” White continued, “and with only one elected member in this entire Congress, we need somebody with the fight, the energy, and the know-how.”\n\nNorton is already facing a primary challenge from former DNC official Kinney Zalesne, and additional candidates are expected to enter the race if Norton steps aside. But White is the first credible opponent with a citywide political profile to challenge Norton since she was first elected in 1990.\n\nNorton’s congressional office and campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhite has occupied the progressive lane in city politics, staking out political ground to the left of Mayor Muriel Bowser, whom he challenged in the 2022 Democratic primary. White, who serves in a citywide at-large seat, fell just over 10,000 votes short in a four-person field and had been widely seen as likely to launch another mayoral campaign in 2026.\n\nWhite sat in the back row of the Capitol Hill hearing room during the four-plus-hour House Oversight hearing with D.C.’s top elected officials: Bowser — who called Norton as “mighty warrior” in her prepared testimony — as well as D.C. Council Chair Phil Mendelson and D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb.\n\nNorton, during her questioning time, defended the District’s right to self-government and asked the three officials to weigh in on why the city deserved statehood.\n\nMost Republicans, however, pressed the city officials on their handling of crime in the District. GOP lawmakers have joined Trump in painting an image of the nation’s capital as rife with crime to justify an August presidential order commandeering the city police and flooding federal agents and National Guard troops into the city.\n\nAs local officials came under siege from Republicans on the Oversight panel, Norton sat silent at her dais. She entered and left the hearing room several times flanked by an aide, sometimes appearing to lean on the person for support.\n\nSpeaking outside the hearing room, White said that he had informed Norton of his intention to run for her seat, although he declined to detail Norton’s response in what he called a private conversation.\n\n“We in the District who love the congresswoman and respect the work that she’s done — we know that she can’t fight the fight that we need right now,” White said, adding that he had met with 30 congressional offices since the presidential enforcement surge to discuss the need for a nationwide fight on behalf of the city.\n\nHe struck similar themes in a launch video he posted shortly after the hearing ended: “We need our best fighters right now,” White said. “I’m ready to take this torch.”\n\nThat message largely echoes what Norton’s longtime adviser Donna Brazile wrote in a Washington Post op-ed this week urging her not to run. Norton, Brazile wrote, “is no longer the dynamo she once was, at a time when D.C. needs the kind of energetic representation in Congress she provided for decades.”\n\nAsked after the hearing if she supported another term for Norton, Bowser said, “I don’t believe she’s filed for re-election.”\n\nMendelson also sidestepped the question, telling reporters, “Eleanor Holmes Norton has done a lot for the District over the years, and I respect her, and I’m going to leave it at that.”"

        "text": "NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nFailed Democrat presidential candidate and former Vice President Kamala Harris admitted to having reservations over transgender athletes competing in women's sports in her new book.\n\nIn the book \"107 Days,\" Harris wrote that she \"agrees\" with the concerns of parents and athletes who oppose letting males compete with females.\n\n\"I agree with the concerns expressed by parents and players that we have to take into account biological factors such as muscle mass and unfair student athletic advantage when we determine who plays on which teams, especially in contact sports,\" Harris wrote, per Politico. \"With goodwill and common sense, I believe we can come up with ways to do this, without vilifying and demonizing children.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nHarris never addressed the topic directly during her campaign, as the issue went on to be one of the more influential factors in the election.\n\nHarris wrote she wouldn't turn against transgender people, and argued President Donald Trump \"was painting a bull’s-eye on their backs and putting them in peril.\"\n\n\"This is a community with which I have a deep connection,\" she wrote. \"There was no way I was going to go against my very nature and turn on transgender people.\"\n\nTrump's campaign ad with the slogan \"Kamala is for they/them, Donald Trump is for you,\" was hailed as the most effective message of the 2024 election. It highlighted the Democrats' position of enabling biological males in women's sports.\n\nHarris admitted in her book that her campaign should have \"given even more attention to how we might mitigate Trump’s attacks,\" regarding that message.\n\nINSIDE GAVIN NEWSOM'S TRANSGENDER VOLLEYBALL CRISIS\n\nThe most notable instance of Harris addressing her record on transgender issues came during her interview with Bret Baier on Fox News in October. When Baier pressed Harris on her past support of tax-payer-funded gender transition surgeries for prisoners, Harris shied away from taking a stance and called it a \"remote issue.\"\n\nStill, the topic of trans athletes in women's sports may have haunted Harris on election day, according to data.\n\nA national exit poll conducted by the Concerned Women for America (CWA) legislative action committee found that 70% of moderate voters saw the issue of \"Donald Trump’s opposition to transgender boys and men playing girls' and women’s sports and of transgender boys and men using girls' and women’s bathrooms,\" as important to them. And 6% said it was the most important issue of all, while 44% said it was \"very important.\"\n\nSince the election, many key Democrats have distanced themselves from outwardly supporting trans athletes in women's sports.\n\nMeanwhile, a report by the New York Times suggests that former President Joe Biden himself did not agree with trans athletes participating in women's and girls' sports.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"According to a number of former Biden-administration officials, there remained a simmering debate inside the administration about whether those Title IX protections should extend to sports,\" the Times reported, saying that \"one side…maintained that there was no legal difference between letting trans students use bathrooms that align with their gender identity and letting trans student athletes play on sports teams that align with their gender identity.\"\n\nHowever, Biden was \"on the other side…who believed that the competitive, zero-sum nature of sports made them different from bathrooms — that some transgender athletes would enjoy unfair physical advantages over women.\n\n\"Most important, one of the officials holding this view was Biden himself,\" the Times wrote.\n\nThe Times received a quote from a former Biden administration official who said Biden was \"particularly focused on the competition issue.\""

Social media videos show bodies trapped under rubble and debris.\n\nRSF has not commented on the incident. The paramilitary group has been engaged in a raging civil war with the Sudanese Armed Forces since April 2023 but since the army’s capture of the capital, Khartoum, in March, the RSF has been fighting to maintain territorial dominance of Darfur, its stronghold.\n\nEl Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, is the last remaining capital in the region controlled by the Sudanese army and has been under siege for more than a year.\n\nResearch from Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab shows RSF is building an earthen wall around El Fasher to trap people inside.\n\nSatellite imagery released by the lab on Thursday showed RSF forces advancing in many areas, including around the Abu Shouk camp and the former peacekeeping base for United Nations-African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur (Unamid), now used by anti-RSF joint forces.\n\nThe city and the camp have been under an intensifying assault in recent months, experiencing artillery shelling and drone strikes.\n\nBrutal attacks there killed at least 89 civilians over a 10-day period last month, with the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR) saying some appeared to have been summary executions.\n\nLast week, at least 13 people were killed in shelling of the city by RSF.\n\nA new report by the OHCHR said at least 3,384 civilians were killed between January and June, mostly in Darfur – a figure representing nearly 80% of civilian casualties in Sudan last year.\n\nMost of the killings were caused by artillery shelling and air and drone strikes in densely populated areas, and many deaths happened during the RSF’s offensive on El Fasher as well as the Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps in April, the report said.\n\nThe UN and rights groups have in the past reported that some killings have been ethnically targeted.\n\nEl Fasher is under a communications blackout, making it difficult to verify casualties or coordinate aid. At a briefing on Tuesday on the situation in the city organised by Avaaz, an advocacy group, participants talked of dire and deteriorating conditions in the city due to the assaults.\n\nFatima, an artist and lecturer who works with displaced communities in North Darfur, said civilians in El Fasher were enduring deliberate shelling, rapid deaths, slow deaths, injuries, starvation, disease, intimidation and other inhumane practices daily. “This is a real catastrophe,” she said.\n\nMohammad Duda, spokesperson of Zamzam camp in North Darfur, said people in El Fasher were “being forced to hide in buried shipping containers as makeshift shelters”. He appealed to the international community “to intervene immediately and save the people of El Fasher from this catastrophic humanitarian crisis”.\n\nAvaaz expressed concern that if El Fasher fell, RSF could carry out ethnically targeted attacks, as reported afer the capture of Zamzam this year and in Geneina in 2023."

Former Democratic officials, including Pete Buttigieg's team, are adapting their strategies to engage directly with voters through YouTube, showcasing its growing influence among younger and disengaged voters. As politicians like Adam Schiff gain substantial followings on the platform, both parties recognize the need to build their own audiences and leverage YouTube's reach to connect with constituents more effectively.",
        "source": "Politico",
        "text": "Taken together, it signals the arrival of a fast-changing attention economy that has scrambled what effective political communication looks like. The 2028 cycle has the potential to be the first post-cable TV election, heralding the dawn of a post-literate era in which technology fully displaces reading and consumption of news from traditional outlets.\n\n“I think there are a lot of elected officials and their staff who are realizing that their viewers are not necessarily just on cable news, and if they want to reach more people, more diverse audiences, they really have to diversify where they’re talking,” said Emily Keller, a former Democratic National Committee social media director who now works with Democratic officials as a strategic partner manager for YouTube.\n\nIn this, Buttigieg’s thinking is instructive. In the past, his team turned to YouTube mainly to share clips from his media appearances. Their thinking is different now. “Looking ahead, we see the channel evolving into a destination of its own,” Chris Meagher, a Buttigieg spokesperson, told POLITICO. Meagher went on to describe the platform as “a place for Pete to connect in a direct and unfiltered way with millions of Americans.” (One example: Buttigieg recently spoke to a rural health care provider about the impact of President Donald Trump’s budget cuts.)\n\nThe landscape has fundamentally changed since 2016, which some political observers memorably (and incorrectly) predicted would be the “Meerkat election.” That was a passing fad. But the switch to YouTube has staying power.\n\nJust last week, YouTube hosted what it trumpeted as its “first-ever exclusive, global broadcast of an NFL game.” C-SPAN has landed there, too. Young men and disaffected voters are also flocking to the platform for their news.\n\n“YouTube by far represents the broadest reach potential of any platform, especially among younger audiences and disengaged voters,” Meagher told POLITICO.\n\nYouTube says this is a boom time for politicians on the platform. “We’re seeing really significant growth in ways that I would not expect in an off year,” said Carly Eason, a former Republican National Committee official who works as Keller’s counterpart, focusing on YouTube’s outreach to GOP figures. “As they really invest in their channels, work on their channels, and follow a lot of YouTube best practices, they’re really reaping the rewards.”\n\nYouTube views are surging among both Republicans and Democrats. “Verdict with Ted Cruz” has some 331,000 subscribers. His top video — an interview with Elon Musk — has garnered 1.2 million views. “This Is Gavin Newsom,” hosted by the California governor, has 187,000 subscribers. Beshear, the Kentucky governor, has a series of videos called “Andy Unplugged: The Lighter Side of Leadership,” in which he has taken on the drive-thru at Wonder Whip, shown off Churchill Downs and watched the 2024 solar eclipse.\n\nOther political leaders have taken a different approach to YouTube’s rising influence, primarily focusing on outreach to existing creators on the platform. Rep. Ro Khanna’s (D-Calif.) recent push to improve child safety on Roblox, the online gaming platform, garnered more than 50 million views across 18 videos on other creators’ channels, said Marie Baldassarre, Khanna’s senior communications adviser.\n\nThat’s a deliberate choice.\n\n“Our strategy with influencers, right-wing creators and non-political voices is reaching hundreds of thousands of first-time voters and letting them know that Democrats aren’t so bad after all,” Baldassarre told POLITICO.\n\nIt’s not just potential 2028 candidates who are flocking to the platform.\n\nMore broadly, politicians are recognizing they need to build their own audiences. At 92, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) — who, decades ago, was the first senator to adopt the fax machine — is kicking the tires on doing more podcasts, Eason said.\n\nFew Democrats have done so well on YouTube as Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). He began the year with 24,000 subscribers and now has nearly half a million. His straight-to-the-camera videos perform well.\n\n“The nice thing about building up a following on YouTube is that it puts my content in front of people who aren’t necessarily looking for it,” Schiff told POLITICO in an interview.\n\nNot long ago, amid his YouTube experiment earlier this year, Schiff said a waiter at a restaurant complimented him on his “show.” He thought the person must’ve been referring to an appearance on MSNBC or another media hit. He thanked the man and then pressed further.\n\n“He looked at me somewhat surprised, and he said, ‘Your show on YouTube,’” Schiff said. “And I thought to myself, ‘Wow, I’ve got a show.’ And now you know that we’re closing in on 500,000 subscribers, that really is like the following of a cable news show.”\n\nSchiff said his party still has work to do in checking Republicans’ rise on alternative platforms.\n\n“We as a party still have a lot more catching up to do in the digital realm, both in terms of the different platforms, but also with digital and social media influencers,” Schiff said.\n\n“The best time for Democrats to care about YouTube was 2018,” Stefan Smith, a Democratic digital strategist, told POLITICO. “The second-best time is now.”\n\nJessica Piper contributed to this report."

In a new A&E docuseries, he discusses the changing landscape of celebrity privacy and the impact of technology on the adult entertainment industry, stating that many celebrities now use platforms to control their own narratives rather than fear leaks. Blatt expresses that the era of traditional sex tapes is over, as privacy laws and accessible platforms have changed how individuals engage with adult content.",

        "text": "OnlyFans has killed Kevin Blatt’s career.\n\nThe celebrity sex tape broker, who infamously promoted the intimate recordings of Paris Hilton in the early 2000s, believes the subscription-based platform makes it easier for celebrities to sleep at night without fear of leaks.\n\n\"There just isn’t that potential to make any money, not the way that we used to,\" Blatt told Fox News Digital. \"It’s a different day and age now. The technology’s changed it all. With sites like OnlyFans, you could put up your own content. … Now you put out a sex tape just to become a blip on the radar for TMZ or the national news to talk about.\"\n\nCHARLIE SHEEN OPENS UP ABOUT SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS WITH MEN FOR THE FIRST TIME\n\nBlatt is speaking out in a new A&E docuseries, \"Secrets of Celebrity Sex Tapes.\" The show offers an in-depth look at how racy footage ignited public obsession, sparked outrage and impacted the lives of those involved. It features the stories of celebrities like Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, as well as Kim Kardashian, Colin Farrell and Farrah Abraham, among others.\n\nBlatt admitted he hesitated to come forward about his adult entertainment past.\n\n\"I’m very cautious of the media because you never know how they’re going to portray you,\" said Blatt.\n\n\"But look, sex tapes, as we know them, are over. The business model’s over. There’s no way of profiting from them anymore unless people contact me to take them off the market. That’s what I do a lot these days — help people take down videos and information off the internet. But the bottom line is you can’t make money because of the privacy laws that are in place and the platforms that are readily accessible.\"\n\n\"I think the public is smart enough to know that a lot of these celebrities are promoting themselves or using platforms like OnlyFans to attract more attention,\" he added.\n\nOver the years, OnlyFans has become known as a place where sex workers can get paid more safely and stars can directly interact with fans on their terms.\n\nWATCH: DONNA D’ERRICO CLEARS UP BIGGEST ONLYFANS MISCONCEPTION\n\nMany sex workers joined OnlyFans during the pandemic when in-person venues shut down or became more dangerous because of COVID-19, the Associated Press reported. According to the outlet, the site has been tremendously lucrative for some people, allowing them to earn thousands of dollars each month.\n\nAs of late 2024, OnlyFans reported having about 377.5 million user and subscriber accounts, according to Business Insider. The outlet also reported that creators of the platform earned $6.63 billion in 2023.\n\n\"Sex tapes? Those days are over,\" Blatt stressed. \"… Some people don’t realize you can’t really profit from them. … Many folks benefit from putting themselves up on a site like OnlyFans instead of having to market through an adult company.\"\n\n\"… The future of the business is really you being able to be your own network and syndicate your own stuff via any platform where you can submit user-generated content,\" he added.\n\nIn 2021, OnlyFans announced it had suspended a plan to ban sexually explicit content following an outcry from its creators.\n\nAdvocates for sex workers had criticized the planned ban, arguing that it would push people into more dangerous street-based work. They said taking away a safer virtual space and cutting people’s income makes them more vulnerable to the risk of being trafficked, the Associated Press reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nBlatt claimed that celebrities now shouldn’t worry about a sex tape being sold.\n\n\"As you’ll see in the docuseries, I talk about the legalities of it … But honestly, should they be worried? No.\"\n\nBut the damage from past leaks has been lasting. In her 2023 memoir, Hilton shed new light on her 2003 tape with then-boyfriend Rick Salomon.\n\n\"I don't remember that much about the night he wanted to make a videotape while we made love,\" wrote the hotel heiress, as quoted by The Times of London. \"He had often said it was something he did with other women, but I felt weird and uncomfortable about it. I always told him, ‘I can’t. It’s too embarrassing.’ He kept pushing. I kept making excuses.\"\n\n\"He told me if I wouldn't do it, he could easily find someone who would,\" the mom of two wrote. \"That was the worst thing I could think of — to be dumped by this grown man because I was a stupid kid who didn't know how to play grown-up games.\"\n\n\"… I had to drink myself silly. Quaaludes helped. But I did it. I have to own that. I knew what he wanted, and I went with it.\"\n\nWhat should have been a private moment between two people was released to the public. As Hilton struggled with her sexuality, the footage spread quickly. Looking back, the now-44-year-old believed that her life \"was over\" and the career she envisioned for herself wasn’t possible. She felt violated.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

They said 'whore.'\"\n\nWhen asked if there was ever a point in his career where he felt that he had gone too far, Blatt responded that since then, \"I've turned my skillset from putting things out to taking things off the market.\"\n\n\"I had an epiphany at one point,\" he said. \"Not only were a lot of these people thrown into a situation they didn’t ask for, but [now], I like to help people out. There was never a point where I thought what I was doing was horrible or going to ruin somebody’s life.\n\n\"And to be honest with you … I don’t believe that any of these sex tapes have really harmed anybody’s career. They’ve only enhanced people’s careers and put them back in the zeitgeist. There have been a lot of people who got shows, cameos and movies as a result of becoming popular on TMZ because of the sex tape. … Some people think I’m an extortionist.

The Indian IT trade body Nasscom criticized the abrupt implementation of the fee, stating it could negatively impact ongoing projects and create uncertainty for businesses and professionals. The policy, aimed at ensuring only highly skilled workers are sponsored, may also affect the US's competitive edge in the tech sector and could lead companies to relocate work overseas.",
        "source": "AlJazeera",
        "text": "India says the Trump administration’s move to implement a new $100,000 annual fee on H-1B worker visas in the United States is likely to have humanitarian consequences, warning of “potential disruptions for families” affected by the policy.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, India’s foreign ministry said New Delhi hopes the disruptions can be “addressed suitably” by the authorities in the US, adding that the full implications of the policy are being studied by the government.\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nlist of 4 items\n\nlist 1 of 4Trump imposes $100,000 fee per year for H-1B visas\n\nlist 2 of 4What are H-1B visas and how might the Trump administration change them?\n\nlist 3 of 4US-India relations hit new low despite Trump-Modi bromance: What’s next?\n\nlist 4 of 4South Korea questions $350bn investment drive amid US immigration crackdown\n\nend of list\n\nH-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills – such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers – to work in the US, initially for three years, but extendable to six years.\n\nIndia was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 percent of approved beneficiaries.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, India’s leading trade body Nasscom said the one-day timeline for implementing the H-1B visa fee was a matter of “concern”.\n\nNasscom, representing India’s $283bn IT and business process outsourcing industry, said the policy’s abrupt rollout would affect Indian nationals and disrupt continuity of ongoing onshore projects for the country’s technology services firms.\n\n“A one-day deadline creates considerable uncertainty for businesses, professionals, and students across the world,” Nasscom said in a statement, a day after US President Donald Trump announced the fee, which comes into force from Sunday.\n\nThe new H-1B measure, which will likely face legal challenges, was announced alongside the introduction of a $1m “gold card” US residency programme.\n\nNasscom said the new policy could have “ripple effects” on the US innovation ecosystem and global job markets, pointing out that for companies, “additional cost will require adjustments”.\n\nNasscom added that policy changes of this scale were best “introduced with adequate transition periods, allowing organisations and individuals to plan effectively and minimize disruption”.\n\nUS officials on Friday said the change to the H-1B programme would ensure that companies would only sponsor workers with the most rarefied skill sets. However, such a prohibitive fee will likely vastly transform the H-1B system, which was created in 1990 and awards 85,000 visas per year on a lottery system.\n\nSupporters of the H-1B programme say it brings the best and brightest to work in the US, creating an edge against foreign competitors. Critics have long charged that companies have abused the programme, using it to pay lower wages and to impose fewer labour protections.\n\nTech entrepreneurs – including Trump’s former ally Elon Musk – have warned against targeting H-1B visas, saying that the US does not have enough homegrown talent to fill important tech sector job vacancies.\n\nHowever, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said: “All the big companies are on board.”\n\nGeographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers, according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nSome analysts suggested the fee may force companies to move some high-value work overseas, hampering the US’s position in the high-stakes artificial intelligence race with China, which at 11.7 percent of total H-1B visas ranks a distant second, according to government data.\n\nFollowing the White House’s announcement, major US tech firms Microsoft, JPMorgan and Amazon advised employees holding H-1B visas to remain in the US, according to internal emails reviewed by the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe new fee marks the Trump administration’s most high-profile attempt to overhaul the country’s temporary employment visa system. Since taking office in January, he has launched a broad crackdown on immigration, including efforts to limit certain forms of undocumented immigration.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea’s foreign ministry on Saturday said its officials would “comprehensively assess the impact of these measures on the advancement of [South Korean] companies and professional talents into the US market and engage in necessary communication with the US”.\n\nHundreds of South Koreans were detained during a US immigration raid on a Hyundai-LG battery factory site in the state of Georgia this month."

The agreement is part of ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and China amid trade tensions, with U.S. companies like Oracle looking to acquire stakes in TikTok's U.S. operations to comply with regulatory requirements.

        "text": "Donald Trump said on Friday that he and Xi Jinping had agreed to approve a deal over TikTok.\n\n“He approved the TikTok deal,” Trump said about Xi to reporters in the Oval Office, suggesting the leaders signed off on a preliminary agreement. But Trump offered no details about the agreement or when it would be signed.\n\nThe American and Chinese leaders had connected over a phone call earlier in the day, the first direct contact between the two leaders since June. China and the US have been at loggerheads over trade negotiations and the future of TikTok, a Chinese-owned social media platform that faces a ban in the US.\n\nTrump had said earlier this week that Washington and Beijing had agreed a deal on TikTok under which it would be transferred to US control, but details of the framework have been scant, and elements reportedly remain to be hashed out. Investors including the US software giant Oracle have been in talks to take a large stake in TikTok’s US operations, which would dilute the amount of China-based ownership to comply with a law Congress passed last year.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that investors in the TikTok deal would pay the US a fee in exchange for negotiating the agreement with China.\n\nIn the call on Friday, the Chinese president “emphasised the vital importance of US-China relations”, according to a Chinese readout of Friday’s phone call.\n\n“China’s position on the TikTok issue is clear,” the readout said. “The Chinese government respects the wishes of companies and welcomes them to conduct commercial negotiations based on market rules and reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance interests. China hopes that the US will provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies to invest in the US.”\n\nChina described the call as “pragmatic, positive, and constructive”.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump described the call as “very productive”. “We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,” Trump wrote.\n\nHe said he and Xi would meet at the Asia-Pacificeconomic cooperation summit in South Korea in late October and he would visit China “in the early part of next year”. China has not commented on when Trump and Xi might meet in person.\n\nThe TikTok deal was negotiated this week in Madrid, where the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and the Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng met to negotiate a trade deal. The US and China have agreed to a temporary pause in the trade war and the deadline to reach an agreement is 10 November.\n\nThe call came as Trump returned from a state visit to the UK, which was accompanied by news of a multibillion-dollar investment deal for US tech companies in the UK. Microsoft will invest $30bn while Nvidia will invest £11bn.\n\nUS tech companies have been caught in the cross-hairs of the US-China trade war. This week it was reported that China had ordered its top tech firms to stop buying semiconductors from Nvidia, which makes the world’s most advanced chips. Nvidia’s most high-end models are already banned by the US from being exported to China, but it had developed less sophisticated chips specifically for the Chinese market.\n\nThe Chinese readout of the call said Trump had praised Beijing’s recent military parade – the biggest showcase of military might in decades – as “magnificent”. The second world war commemoration parade, which was attended by Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un, was widely seen in the west as being a show of unity from an anti-American bloc.\n\nHowever, China has been keen to stress its cooperation with the allied forces in the second world war. According to the readout, Xi on Friday “pointed out that China and the United States were allies who fought side by side during world war two”.\n\nChina described US-China ties as “the most important bilateral relationship in the world”."

Despite a law requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its stake and prohibiting certain data-sharing agreements, the deal's legality remains uncertain, and there has been little political pushback against Trump’s decision to ignore the ban. This situation highlights a broader trend of the Trump administration circumventing established laws, raising concerns about the implications for constitutional authority and the enforcement of federal statutes.",
        "source": "Politico - Congress",
        "text": "On Friday, Trump is set to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping to agree to the terms of a proposed deal that is supposed to finally end the TikTok drama and bring all parties into compliance with the law. The deal reportedly involves some sort of sale to a consortium of investors that may include Trump allies and billionaires like Larry Ellison and Marc Andreessen, though the structure and legality of the agreement remain unclear. Indeed, whatever happens Friday is not likely to end the matter.\n\nThe law passed by Congress and signed into law under Joe Biden requires TikTok’s Beijing-based parent company ByteDance to divest at least 80 percent of its financial stake in the company and also precludes “any cooperation” concerning “the operation of a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect to data sharing.” Earlier this week, however, a Chinese cybersecurity official said that the framework includes “licensing the [TikTok] algorithm and other intellectual property rights.” Depending on the specifics, that licensing arrangement, with its “lethal algorithm” intact, could run afoul of the law. What then?\n\nSome Republican China hawks on Capitol Hill insisted this week that they will closely scrutinize the deal when the terms become clearer, but there has been almost no pushback from Republicans over Trump’s decision to unilaterally ignore the TikTok ban all year — and far less from Democrats than one might have expected.\n\nCotton did not respond to a request for comment about Trump’s continuing refusal to enforce the law, despite being a once-voluble critic of TikTok and the Chinese government’s control of the app and arguing that the app has already “cost the lives of many American kids.”\n\nA representative for Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri told me that if I wanted to hear from him on the matter, I was free to track him down in the Capitol. Hawley previously defended the ban and warned of the dangers of TikTok in January, shortly before Trump returned to office and announced that the administration would simply ignore it. “It’s not just a national security threat,” Hawley said of TikTok at the time. “It’s a personal security threat.”\n\nTrump himself once shared these concerns. In 2020, he signed an executive order declaring that TikTok’s data collection “threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information — potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.”\n\nThat, of course, was before Trump courted a billionaire donor with a stake in TikTok and before Trump decided that TikTok had helped him win his 2024 reelection bid. Last month, the White House created an official TikTok account — a further sign, if one was needed, of the Trump administration’s ongoing disregard for the ban passed by Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has benefited from an apparent lack of coordination and urgency on the Democratic side of the aisle.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer voted for the ban but later opposed immediate implementation of the law in January and endorsed a legislative extension before the law went into effect. That did not pass, but Trump has kept TikTok alive anyway without apparent legal authority to do so. Schumer did not respond to a request for comment on Trump’s series of TikTok executive orders this year.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, for his part, opposed the TikTok ban in the first place but said that he is waiting to see more about the deal before rendering a final opinion.\n\n“I’m working to make sure this deal does not lead to the censorship of free speech and will protect the millions of content creators who rely on TikTok,” he told POLITICO Magazine.\n\nThe whole situation has no apparent precedent in the annals of American law.\n\nSure, there are lots of laws on the books, and the federal government cannot enforce them all. That is why federal law enforcement relies heavily on priority-setting and careful attention to the opportunity costs of pursuing some crimes over others.\n\nThe Trump administration has made its agenda clear, and the ramifications have not been surprising. If, for example, you insist that federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors focus almost entirely on illegal immigration, then you are going to have fewer investigations and prosecutions for white-collar crime and financial fraud — which is exactly what is happening now.\n\nIn February, Trump announced that he was “pausing” enforcement of the foreign anti-bribery statute — a law that he notoriously hates — and in June, the Justice Department issued a memo that dramatically narrowed the circumstances under which the administration would enforce the law. In less overt fashion, the Justice Department has also significantly de-prioritized public corruption investigations, which Trump also hates.\n\nReasonable minds can often disagree about which federal laws merit the Justice Department’s focus at any given point in time, but the TikTok ban stands apart both for its public and political salience, as well as its simplicity.\n\nThe law passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress and was unanimously affirmed on constitutional grounds by the Supreme Court. In the wake of the murder of Charlie Kirk, the country is also now engaged in a national, rolling public debate about the polarizing and radicalizing dangers of social media, particularly on America’s youth.\n\nThe TikTok ban is also not subtle or particularly complicated to implement. It states that the Justice Department “shall conduct investigations related to potential violations” of the ban by tech companies, including third-party service providers, and that the Justice Department “shall pursue enforcement” if a violation has occurred. The fines that are supposed to apply are massive, potentially adding up to billions of dollars.\n\nInstead of abiding by this provision, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote letters to Apple, Google and other tech companies earlier this year informing them that she was effectively immunizing them for any violations of the law. She argued that enforcing the ban would “interfere with the execution of the President’s constitutional duties to take care of the national security and foreign affairs of the United States.”\n\nLeft unsaid was how this decision would comply with the president’s constitutional obligation to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” how it could be squared with Congress’ constitutional lawmaking authority, or why we should all be okay with the administration unilaterally disregarding the American public’s interest in having the executive branch enforce the laws passed by their elected representatives.\n\nThe TikTok ban may or may not be good on the merits. You may hate it or you may love it, but it is the law of the land — and it has been all year.\n\nIf the ban was a bad idea, then Congress could have repealed the law or passed a legislative extension, but neither of those things has happened. Instead, pretty much every politician in Washington — on both sides of the aisle — has effectively decided that the law can be flagrantly ignored because of TikTok’s popularity and the potential electoral fallout that could result from antagonizing the app’s relatively young user base.\n\nThis is not how laws are supposed to work in this country.\n\nCongress is supposed to pass them, and the president is supposed to enforce them. There are no constitutional carve-outs for popular social media apps or for companies that helped you win your election.\n\nOver the last eight months, the Trump administration has run roughshod over Congress and its constitutional prerogatives. Trump’s decision to ignore the TikTok ban on his first day in office may seem minor in the grand scheme of things, but it foreshadowed a series of far more aggressive moves to usurp much of lawmakers’ constitutional authority: dismantling congressionally-created agencies, redirecting congressionally appropriated funds and implementing a massive tax hike on the American public in the form of Trump’s chaotic tariff regime.\n\nThe vast majority of this was made possible by congressional Republicans, who have largely turned a blind eye to all of Trump’s gambits, and by the Republican appointees on the Supreme Court, who have handed Trump a series of victories this year in his wide-ranging efforts to both unilaterally slash the federal government while dramatically expanding the powers of the presidency.\n\nThe acquiescence to Trump’s TikTok reprieve this year has been a far more bipartisan affair, but it has been a constitutional farce all the same, and it is not over yet."

        "text": "President Donald Trump spent the bulk of the week in the U.K. where he inked a new tech deal, and closed out the week gearing up to attend the memorial service of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Arizona.\n\nDuring the trip abroad, Trump and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer unveiled a new $350 billion tech investment plan, which is expected to generate 15,000 jobs across the U.K. and up to 2,500 jobs in the U.S.\n\nSpecific details of the \"Tech Prosperity Deal\" are sparse, but officials said that the plan will invest in the development of 12 advanced nuclear reactors and that energy will go toward supplying energy needs for the U.K. and the U.S.\n\n\"It's a blueprint to win this new era together. Shape it according to our shared values, and seize the incredible opportunities that are on offer,\" Starmer said. \"We have huge new investments from Nvidia N scale, Open AI, Google, Salesforce and many more backing cutting-edge British jobs for years to come.\"\n\nTRUMP HEADS TO UK FOR RARE SECOND STATE VISIT, THEN TO ARIZONA FOR CHARLIE KIRK'S FUNERAL\n\nThe plan will accumulate $50 billion in economic value and will deliver power to as many as 1.5 million homes, according to Trump.\n\nTrump also touted the close relationship between the U.S. and the U.K. during a state dinner at Windsor Castle with members of the U.K.’s royal family, including King Charles III.\n\n\"His Majesty spoke eloquently about the bond which inspired Sir Winston Churchill — the bust is in the Oval Office right now — the beautiful bust of Winston Churchill, to coin the phrase ‘special relationship,’ but seen from American eyes, the word ‘special’ does not begin to do it justice,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"We're joined by history and fate, by love and language and by transcendent ties of culture, tradition, ancestry and destiny.\"\n\nTRUMP EYES REMARKS AT CHARLIE KIRK MEMORIAL IN ARIZONA, BLAMES LEFT FOR SUSPECT’S RADICALIZATION\n\nTrump arrived back in Washington later Thursday and will leave for Kirk’s memorial service Sunday at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The venue holds 63,400 people and has the capacity for up to 73,000 for \"mega-events,\" according to its website.\n\nKirk, 31, was killed during a stop on his American Comeback Tour Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University. Kirk’s death has also raised questions about Trump’s own security, amid two assassination attempts on Trump’s life in 2024.\n\nA senior administration official confirmed to Fox News Digital Friday that federal law enforcement agencies like the Department of Homeland Security released a report Thursday cautioning that they are monitoring \"several threats of unknown credibility\" against Trump, Vice President JD Vance and others expected to attend Kirk’s memorial service.\n\nTRUMP’S SECURITY UNDER SCRUTINY AS SECRET SERVICE BRACES FOR KIRK MEMORIAL\n\nThe assessment asserts that the memorial may be an attractive target for violent extremists or lone wolf actors due to the significant media coverage it's expected to attract.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump said he likely will share some remarks during the memorial service.\n\n\"It's going to be big,\" Trump told reporters Monday. \"I'm going to be at the stadium, and I guess I'll say a few words. I don't know, but I guess I will, but I knew him very well. He was an amazing guy. He was all about young people and getting them started.\""

An armed group called The Resistance Front (TRF), which demands independence for Kashmir, claimed responsibility for the attack, but India had alleged Pakistani involvement.\n\nPakistan denied any role in the attacks and asked for an independent investigation to be carried out.\n\nTwo days later, Pakistan responded to the missile strikes by attacking military installations across its frontier with India and Indian-administered Kashmir, striking at least four facilities.\n\nThe conflict ended four days later, thanks to an internationally-brokered ceasefire.\n\nWhile the exchange of aerial fire came to a halt, the diplomatic ties between the neighbours remained suspended, and the political tension spilled over into cricket as India’s players walked off the field without shaking hands with their opposition.\n\nA few moments later, Pakistan’s players trudged off in a group and waited for the Indian squad and support staff to come out and shake hands, as is the norm at the end of cricket matches.\n\nHowever, the Indian contingent only shook hands with each other before walking into their dressing room and shutting the door as the waiting Pakistan players looked on.\n\nShortly after the events unfolded, Pakistan’s manager Naveed Akram Cheema lodged a protest against the Indian cricket team’s actions with Andy Pycroft, who is an International Cricket Council (ICC) accredited match referee.\n\nPakistan alleged that Pycroft did not clearly communicate the Indian team’s decision to not partake in the handshake, an act they termed in contravention of the spirit of cricket.\n\nPakistan demanded Pycroft’s removal as match referee for their remaining fixtures in the tournament, but later reached an agreement with the ICC and Pycroft went on to officiate Pakistan’s last group game against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Wednesday.\n\nThe Pakistan-UAE match was delayed by an hour as officials from the ICC and Pakistan’s team management held a meeting at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium before the match.\n\n“The ICC’s match referee, Andy Pycroft, has apologised to the manager and captain of the Pakistan cricket team,” the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in a statement.\n\n“Andy Pycroft termed the September 14 incident a result of miscommunication.”\n\nThe PCB also said that the ICC “expressed its willingness to conduct an inquiry into the code of conduct violation that occurred during the September 14 match”, referring to Pycroft’s request to Pakistan and India captains to avoid the customary handshake at the toss, which the PCB alleges contravened the laws of the game.\n\nHowever, a source within the ICC told Al Jazeera that Pycroft did not apologise to Pakistan and only clarified his position.\n\nThe source also said that the ICC had investigated the issue and concluded that it did not warrant action against the Zimbabwean match referee.\n\nThe Zimbabwean match official will be in charge of Sunday’s India-Pakistan fixture as well."

This incident followed heightened tensions due to accusations of terrorism and military hostilities between the two nations, leading to a complaint from Pakistan's team regarding the lack of sportsmanship. Observers note that the match reflects the deteriorating relations between India and Pakistan, with cricket increasingly becoming a platform for political expression rather than unity.",
        "source": "Guardian",
        "text": "As nationalistic rivalries go, few run as deep as India and Pakistan. But even as the neighbours fought wars against each other, carried out rival nuclear tests and conducted nightly shows of strength along their heavily militarised border, there was always one thing that brought them together: cricket.\n\nBut as the two sides came together on Sunday for a match in the Asia Cup tournament, the camaraderie that was once celebrated as cricket diplomacy had vanished.\n\nAt the end of the game – after India had won a crushing triumph – instead of the usual respectful handshake between the two sides, the Indian team simply walked off the field.\n\nThe match was the first meeting of the Indian and Pakistani teams since Delhi accused Islamabad of masterminding a terrorist attack in the disputed Indian region of Kashmir in April, which killed 26 people. Pakistan denied any involvement.\n\nIndia launched an armed response and fired missiles into Pakistan, leading to four days of tit-for-tat hostilities and exchanges of fire in May that pushed the two nuclear-armed countries closer to all-out war than they had been in decades.\n\nSpeaking after the match, India’s captain, Suryakumar Yadav, said the decision not to shake hands had been a “team call”.\n\n“We had come only to play,” Yadav told Indian media. “Some things are beyond sportsmanship. We dedicate this victory to our armed forces who took part in Operation Sindoor and stand with families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.”\n\nIn response, Pakistan’s captain, Salman Ali Agha, did not attend the post-match ceremony. Pakistan’s coach, the New Zealander Mike Hesson, said their side had been “ready to shake hands at the end of the game. We were disappointed that our opposition didn’t do that.”\n\nIndia’s actions were met with outrage in Pakistan. The team lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council, calling for the referee to be removed – a demand the ICC refused. In a statement afterwards, the chair of the Pakistan Cricket Board, Mohsin Naqvi, said it was “utterly disappointing to witness the lack of sportsmanship today”.\n\n“We have always advocated for sports and politics to be kept apart,” Naqvi said in an interview with the Guardian. “Cricket is a global sport that should unite rather than divide. Our concern has never been about individuals or governments, but about ensuring clarity, fairness in match protocols, and upholding the spirit of the game.”\n\nOn Wednesday night, amid threats by the Pakistan team to boycott the rest of the Asia Cup tournament, the match referee, Andy Pycroft, apologised to Agha, describing the handshake incident as a “miscommunication”.\n\nAfter both sides qualified for the second group stage of the tournament, they will meet again on Sunday.\n\nObservers said last week’s incident signalled the clear demise of cricket diplomacy – which until recently had helped keep politics off the field even at the lowest moments – and was evidence of just how much Indo-Pakistan relations had soured.\n\nIn 1987, Pakistan’s president, the army general Zia-ul-Haq, made a surprise visit to India to watch a Test match – part of what he called a “cricket for peace” initiative – as tensions were rising between the two countries.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2007, the two countries played four successful Test series on each other’s turf. In 2004, as the Indian team travelled to Pakistan, the Indian prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told them: “Whether you win or lose doesn’t matter to me, but while you are there, you must win the hearts of the Pakistani people.”\n\nHowever, since the Mumbai attacks of 2008, which were orchestrated by terrorist groups operating from Pakistan, such cross-border sportsmanship has been increasingly rare, with cricket and politics becoming visibly intertwined in both countries.\n\nUnder India’s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi, who was elected in 2014, cricket has become increasingly utilised as a political tool. The country’s largest cricket stadium was named after the prime minister, while the ICC, the sport’s powerful global governing body, is run by Jay Shah, the son of India’s home minister and Modi’s closest ally, Amit Shah.\n\nIn Pakistan, where the heavily jingoistic and anti-India military governs behind the scenes, the cricket board chair, Naqvi, is also the minister of the interior.\n\nSushant Singh, an Indian defence analyst who previously served in the Indian army, said that “instead of building fraternal ties and people-to-people contact”, the cricket field had now become “the site of playing out nationalist fantasies”.\n\nThe former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi, who travelled to India several times for matches and described himself as a “staunch supporter of cricket diplomacy” lamented its loss. He said every time he had played over the border he “received a lot of love and support from Indians” and that in his two decades of playing, had “never witnessed such off-the-field behaviour from Indian players”.\n\n“In the past, the wars and conflict between both countries did not stop cricket matches,” said Afridi. “We greeted each other with respect on the field and we did not see hatred among players. Even during tough times such as the Kargil conflict, we remained welcoming to each other and enjoyed meeting off the field as sportsmen.”\n\nOsman Samiuddin, a senior editor at ESPNCricinfo and author of The Unquiet Ones: A History of Pakistan Cricket, said the two countries were now in an era where “the opposite of cricket diplomacy is happening”.\n\nCiting other recent examples, such when India refused to travel to Pakistan for this year’s Champions Trophy, he said: “They are actually now taking out their hostility through cricket – it’s become both a vehicle and a proxy for the tense relations between the two countries.”\n\nHe warned that India’s actions at Sunday’s match, and the refusal by the ICC to censure the captain for it, could set a “a dangerous precedent for other players in the future” when it came to keeping politics out of the game.\n\nSamiuddin said that given the regimes in both countries, he did not see a return of the old sporting camaraderie, on or off the field, anytime soon. “I just don’t think the political conditions in either country are encouraging enough for it.”"

Throughout their travels, the hoodie has led to unexpected connections and support from strangers, highlighting the stark contrast between their freedom to express solidarity and the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. Despite acknowledging the limitations of such expressions in effecting change, the author finds moments of solidarity and understanding amidst the ongoing crisis.",
        "source": "AlJazeera",
        "text": "Earlier this month, my mother and I took the train from Samarkand, Uzbekistan, to the city of Bukhara, two and a half hours away. While I was waiting in line for the toilet, an Uzbek train attendant approached to express his delight at the hoodie I was wearing, which is black with a Palestinian flag and the words “Free Palestine” in both English and Arabic.\n\nDuring our ensuing conversation in modified English, the young man advised me to steer clear of Wagon Seven of the train, as it was full of Israeli tourists. He himself had requested to be reassigned from said wagon, he told me, so as to avoid having to deal with them. He proceeded to wonder how people could live with themselves while their government was slaughtering children en masse.\n\nIndeed, of the more than 65,000 Palestinians Israel has officially killed in less than two years in the Gaza Strip – likely a severe underestimate – nearly 20,000 have been children. This is to say nothing of the countless kids who have been permanently maimed, mutilated and traumatised.\n\nBefore arriving in Bukhara, the train attendant suggested we document our sweatshirt-based encounter with a selfie. In the photo, he gave the thumbs up for Palestine, and then my mother and I were on our way.\n\nThis was not the first time that this particular hoodie had attracted attention. The previous week in the security line at the airport in Istanbul, an Arab woman travelling with her family asked to photograph the shirt. Then the female security guard who patted me down informed me, in Turkish, that I was a “good person”.\n\nGenerally having a rather different opinion of myself, I inquired as to how she had possibly come to this conclusion, and was told that any American citizen who supported Palestine was automatically a good person.\n\nTo be sure, the United States has not done much for its international reputation by avidly backing Israel’s genocide from the get-go, first under former President Joe Biden and now under Donald Trump. In addition to providing billions upon billions of dollars to the Israeli killing machine, the US has also provided it with far-reaching diplomatic cover, including by vetoing six United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nHands down, the most unexpected compliment I have thus far received on the Free Palestine hoodie came from an agent with the US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) – which doesn’t exactly have the greatest reputation either – at none other than Dulles International Airport outside the nation’s capital of Washington, DC.\n\nIt was last October, one year into the genocidal spectacle, and I was flying to Mexico City. While scanning my passport, the agent, an older white man, said he liked my shirt and lamented the ongoing horror in Gaza. He went on to ask if I had read any books by Israeli anti-Zionist historian Ilan Pappe, author of The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine and other titles, as I stared at him in shock.\n\nGranted, this was several months before Trump reassumed the presidency and went about effectively criminalising opposition to genocide by abducting and disappearing students and scholars who had expressed support for Gaza.\n\nFree Palestine apparel has earned me plenty of other friends, too. There was the Sudanese human rights lawyer-turned-ride-share driver in Washington who gave me a hug, the woman in the Athens airport who commented “Long live Palestine”, and the United Airlines flight attendant who whispered to me almost conspiratorially that he approved of my outfit.\n\nIt may appear that the garment’s popularity is restricted to the context of travel by plane, train, and so forth – an impression that has to do with various factors. The first is that I travel a lot, having suffered for most of my life from a pathological inability to sit still. The second is that I am always freezing in airports, which got me to thinking that if I must wear a sweater, it might as well be a Free Palestine one.\n\nAnd yet it is undeniably grotesque that, thanks purely to a passport bestowed on me by the number one abettor of mass slaughter and enforced starvation in Gaza, I am able to jaunt freely around the world in a Free Palestine hoodie, while the Palestinians of Gaza are trapped within the borders of a tiny strip of land that Israel has converted into an open-air exhibition of some of the worst atrocities known to humanity.\n\nAlthough the black hoodie is currently serving as my official travel uniform, I have it in blue, as well. I also have a Palestinian flag dress, a Palestinian flag facemask, and two Palestine football shirts, one of which I wore last year when I entered the Darien Gap – the notorious stretch of roadless territory and perilous jungle straddling Colombia and Panama that has become a veritable graveyard for international refuge seekers.\n\nIn recent years, hundreds of thousands of the world’s have-nots have been forced to risk their lives crossing the Darien Gap in the hopes of eventually reaching the US. During my own brief journalistic incursion, I met two men from Yemen – itself no stranger to US-backed terror – who pronounced my Palestine shirt “very good” and offered their assistance in case I needed anything in the jungle.\n\nMeanwhile, the only negative feedback to the Palestine hoodie that I can recall took place in February of this year in the city of Mazatlan in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa, home of the eponymous drug cartel. It is also home to a number of archetypal gringo “expats”, who often do not bother to learn Spanish and who apparently detect no irony in taking advantage of Mexico’s lower living costs while simultaneously endorsing Trump’s mass deportation campaign – which affects a whole lot of Mexicans – just across the border.\n\nOne such gringo caricature was personally offended by my hoodie, and took it upon himself to shout belligerently: “So you support Hamas?!” I responded in decidedly impolite fashion, and my Mexican companion and I returned to our beers.\n\nObviously, my Free Palestine sweatshirt is not going to stop a genocide. It is not going to undo the Israeli strike on the home of 10-year-old Noor Faraj or give the child her two legs back. It is not going to resuscitate Palestinian newborns who have been starved to death.\n\nBut in a world that is rapidly going to hell, it has at least made for some fleetingly uplifting moments."

The event showcases traditional music and dance, with participants emphasizing their cultural heritage, while the Kremlin uses it to project a softer image despite the backdrop of the war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "Russia's answer to Eurovision is less kitsch, more Kremlin\n\n18 hours ago\n\nSteve RosenbergRussia editor in Moscow\n\nAt a Moscow concert hall, Shohruhmirzo Ganiev is crooning about love and his motherland, Uzbekistan.\n\n\"Put your legs together like a man,\" suggests his voice coach and choreographer. \"And spread your arms wider!\"\n\nIt's just a rehearsal, but Shohruhmirzo is singing his heart out. He's performing traditional Uzbek melodies to a modern beat and playing a doira, the ancient drum of Central Asia.\n\nUzbekistan is among 23 countries competing at the Intervision Song Contest.\n\nIt's Russia's answer to Eurovision. With less kitsch – and more Kremlin.\n\nIntervision 2025 is Vladimir Putin's brainchild. He signed a decree reviving the Soviet-era songfest with the aim of \"developing international cultural and humanitarian co-operation\".\n\nThe more obvious objective is creating an international song contest in which Moscow can actually take part. In 2022 Russia was banned from competing in Eurovision after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA pattern's emerging.\n\nWhen Team Russia was banned from the Olympic Games, Moscow tried to create alternatives, like the Games of the Future and the World Friendship Games.\n\nNow the Kremlin's come up with its own version of Eurovision.\n\nBut what does it look like and who is taking part?\n\nFor Intervision, the Russians have cast their musical net far and wide, inviting allies from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. The starting line-up reflects the political and economic alliances of which Russia is part, like the Brics group of nations, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Commonwealth of Independent States.\n\nThe list of participating countries includes China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Vietnam, Venezuela, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Madagascar: a very different musical map from Eurovision, and an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that, despite its invasion of Ukraine, Russia still has friends.\n\nThe United States, too, is taking part: a sign of the thaw in US-Russian relations since Donald Trump's return to the White House.\n\nThaw doesn't mean problem-free. America's original Intervision entrant Brandon Howard pulled out on the eve of the contest.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I had some... family issues that happened here domestically, that I wasn't [going] to be able to go abroad and do that,\" the singer, who performs as B.Howard, tells me on a call from the US.\n\n\"However, I really believe that it's such a wonderful event.\"\n\n\"Were there some people who said to you 'Brandon, you shouldn't go, because of the war?'\" I asked.\n\n\"Some fans would mention some things like that and expressed slight concern. However, for the most part, everyone was very supportive of me going there, being sent to be a beacon of light.\"\n\nB.Howard has been replaced by Australian-Greek singer Vassy who lives in Los Angeles.\n\n\"4.3 billion people live in the 23 participating countries,\" boasted senior Kremlin official Sergei Kiriyenko. \"That's more than half the world's population.\"\n\nMr Kiriyenko, President Putin's deputy chief of staff, chairs the song contest's supervisory board. He made a brief appearance this week at an Intervision press conference alongside Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko.\n\n\"I know some people think there's an element of politics in Eurovision,\" I tell Mr Lavrov. \"But look who's represented here: the Kremlin, the foreign ministry and the Russian government. Isn't that proof that Intervision is a purely political or geopolitical project?\"\n\n\"If the governments of some countries make no effort to create mechanisms for supporting culture, that's their choice,\" Mr Lavrov replies. \"In our country the state is engaged in the promotion of the arts. Your question is rooted in the fear of competition.\"\n\nIn Ukraine they fear something quite different: that Moscow is using Intervision to divert global attention from the war.\n\n\"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine considers that the Intervision 2025 song contest organised by Russia is an instrument of hostile propaganda and a means of whitewashing the aggressive policy of the Russian Federation,\" the ministry stated back in May.\n\nThe war is on some people's minds at Intervision.\n\n\"The scary thing is with the war, with whatever's happening. These are the things we were thinking about,\" says Renee Kruger from South African group Mzansi Jikelele.\n\n\"But we were assured: 'Just come, guys, nothing's wrong'. Obviously, we are [nervous], but we're here and we've been treated very well.\"\n\nRepresenting Russia at Intervision 2025 is Yaroslav Dronov, better known by his stage name Shaman. Last year the European Union sanctioned him for \"supporting actions and policies that undermine the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine.\"\n\nHis previous hits include I'm Russian, a patriotic pop song that declares:\n\n\"I'm Russian, I go to the end… I'm Russian, to spite the whole world.\"\n\nNot exactly Love Shine A Light or Save Your Kisses for Me.\n\nBut Russia is using Intervision to project a softer image than the one forged by three-and-a-half years of its war in Ukraine.\n\nAt the official song contest draw to decide the running order, international delegations are being treated to a Russian feast, including cottage cheese pancakes and gingerbread sporting the Intervision logo. As folk dancers put on a spectacular show, volunteers hand out giant necklaces of bread rings, a symbol of Russian hospitality.\n\nOne by one the participants approach a gigantic samovar, select a tea cup and fill it with hot water. The magic mugs reveal the performance slot number for each country.\n\nFrom the folk costumes to the blinis, the emphasis here is on tradition.\n\nIt's the same with the songs. The official goal of the contest is to \"get to know the unique cultural traditions and achievements of participating countries [and] promote universal, spiritual, family, cultural, ethical and religious traditions of different nations.\"\n\nThe international performers have read the rulebook.\n\n\"My song tells about culture from Vietnam,\" Vietnamese entrant Duc Phuc informs me. \"I need to share the culture of Vietnam with everyone.\"\n\n\"How were you chosen to represent your country?\" I ask.\n\n\"The Ministry of Culture chose me.\"\n\n\"Our song is about a woman called Maria,\" says Brazilian entrant Tais Nader. \"Maria is like any Brazilian woman. She works hard to live. But she's always smiling and her eyes are shining.\"\n\n\"Have you heard of Eurovision?\" I ask.\n\n\"Actually, we searched online about Intervision and discovered Eurovision! Before, we didn't know about Intervision or Eurovision. It's new for us.\"\n\nFor many Russians, too, Intervision is something new. In fact it is a ghost from communist times summoned from the grave of song contests past.\n\nThe original Intervision Song Contest was born behind the Iron Curtain at a time when East and West competed in everything. In the Cold War there was a space race, an arms race and culture wars, too.\n\nFrom the mid-1950s Eurovision quickly established itself as a big deal in Western Europe, while in the Eastern bloc song festivals in Czechoslovakia and Poland acquired the occasional tag of 'Intervision'.\n\nThere was, though, some crossover. Finland took part in both Eurovision and Intervision, and big names from the West made guest appearances in the East. Gloria Gaynor, Petula Clarke and Boney-M all performed at Intervision.\n\nAfter the fall of communism Russia and Eastern Europe embraced the political changes sweeping the continent and were eager to compete in Eurovision. I saw that first hand in 1996 when, by a quirk of fate, I co-presented Russian TV's Song for Europe competition to select a Eurovision entry.\n\nDuring a guided tour of Russian TV, I'd got chatting to the show's director. When I told him I was a huge Eurovision fan he'd asked me to come back that evening to help anchor the programme. I'll never forget how excited everyone in the studio was that night: not only about Eurovision, but about Russia being part of the European family.\n\nBut will people watch it? Will the Intervision singers and songs capture the public's imagination across so many continents? The considerable time differences between the participating countries will likely preclude the kind of shared viewing experience you get with Eurovision.\n\nAnd there'll be no public vote. Just a jury: one member per country. But how will the voting take place?\n\n\"The voting system is specially invented by a very famous scientist and mathematician,\" Russian TV's Intervision commentator Yana Churikova tells me. \"Specially for Intervision.\"\n\nBack in the rehearsal room, Uzbekistan's entrant Shohruhmirzo Ganiev admits he doesn't know the intricacies of the voting system. He's just excited to be here. So is his mother. She's looking on proudly as her son rehearses.\n\nEven though his country isn't in Eurovision, Shohruhmirzo tells me that contest is famous in Uzbekistan. Right now, though, he's focused on his performance here.\n\n\"I'm very happy to come to Intervision,\" he tells me. \"I'm leaving Eurovision in the past.\""

        "text": "Thousands of people are expected to join a mass protest in Manila on Sunday amid a groundswell of anger in the Philippines against perceived corruption in government-funded flood control projects.\n\nDubbed the “Trillion Peso March”, the demonstration is named after a Greenpeace estimate of $17.6bn that the environmental organisation alleges is the amount skimmed from climate-related projects in 2023.\n\nThe 21 September demonstration holds symbolic historical significance, coinciding with the anniversary of the same day in 1972 when then-leader Ferdinand Marcos imposed martial law.\n\nIt was a massive people-power movement that ultimately toppled the decades-long reign of Marcos, who was forced to flee the country in 1989 amid widespread public discontent and allegations of rampant corruption.\n\nThe current president, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr, the son of the former leader, has sought to placate angry Filipinos, saying that he supports the protests.\n\n“Do you blame them for going out on the streets?” he told reporters at a press conference this week. “If I weren’t president, I might be out in the streets with them.\n\n“Of course, they are enraged. They are angry, I’m angry. We should all be angry, because what is happening is not right.”\n\nCivil society and church organisations are among groups that have called for the joint demonstrations, which have parallels with outrage over alleged government corruption and privilege across the region.\n\nA gen Z-led protest movement toppled the government of Nepal this month, while a series of demonstrations also erupted in Indonesia, sparked by privileges afforded to lawmakers, which the government has since been forced to retract.\n\nThis week angry young people in East Timor also took to the streets to demand that a plan to give lawmakers free SUVs be revoked. In the face of the unrest, the government has now scrapped the plan.\n\nIn the Philippines, public anger has been intensifying over so-called ghost infrastructure projects after Marcos put them centre stage in a July state of the nation address that followed weeks of deadly flooding.\n\nMartin Romualdez, a cousin of President Marcos and the speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives, tendered his resignation on Wednesday.\n\n“The issues surrounding certain infrastructure projects have raised questions that weigh not only upon me but upon this institution we all serve,” Romualdez said.\n\n“The longer I stay, the heavier that burden grows.”\n\nIn a speech before the plenary, Romualdez said he had tendered his resignation with “a full heart and a clear conscience”.\n\n“I do this so that the independent commission on infrastructure may pursue its mandate freely and fully – without doubt, without interference and without undue influence,” he said, adding that he unequivocally supported calls for accountability.\n\nLast week, the owners of a construction firm accused nearly 30 House members and officials in the department of public works and highways of taking cash payments.\n\nMarcos on Monday announced former supreme court justice Andres Reyes would head a three-person commission tasked with looking into the past decade of flood-control projects."

The demonstration, which aimed to promote \"free speech,\" devolved into violent clashes with police, resulting in multiple injuries and arrests. Notable speakers included Elon Musk and French politician Éric Zemmour, who amplified anti-immigrant sentiments while around 5,000 counter-protesters rallied against the event.",
        "source": "theguardian",
        "text": "More than 110,000 people have taken part in a far-right street protest organised by the activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson, in what is thought to be the largest nationalist event in decades.\n\nMarchers travelled to London by train and coach for a demonstration, which was billed as a “festival of free speech”, but by its conclusion had amplified racist conspiracy theories and anti-Muslim hate speech across Whitehall.\n\nThe scale of the protest vastly outgrew police estimates resulting in tense and at times violent clashes between protesters and police.\n\nThe Metropolitan police said at least 25 people were arrested and 26 officers were injured, including four who were seriously hurt. Marchers were arrested for a range of offences, including affray, violent disorder, assaults and criminal damage.\n\nThe crowds were addressed by Elon Musk, who dialled in via video link and spoke of “the rapidly increasing erosion of Britain”, before calling for the dissolution of the UK parliament.\n\nThe French far-right politician Éric Zemmour was also invited to speak. He told protesters they were subject to “the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture”, adding that “you and we are being colonised by our former colonies”.\n\nThe huge turnout meant attenders could not be contained within Whitehall, the endpoint of the march, where the rally was being held. The swelling numbers resulted in clashes with police with the Met saying officers “faced unacceptable violence” after being “assaulted with kicks and punches. Bottles, flares and other projectiles were thrown.”\n\nAbout 5,000 counter-protesters from trade unions and anti-fascist groups marched in a separate route in central London.\n\nLarge crowds displaying union jack and St George flags had been drifting into central London since the early morning in anticipation of the rally.\n\nShortly before 1pm, people began marching across Westminster Bridge. The crowd, which was largely white, sang “Keir Starmer’s a wanker” to the tune of Seven Nation Army and broke into chants of “Tommy”, “Whose street? Our street” and “England”. Some also held signs in support of Tommy Robinson.\n\nOn the approach to Whitehall, stalls sold books co-authored by Robinson titled “Manifesto: Free Speech, Real Democracy, Peaceful Disobedience” and “Mohammed’s Koran: Why Muslims Kill for Islam”.\n\nOne elderly woman in a wheelchair, who travelled to attend from Merseyside with her son, held a sign with Charlie Kirk’s face on it with the words: “God bless, never forget”.\n\n“I’m British through and through; this is our capital,” she said. “I had to be here today for our country.”\n\nHer son added: “I feel our country is being inundated with the ideology which is trying to suppress and suppress us and I just want our country back.”\n\nThe pair said they were “followers of Tommy Robinson and what he stands for”, adding the “establishment just want him out”. They denied it was a far-right event, saying their attendance was a “patriotic visit”.\n\nThe mother said when she was a child in Liverpool, she “lived amongst neighbours from Africa, Pakistan; we were all one. It’s not about race, this is the government just overcrowding our country.”\n\nCarol took the coach from south Wales to attend the rally. She said she was there because “we need to unite the kingdom basically, it just seems to be so divided. We just need to come together, all of us.” Elaborating on this, she said: “It seems to be one half can say ‘I do what I want’, and the other half have to watch everything they do.”\n\nShe held a sign that read “Change my mind: RIP Charlie”, referencing Kirk’s open-invitation college campus debates. She said she “probably picked up on him about a year ago” after he came up on her social media feed.\n\nWhen asked what she thought of Robinson’s involvement in the rally, she said: “When I first heard of him in 2017, the consensus and opinion around him was that he’s a bad un.” Since then, “having looked more into what he does”, she said: “He’s doing really well. He’s changed a lot of minds.”\n\nWhitehall quickly became so full that it was closed to marchers before the first speakers even took to the stage, leaving thousands stuck on Westminster Bridge and in Parliament Square.\n\nOn Whitehall, crammed in front of three big screens, the crowds swelled to what felt like dangerous levels. People stood on bus stops and portable toilets to get a better view of the stage.\n\nOne man waved a sign saying: “Why are white people despised when our tax money pays for everything?” Another had a placard that said: “Call centres: speak English.”\n\nThe rally began with music. Members of the Destiny Church in New Zealand performed a traditional haka dance for the protesters, which was followed by a song with the lyrics “Making the west look like the Middle East”. They then displayed the flags of the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State and Palestine to boos from the crowd, before tearing each of them in half to loud cheers.\n\nRobinson then took to the stage and said “Britain has finally awoken” and that “this is never going away”. He claimed that British courts ruled that the rights of undocumented migrants supersede those of the “local community”, referring to Epping council’s failed case against the Home Office.\n\n“They told the world that Somalians, Afghanis, Pakistanis, all of them, their rights supersede yours – the British public, the people that built this nation.”\n\nHe then played a video that included images of convicted members of a grooming gang followed by a video of a white woman crying.\n\nElon Musk, speaking by video link, told the crowd: “I think there’s something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration.”\n\n“A failure by the government to protect innocent people including children who are getting gang-raped. It’s unreal the government has failed in its duty to protect its citizens, which is a fundamental duty of government.”\n\nZemmour, who came in fourth place in the first round of the 2022 French presidential election, told the crowd in French, which was translated for the audience, that the “freedom of our peoples is in danger”.\n\nAt the anti-fascist march, the MP Diane Abbott told a crowd that Tommy Robinson’s allies “are some of the most anti-women forces in society”.\n\nShe said: “They are trying to drag women into their project, they are claiming that they are protecting women, but they are some of the most anti-women forces in society – they oppose equal pay, they oppose action against discrimination, they belittle sexual harassment as banter.\n\n“So we are here to stand together, we are here to fight, and we are here in the certainty that we will defeat the fascists.”\n\nA Met assistant commissioner, Matt Twist, said police faced a “wholly unacceptable” level of violence. He said an investigation had begun and the force was working to identify suspects involved in disorder.\n\nHe added: “There is no doubt that many came to exercise their lawful right to protest, but there were many who came intent on violence. They confronted officers, engaging in physical and verbal abuse and making a determined effort to breach cordons in place to keep everyone safe.\n\n“The violence they faced was wholly unacceptable. Twenty-six officers were injured, including four seriously – among them broken teeth, a possible broken nose, a concussion, a prolapsed disc and a head injury.”"

Despite this, community members emphasize their strong spirit and resilience, especially in the wake of recent tragedies, including the murder of a local scientist and the death of a beloved teenager. Local leaders and volunteers are working to address social challenges and promote inclusivity, demonstrating a commitment to unity rather than division in the face of external narratives.",
        "source": "theguardian",
        "text": "The old mill chimney stack still towers over the high street in Lochee, a Dundee neighbourhood once world renowned for its jute industry.\n\nThis “village within a city”, as locals describe it, came to global attention again last month when Elon Musk amplified anti-immigrant misinformation about an incident allegedly involving a 12-year-old girl who was charged with being in possession of offensive weapons.\n\nScotland’s first minister John Swinney accused the multibillionaire X owner of undermining community cohesion after he shared widely circulated video footage of the incident. Later, police also confirmed that a man and a woman had been charged.\n\nA month later, Lochee locals are still processing the reverberations: ‘Dundee girl’ was declared a hero by far-right influencers, including Tommy Robinson, with memes depicting her as Braveheart, while mainstream media called the area “Scotland’s Bronx”, highlighting “tower blocks stuffed with addicts and migrants”.\n\nWhat the hot takes and hatchet jobs didn’t explain is that this online frenzy concluded a summer of tragedy for Lochee – one in which community spirit, rather than division, has shone through.\n\nIn a brutal killing of the kind rarely seen in the area, Dr Fortune Gomo, 39, a scientist from Zimbabwe who graduated from Dundee University, was found fatally injured in the street in early July. And later that month a popular teenager and ice hockey champion who grew up there, Gary Kelly, fell to his death while on holiday in Ibiza.\n\n“It’s been a really sad time for Lochee but it’s also shown it at its best,” says Heather Henry, chair of Love Lochee community group. “For all the tragedy and the negative press, there’s an amazing community spirit. And we’ve seen that over the past month, all the love that has poured out for those poor families.”\n\nHenry dismisses Musk in a word: “Clickbait. People have said: ‘This is not who we are.’ But you have to come here to see it.”\n\nBecause what has likewise escaped global attention are the dogged efforts by volunteers, many of them women, to take on Lochee’s undeniable challenges at street level. The colourful murals that brighten up the lanes off the high street were commissioned by Henry’s group. Kayley, who grew up in Lochee and is shopping here with her mum, says she loves them but wants something done about the sky-high rents that have resulted in empty units where once were thriving independent businesses.\n\nAt the top of the hill, a group of street drinkers huddle on a bench, but Kayley says local efforts – which include a new drop-in centre for addicts – have improved antisocial behaviour from drug users, and is full of praise for the community hub across the road.\n\nCouncillor Siobhan Tolland offers a brisk tour of community endeavours – the library offering a warm space to visit for a cuppa in winter, a food bank that is struggling to keep up with demand, the community garden with its laden apple tree: “There’s a lot of poverty in Lochee and it’s not an easy life, but [after Musk] there was a sense of ‘don’t put us down’.”\n\nWhile police said that Dr Gomo’s attack was not believed to be racially motivated, her death prompted women from all communities to speak more openly about a recent shift in mood on the streets across Dundee.\n\nAt Dundee International Women’s Centre, both service users and staff report an increase in aggressive looks, tuts and racist comments, coming from children as well as adults.\n\nProject leader Asma Hussein works with local colleges educating young people about hate and misinformation, and describes students sharing rumours of immigrants “coming over here and raping our girls”. She plans to use ‘Dundee girl’ as a case study: “Everyone looked at the weapons, not what was going on behind it.”\n\nAnd the aggression isn’t reserved for recent migrants. Back on the high street, the Polish owner of a vintage clothing shop, Joanne Wodkowska, who has lived in Scotland for 17 years, tells how her shop was attacked by kids throwing eggs and using anti-Polish slurs last year. Earlier this year, a white Scottish customer walked out of the shop telling her: “I’m not buying clothes from someone who doesn’t speak English.”\n\nLast Saturday, an anti-immigration protest organised on the other side of Dundee attracted a few hundred demonstrators, as well as counter-protesters, but passed off with no worse than angry chanting and egg-throwing.\n\nIn Lochee, there’s a genuine desire, says Tolland, to focus on inclusivity after the events of the summer. “Lochee is a place of immigration, from the Irish who settled here to work in the mills to the New Scots who came this century.\n\n“Some of us had a real fear that Elon Musk might spark some violence here, and it’s testimony to the people of Lochee that they didn’t take the bait. They should be proud they resisted.”"

Their hero has gone,” she said. “Telling the kids is and always will be the hardest thing I will do in my lifetime.”\n\nHis daughter Ella described him as “a good man driven by family and a pure love of life.”\n\nVeteran truck driver Platt was “genuinely remorseful” and “hating himself” for the trauma he had caused, his attorney, Stephen McNally, said.\n\n“Even though the defendant’s mobile phone was in a cradle and in front of him, this case provides an object lesson,” McNally said. “Even for the most experienced of drivers, not giving the road your undivided attention and concentration can have the most devastating consequences.”"

Sainz and Lawson capitalized on the misfortunes of others, securing second and third places on the grid, respectively, while championship leader Oscar Piastri failed to set a time due to a crash. The unpredictable conditions and potential for rain in the upcoming race present both drivers with a significant opportunity to improve their challenging seasons.",
        "source": "nytimes",
        "text": "Carlos Sainz and Liam Lawson sidled up next to Max Verstappen for the mandatory post-qualifying photo on Sunday, only to quickly be told to swap sides.\n\nAccording to Formula One protocol, the driver who finishes in second place stands to the right of the pole position driver, while the third-place finisher stands to the left.\n\nEither unused to the tradition or simply out of practice, Sainz and Lawson had stood, initially, in the wrong places. The drivers chuckled when they realized the error, before grinning at the flashing cameras ahead of them.\n\nIt summed up a chaotic qualifying session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, which featured a record six red flags, a series of crashes (including one for world championship leader Oscar Piastri) and even a sprinkling of rain.\n\nIt became a day for the underdog — one where Sainz and Lawson, two drivers whose 2025 seasons have been a struggle, seized the opportunity as the usual front-runners slipped up. Tomorrow’s race presents both drivers the chance to transform frustrating seasons into something altogether more memorable.\n\nThe first signs of a tricky day ahead emerged in final practice, when all the drivers struggled with large gusts blowing across the circuit. Baku, on the coast of the Caspian Sea, is known as the “City of Winds.” That made several corners hard for the drivers to predict in final practice. Modern F1 cars are so aerodynamically sensitive that even the slightest change in wind direction can have a big impact on their handling.\n\n“It’s completely unpredictable,” Sainz explained after qualifying. “A car in mid-corner depends purely on its downforce, and 30 to 40 kilometers per hour (of wind) changes the downforce of the car dramatically. That’s what we are getting every lap: a different level of downforce in the corner. It always catches people out.”\n\nQualifying proved challenging on a circuit renowned for its difficulty, with strong winds persisting throughout. Three red flags in Q1 alone after crashes for Alex Albon, Nico Hulkenberg and Franco Colapinto made clear this would be a session where keeping laps clean would be pivotal.\n\nLewis Hamilton found that out the hard way in Q2, when he ran wide on his first run and then found himself on the wrong tire for his final run near the end, causing him to drop out in 12th.\n\n“I honestly thought I was shooting for pole today,” Hamilton told Sky Sports. “It’s a bit of a shock.”\n\nBaku has always leaned into its history for chaotic races. Its official slogan is “expect the unexpected,” and the circuit’s marketing team even came up with the term “Baku syndrome” a few years ago to explain shock results in the past. As calling cards go for tracks, it’s a pretty good one.\n\nBut even by those standards, the final stage of qualifying on Saturday was still capable of shocks. The first was a crash for Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc at Turn 15. Leclerc had scored pole for each race in Baku since 2021, serving as one of his strongest tracks (even if he has not yet won). A lock-up at one of the toughest corners sent him straight into the barrier, ending his session early.\n\nBefore Leclerc’s crash, Sainz, Lawson and Isack Hadjar had all put in early lap times to fill out the top three under the red flag. Being one of the first to set a time in Baku comes with a risk, reducing the chance of a tow to improve top speeds from cars ahead, but it also ensures avoiding incidents behind that could ruin a qualifying.\n\n“You can start dancing to see if it rains a bit harder, no?” Sainz told his Williams team over the radio, watching the sprinkles of rain fall as the marshals cleared Leclerc’s car in the hope of a shock pole position. Heavier rain would make it nearly impossible for the faster cars to set competitive times, potentially gifting Williams its first pole since 2014.\n\nBut by the time the session resumed, the drizzle had given way to patches of blue sky. Regular service would surely return. Right?\n\nWrong. Moments before Verstappen was due to cross the line, a record sixth red flag emerged in qualifying for the driver least expected to have duffed his car into the wall: Piastri. The world championship leader had only made a single costly error up to now this year when he slid off the wet track in Australia. Now, with the championship gap to teammate Lando Norris at 31 points, he’d just ended his qualifying without a time on the board.\n\nWith Piastri ninth on the grid, it opened the door for Norris to take advantage. But with three minutes and 41 seconds on the clock, Sainz still had P1 — no one could set a time before the red flag.\n\nA seventh red flag would give Williams its first pole since Austria 2014.\n\nMcLaren played it safe and sent Norris out first, but he too made an error at Turn 15, glancing the barrier with his front-right wheel. It was gentle enough not to cause any damage, but it cost enough time that he couldn’t reach the pole — or even the front-runners, eventually sliding to seventh in the final classification.\n\nNorris told Sky after the session he thought it only cost him a couple of positions, the lap proving a challenge with rain remaining in the air.\n\n“I’m disappointed,” Norris said. “Of course I wanted more. Seventh feels like it hurts a bit, because that’s not normal for us.” His failure to truly capitalize on the first major Piastri error in six months, starting just two places further ahead, is the greater disappointment.\n\nIt was left to Verstappen to spoil the Williams party, the Dutchman inevitably keeping his cool where others had faltered. “In the end, it was only Max,” Sainz said. “It had to be Max.” But both Sainz and Lawson did improve on their final laps, clinching second and third place on the grid respectively, with Kimi Antonelli taking an impressive fourth amid his recent struggles.\n\n“I think I’ve lost three years of my life!” Williams team principal James Vowles told Sky Sports after the session. He explained how the team’s focus on making sure its tires were within the right range for qualifying, after struggling in recent races, had paid off. The drivers could push earlier for a quick lap.\n\n“We’ve nailed qualifying today, every time being on the right tire at the right time,” Sainz said. “The moment that a top car was going to put a lap together, we were going to be those four or five tenths behind, like we are always.”\n\nSainz’s first year with Williams has been something of a struggle. Despite largely matching teammate Albon for pace on a Saturday, his Sundays have tended to unravel, be it due to mistakes by the driver, the team, or sheer bad luck. The 54-point gap between the teammates does not tell the full story of their seasons.\n\nThis performance was a reminder of Sainz’s enduring quality and just what he can bring to Williams. He is still Ferrari’s most recent winner in F1, remember. Sainz knew Williams would be a long-term project, but grabbing this opportunity has fueled fresh hope of potentially standing on the podium much earlier than anticipated.\n\nWilliams has not had a podium since George Russell finished second at the 2021 Belgian GP. It’s the team’s only podium in the last eight years. “I’m going to give it my best to give Williams a first podium,” Sainz said. “If it’s possible, great. If not, we will see.”\n\nFor Lawson, third place was also a very timely result as Red Bull considers the composition of its two teams for 2026. The New Zealander has largely been in the shadow of rookie teammate Hadjar, whose podium at Zandvoort has made him the front-runner to be Verstappen’s partner from next year. Yet Lawson today delivered when it mattered. A return to Red Bull may be off the table, but it will be a big statement in making his case to keep his Racing Bulls seat for next year.\n\n“We just had a lot of stuff going on earlier in the year that was making qualifying more difficult,” Lawson explained. “It definitely wasn’t a strong point. So it’s important for me, more than anything. Obviously, it helps, these performances. But we need more than one. We need to keep the consistency.” Yuki Tsunoda, the other driver whose future is intertwined with Lawson’s, also used the chaos of Baku to qualify sixth, his best for Red Bull.\n\nWith rain possible for Sunday’s race, there is definitely potential for further mayhem — and opportunities — in Baku. Norris and Piastri will both have eyes forward, eager to recover from disappointing days, even if both were dismissive of their win chances given Verstappen’s pace so far this weekend.\n\nBut for Sainz and Lawson in particular, Sunday’s race offers both a huge opportunity to change the narrative of their seasons and turn today’s chaos into an even greater reward.\n\n(Top photos of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc: Kym Illman, Joe Portlock / Getty)"

        "article_summary": "Finland's President Alexander Stubb stated that security guarantees for Ukraine, being discussed by a coalition of European nations, would obligate those countries to respond militarily if Russia attacks Ukraine again. He emphasized that these guarantees must be credible and backed by real force, despite the uncertainty surrounding European political will to commit to such actions. Stubb also highlighted the importance of an \"American backstop\" for these guarantees, while expressing skepticism about the likelihood of a negotiated peace with Russia in the near future.",
        "source": "Guardian",
        "text": "Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, has said security guarantees for Ukraine, which are being discussed by the so-called “coalition of the willing”, would compel the European countries that sign to fight Russia if Moscow launched military action against Ukraine again in future.\n\n“Security guarantees in essence are a deterrent. That deterrent has to be plausible and in order for it to be plausible it has to be strong,” Stubb told the Guardian, in an interview in Helsinki before travelling to New York for the UN general assembly.\n\nHe said the guarantees would only come into effect after a future deal between Ukraine and Russia, but insisted that Russia would have no veto over their format.\n\n“Russia has absolutely no say in the sovereign decisions of an independent nation state … So for me it’s not an issue will Russia agree or not. Of course they won’t, but that’s not the point,” he said.\n\nAfter the Paris meeting last month, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, told reporters that 26 nations had committed to be part of a “reassurance force” in Ukraine, with some of them committing to be present “on the ground, in the sea or in the air”.\n\nHowever, the big question many in Kyiv have is whether the arrangements would come with concrete commitments. When asked if the guarantees would mean European countries were saying they would be ready to engage militarily with Russia in the case of future aggression against Ukraine, Stubb said: “That is the idea of security guarantees by definition.”\n\nIt is far from clear that there is political will for this kind of commitment in most European capitals, however, where promises to a postwar Ukraine have usually been framed more as “reassurance” than as firm commitments. Up to now, the policy of most western countries has been to offer support to Ukraine but minimise the risk of a direct conflict with Russia. But Stubb said any guarantees would be meaningless if not backed up with real force.\n\n“Security guarantees in essence are a deterrent and that deterrent has to be plausible, and in order for it to be plausible it has to be strong. And that means also strategic communication, so we’re not making security guarantees into the air, but we’re making real security guarantees and Russia knows that,” said Stubb.\n\nStubb has emerged as a key player in peace negotiations in recent months, forging a close relationship with the US president, Donald Trump, including through rounds of golf. The personal connection has meant that Finland, with a population of just 5.6 million, has been able to play an outsized role in communications between Trump and European leaders. Stubb said he and Trump are still in contact regularly, “by phone and other means” and that he expects the pair to have a bilateral meeting this week.\n\nStubb has said on several occasions this year that the US president was beginning to lose patience with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, but so far Trump’s occasional tough words on Putin have not translated into action, and a series of Trump-set deadlines for progress to be made on arriving at a peace deal have passed without much follow-up. Instead, Trump rolled out the red carpet for Putin in Alaska last month.\n\nStubb said he thought progress was being made, but “it’s not a big bazooka, it’s step-by-step”. On the question of whether there is a point when Europe has to accept that the US is not a reliable ally when it comes to Ukraine negotiations, Stubb said his nation had little option but to try as hard as possible to be friendly with the Trump administration.\n\n“I think it’s the job of the president of Finland to get along with the president of the United States, whoever he is,” said Stubb. “Foreign policy is always based on three pillars. It’s values, interests and power. Small states only have values and interests … but we can have influence instead of power. Engagement is better than disengagement, come hell or high water,” he added.\n\nLast week, Stubb was in Kyiv where he met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and said he came away from the trip “confident” that Ukraine could continue fighting a long war if necessary, dismissing suggestions to the contrary as “fake news”.\n\nStubb said much of the focus at the UN this week will be on Palestine, but that he hopes to have several meetings with Zelenskyy and others related to Ukraine. On security guarantees, he said an “American backstop” would be necessary to give them real force, and conceded that there is not yet a full sense of what the Trump administration is willing to commit.\n\nHowever, the talk of guarantees may all be purely hypothetical if progress is not made first on a negotiated end to the war. Zelenskyy has said many times he is willing to meet Putin, as demanded by Trump, but Putin has said he would only meet Zelenskyy in Moscow, or if numerous Russian demands are met first.\n\nStubb conceded that there did not currently appear much chance of bringing Putin to the table. “This war is too big for him to lose. He has made probably the biggest strategic mistake in recent history, certainly since the end of the cold war, and he has failed in all of his strategic aims. It’s a question when he comes to the negotiating table, hopefully sooner rather than later, but right now I’m quite pessimistic,” said Stubb."

Barring the semi-autonomous northern Kurdistan region of Iraq, the projects could potentially supply up to 20 percent of Iraq’s total electricity demand, according to the official.\n\nBut despite its massive oil and gas resources, Iraq continues to face – as it has for decades – electricity shortages rooted in war, corruption and mismanagement.\n\nNationwide electricity consumption peaked at about 55,000 megawatts this summer as scorching temperatures exceeded 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas.\n\nThis is while deputy minister Karim said the country is now producing up to 28,000 megawatts of electricity, including about 8,000 megawatts fuelled by natural gas imported from neighbouring Iran and fed to power plants in Iraq.\n\nThe critical supplies from Iran have faced many challenges over the years as well, particularly from unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States in an effort to pressure Tehran and squeeze its revenue streams amid a standoff over Iran’s nuclear programme and military capabilities.\n\nIn March, Washington announced it was ending a sanctions waiver that allowed Iraq to directly purchase electricity from Iran, which needed to be renewed every 120 days. The US has, for now, left another waiver in place that lets Iraq buy Iranian natural gas to feed its power plants."

        "text": "A Kenyan court this week ordered the arrest and extradition of a British national suspected of murdering a 21-year-old woman in a town close to a United Kingdom army training camp in Kenya in 2012.\n\nThe ruling has brought renewed attention to the long-running case of the young woman, Agnes Wanjiru, whose murder in Nanyuki, central Kenya, shook her community and sparked nationwide outrage.\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nlist of 4 items\n\nlist 1 of 4Murdered Ugandan Olympian Cheptegei buried with full military honours\n\nlist 2 of 4‘Will I be next?’: Fear haunts Kenyan women athletes after Cheptegei murder\n\nlist 3 of 4African manhood is broken – and it’s costing women their lives\n\nlist 4 of 4Kenya seeks British national’s arrest in septic tank murder\n\nend of list\n\nNanyuki community members have long accused British soldiers training in a garrison close to the town of gross misconduct; however, no suspects have been tried.\n\nIf the extradition goes ahead, it could mark the first time that a current or former British soldier will be extradited to face trial in another country for a civilian’s murder, according to the UK’s Guardian newspaper. In a statement, the UK government acknowledged the ruling and promised to cooperate with Kenyan authorities in the case.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Wanjiru’s family said on Tuesday they had waited “too long” for justice but hoped that it would now arrive, according to reporting by The Associated Press (AP) news agency.\n\n“While this is progress, it is not justice yet,” family spokesperson Esther Muchiri said.\n\nWhat happened to Agnes Wanjiru?\n\nTwenty-one-year-old Wanjiru worked as a hairdresser and a sex worker in Nanyuki, her hometown.\n\nOn the night of March 31, Wanjiru disappeared. Witnesses said she was last seen in the company of British soldiers on a night out at the Lion’s Court Lodge. The hotel is popular with British soldiers of the British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK), a permanent garrison in Nanyuki.\n\nTwo months later, on June 5, Wanjiru’s body was found in a septic tank located close to the hotel.\n\nShe had been beaten, stabbed, and was most likely still alive when she was thrown into the septic tank, a Kenyan magistrate said in a 2019 inquest. Wanjiru’s daughter, who was just a few months old, is now 13 and is being raised by her grandmother and an aunt.\n\nThe allegations against a British soldier came to light in 2021 when a Sunday Times investigation revealed that “Soldier X”, whom Wanjiru was last seen with, was believed to have stabbed her in the chest and abdomen. The soldier revealed his actions to colleagues and showed them where he dumped her body. At least one of them reported this to senior commanders at BATUK. It’s unclear if any action was taken.\n\nThe Sunday Times’ investigation revealed “Soldier X” and several others further poked fun at the murdered woman in Facebook posts.\n\nAttempts by her family to sue BATUK in Kenya were initially met with resistance because the British government, under the former ruling Conservative Party, claimed Kenyan courts did not have jurisdiction over UK troops. Following the Sunday Times exposé, however, the British government’s stance changed.\n\nA UK parliament vote in April 2023 amended security agreements between the two countries to allow for British troops to be tried locally in Kenya. In August 2023, the Kenyan government officially launched an inquiry into Wanjiru’s killing. Kenyan investigators are understood to have travelled several times to the UK since then to speak to witnesses.\n\nWhat did the court say?\n\nNairobi High Court Justice Alexander Muteti on Tuesday said there was “probable cause to order the arrest of the accused” and issued a warrant for “one citizen and resident of the United Kingdom”.\n\nThe court did not name the suspect, a move that family members of the late woman questioned.\n\nKenya’s office for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) said in a statement on X that “extradition proceedings would now be initiated to ensure the suspect is brought before a Kenyan court”.\n\n“Today, the DPP informed the High Court that evidence gathered links the suspect, a United Kingdom citizen, to the murder,” the statement read, adding that the extradition proceedings will be initiated.\n\nThe case will next be heard in court on October 21, 2025, the DPP said.\n\nWhat is BATUK?\n\nThe British Army Training Unit Kenya (BATUK) is a permanent training support force based on the outskirts of Nanyuki that has been operating since Kenya gained independence in 1963. Thousands of British infantrymen have passed through the BATUK training camp for exercises in harsh terrain.\n\nThe unit has some 100 permanent staff and about 280 rotating short-term regiments from the UK. British troops train there as well as Kenyan troops who are part of antiterrorism squads focused on the armed group al-Shabab in neighbouring Somalia.\n\nWhile the British soldiers’ presence has bolstered the local economy, there have been complaints about their conduct towards local people and the way they treat the local environment. Residents of Nanyuki complain of unexploded bombs that have detonated and maimed community members, and the presence of white phosphorus, a lethal chemical, left behind after training exercises. In one case in 2021, the chemical is believed to have started a large fire that damaged swaths of forest land.\n\nAllegations that the soldiers pay local women for sex are rife. In July 2022, the UK’s Ministry of Defence banned soldiers from using sex workers abroad as part of efforts to curb sexual exploitation and abuse. In an August 2024 report conducted by the British army into activities at BATUK, however, officials found that soldiers there were still using sex workers at a “low or moderate level”.\n\nWhat has the UK government said?\n\nThe British High Commission in Kenya reiterated earlier commitments that it would cooperate with Kenyan authorities on the case, but did not confirm or deny that an extradition request for the suspect had been issued, according to the AP.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, a spokesperson for the UK government, reacting to the ruling, said: “Our thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru and we remain absolutely committed to helping them secure justice.”\n\nThe spokesperson added: “We understand that the Kenyan director of public prosecutions has determined that a British national should face trial in relation to the murder of Ms Wanjiru in 2012.\n\n“This is subject to ongoing legal proceedings, and we will not comment further at this stage.”\n\nIn April this year, UK Secretary of Defence John Healey met with Wanjiru’s family and promised to help the family get “the justice they deserve”."

Their son Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was \"ecstatic and massively grateful\" to those who were involved in securing their release.\n\nThe Taliban, who detained the couple on 1 February, said the pair had broken Afghan laws and were released after judicial proceedings - but the Islamist group has never disclosed a reason for their detention.\n\nPeter and Barbie Reynolds married in Kabul in 1970 and spent the past 18 years running a charitable training programme that had been approved by local Taliban officials when the armed group reclaimed power in 2021.\n\nThere were emotional scenes on Friday as the couple's daughter, Sarah Entwistle, met her parents as they stepped off the plane in Doha.\n\n\"We are looking forward to returning to Afghanistan if we can. We are Afghan citizens,\" Barbie told Agence France-Presse at Kabul airport after Qatar-brokered negotiations for their release.\n\nTheir son Jonathan echoed those hopes, saying \"their desire would be to carry on living there and to do the work they were doing\".\n\n\"They have not just a heart for the people of Afghanistan, but they have strategy as well, and the work they've been doing has been very fruitful and has a massively positive impact,\" Jonathan told the BBC.\n\nHe said a few weeks ago he had managed to share the results of \"really encouraging\" reports about their programmes with his parents over the phone.\n\nHe said Barbie's initial reaction had been that they had \"more work to do\".\n\n\"But how do you do that in a country where you're not welcome,\" Jonathan added.\n\nSince 2009 the couple have been running training projects in Kabul and Bamiyan.\n\nOne of their education projects involved training women and children, and had apparently been approved by local authorities, despite a Taliban ban on women working and education for girls over 12-years-old.\n\nTheir affection for Afghanistan was demonstrated by their decision to remain in Bamiyan province after the authoritarian regime seized control in August 2021, while many other Westerners left - including most of their staff.\n\nThe couple's release follows months of public lobbying by their family, who have described the harrowing conditions of their detention.\n\nJonathan said in July that his father had been suffering serious convulsions and his mother was \"numb\" from anaemia and malnutrition.\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer praised the \"vital role\" played by Qatar in securing their release.\n\nA Qatari official told the BBC the couple were moved from Kabul's central prison to a larger facility with better conditions during the final stage of negotiations over their release.\n\nThe couple received medical checks in Doha before leaving for London.\n\nTaliban officials maintained they received adequate medical care during their detention and that their human rights were respected.\n\nThe UK does not recognise the Taliban government and closed its embassy in Kabul when the group returned to power.\n\nThe Foreign Office says support for British nationals in Afghanistan is therefore \"severely limited\" and advises against all travel to the country."

His house was destroyed nearly three weeks ago by the earthquake that has shattered the lives of thousands of others in this region.\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nlist of 4 items\n\nlist 1 of 4Afghan returnees struggle amid economic and climate crises\n\nlist 2 of 4‘My village is a graveyard’: Afghans describe devastation after earthquake\n\nlist 3 of 4‘Many never woke up’: Quake-hit Afghanistan’s villagers recount destruction\n\nlist 4 of 4Photos: Afghan quake survivors plead for help to rebuild homes\n\nend of list\n\n“We are living in tent camps now,” the 55-year-old farmer said, speaking at his cousin’s shop in the nearby village of Noorgal. “Our houses were old, and none were left standing … They were all destroyed by big boulders falling from the mountain during the earthquake.”\n\nDin’s struggle captures the double disaster facing a huge number of Afghans. He is among more than four million people who have returned from Iran and Pakistan since September 2023, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM).\n\nThe August 31 earthquake killed about 2,200 people and destroyed more than 5,000 homes, compounding a widespread economic crisis.\n\n“We lost everything we have worked for in Pakistan, and now we lost everything here,” Din adds.\n\nUntil four months ago, he had been living in Daska, a city in Pakistan’s Sialkot District, for eight years after fleeing his village in Afghanistan when ISIL (ISIS) fighters told him to join them or leave.\n\n“I refused to join ISIL and I was forced to migrate to Pakistan,” he explains.\n\nHis exile ended abruptly this year as the Pakistani government continues its nationwide crackdown on undocumented foreign nationals.\n\nHe describes how Pakistani police raided his house, taking him and his family to a camp to be processed for deportation. “I returned from Pakistan as we were told our time there was finished and we had to leave,” he says.\n\n“We had to spend two nights at Torkham border crossing until we were registered by Afghan authorities, before we could return to our village.”\n\nThis struggle is echoed across Kunar. Some 12km from Noorgal, in the village of Barabat, 58-year-old Sadat Khan sits next to the rubble of the home he had been renting until the earthquake struck.\n\nKhan returned from Pakistan willingly as his health was failing and he could no longer find work to support his wife and seven children. Now, the earthquake has taken what little he had left.\n\n“I was poor in Pakistan as well. I was the only one working and my entire family was depending on me,” he tells Al Jazeera. “We don’t know where the next meal will come from. There is no work here. And I have problems with my lungs. I have trouble breathing if I do more effort.”\n\nHe says his request to local authorities for a tent for his family has so far gone unanswered.\n\n“I went to the authorities to request a tent to install here,” he says. “We haven’t received anything, so I asked someone to give me a room for a while, for my children. My uncle had mercy on me and let me stay in one room in his house, now that the winter is coming.”\n\nOne crisis out of many\n\nThe earthquake is only the most visible of the crises that returnees from Iran and Pakistan are facing.\n\n“Our land is barren, and we have no stream or river close to the village,” says Din. “Our farming and our life depend entirely on rainfall, and we haven’t seen much of it lately. Other people wonder how can we live there with such severe water shortage.”\n\nDr Farida Safi, a nutritionist working at a field hospital set up by Islamic Relief in Diwa Gul valley after the quake, says malnutrition is becoming a major problem.\n\n“Most of the people affected by the quake that come to us have food deficiency, mostly due to the poor diet and the lack of proper nutrition they had access to in their village,” she explains. “We have to treat many malnourished children.”\n\nKunar’s Governor, Mawlawi Qudratullah, told Al Jazeera that the Kunar authorities have started building a new town that will include 382 residential plots, according to the plan.\n\nThis initiative in Khas Kunar district is part of the national programmes directed by the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing, with an objective of providing permanent housing for Afghan returnees. However, it is unclear how long it will take to build these new homes or if farmland will also be given to returnees.\n\n“It will be for those people who don’t have any land or house in this province,” Qudratullah said. “And this project has already started, separate from the crisis response to the earthquake.”\n\nBut for those living in or next to the ruins of their old homes, such promises feel distant. Back in Noorgal, Nawab Din is consumed by the immediate fear of aftershocks from the earthquake and the uncertainty of what comes next.\n\n“I don’t know if the government will relocate us down in the plains or if they will help us rebuild,” he says, his voice heavy with exhaustion. “But I fear we might be forced to continue to live in a camp, even as aftershocks continue to hit, sometimes so powerful that the tents shake.”"

The treaty aims to safeguard two-thirds of the world's oceans and up to 10 million species, establishing binding rules for conservation and sustainable use while relying on individual countries for enforcement.

        "text": "The first-ever treaty to protect marine diversity in international waters will come into force early next year, after it was ratified by the 60th nation, Morocco.\n\nMorocco’s formal adoption of the Marine Biodiversity Treaty on Friday means the agreement will now enter into force on January 17, 2026, offering new protections to an area covering two-thirds of the world’s oceans and as many as 10 million different species, many of which are still unidentified.\n\nRecommended Stories\n\nlist of 4 items\n\nlist 1 of 4Why have blue whales stopped singing?

Instead, it largely relies on individual countries to regulate their own ships and companies. If a ship flying a German flag violates the rules, for example, it’s Germany’s responsibility to act, said Torsten Thiele, founder of the Global Ocean Trust and an adviser on ocean governance and blue finance. That makes universal ratification essential, he said.\n\n“If somebody hasn’t signed up, they’ll argue they’re not bound,” he said.\n\nWhat are the High Seas?\n\nThe treaty covers international waters that fall outside any single country’s exclusive economic zone and account for nearly two-thirds of the ocean and nearly half of Earth’s surface.\n\nIt also covers what is known as “the Area”, shorthand for seabed and subsoil beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. That comprises just more than half of the planet’s seabed.\n\nNow that the treaty is law, a decision-making body, a Conference of the Parties (COP), will have to work with regional and global organisations that already oversee different aspects of the oceans, such as the International Seabed Authority.\n\nDeep-Sea mining risks\n\nOne aspect of the Marine Biodiversity Treaty is to ensure that countries can work towards more fair and equitable sharing of benefits from activities related to marine biodiversity beyond the borders of any one nation, as a handful of governments and companies push to rapidly expand deep-sea mining.\n\nEnvironmentalists say the potential consequences of dredging the ocean floor used to extract deep-sea minerals are difficult to calculate and range from endangering ancient lifeforms like dumbo octopuses and twilight zone corals to causing further distress to whales by distorting their sonar communication.\n\nAt least 38 countries are calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining until more is known about its potential harm to marine ecosystems, including those which have yet to be explored.\n\nThey include island states like the Marshall Islands and Vanuatu, as well as bigger countries like Brazil and the United Kingdom, while other countries, including the US under Trump, and the small Pacific island nation of Nauru, want to press ahead.\n\nInternational efforts continue\n\nThe Marine Biodiversity Treaty is the latest example of continued efforts to combat environmental threats at the global level, despite pushback from some governments.\n\nEarlier this year, countries at the UN shipping agency struck a deal on a global fuel emissions standard for the maritime sector, which will impose an emissions fee on dirty fuels and reward vessels that reduce their emissions.\n\nThe deal was reached after the US pulled out of the climate talks at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London and threatened to impose “reciprocal measures” against any fees charged to US ships.\n\nIn August, global talks to develop a landmark treaty to tackle plastic pollution failed to reach an agreement, amid deadlock at the sixth round of talks in under three years.\n\nBut in July, the UN’s highest court found that countries must meet their climate obligations, and that failing to do so could violate international law, potentially opening the door for affected nations to seek reparations in future legal cases.\n\nVanuatu’s minister for climate change, Ralph Regenvanu, who led the case at the International Court of Justice, reacted to the Marine Biodiversity Treaty entering into force, saying: “Everything that affects the ocean affects us.”"

Our oceans can't wait and neither can we,\" he added.\n\nOnce the treaty comes into force, countries will propose areas to be protected, and these will then be voted on by the countries that sign up to the treaty.\n\nCritics point out that countries will conduct their own environmental impact assessments and make the final decision - although other countries can register concerns with monitoring bodies.\n\nThe ocean is crucial for the survival of all organisms on the planet. It is the largest ecosystem, is estimated to contribute $2.5tn (£1.9tn) to world economies, and provides up to 80% of the oxygen we breathe."

        "article_summary": "China has advised Papua New Guinea against signing a defense treaty that could limit its ability to cooperate with other nations, following Australia's unsuccessful attempt to finalize a defense pact with PNG. The Chinese embassy emphasized that any treaty should not be exclusive or undermine PNG's sovereignty, as local politicians and military figures have voiced concerns about the potential impacts on the country's independence and decision-making. Despite the challenges, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese expressed hope for finalizing the agreement in the coming weeks, while critics urge caution and consideration of PNG's long-term interests.",

        "text": "China has urged Papua New Guinea not to sign a treaty that could restrict or prevent it from cooperating with another country, days after Australia failed to secure a defence pact with the Pacific nation.\n\nIn a statement on Facebook late on Thursday, the Chinese embassy in Papua New Guinea said it respected the country’s “right to conclude a bilateral treaty with other countries on a voluntary basis”.\n\n“However, such a treaty should not be exclusive in nature, nor should it restrict or prevents a sovereign country from cooperating with a third party for any reason. It should also refrain from targeting any third party or undermining its legitimate rights and interests.\n\n“We hope that the PNG side will continue to uphold independence and self-reliance, properly handle issues bearing on its sovereignty and long-term interests,” it said.\n\nThe statement comes after Australia and its former colony were expected this week to ratify the Pukpuk mutual defence treaty. But Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, left Port Moresby on Wednesday without signing the deal with his counterpart, James Marape. Instead, Albanese sealed a communique that laid out the wording of the pact after Papua New Guniea’s cabinet failed to agree to the deal.\n\nAlbanese said the text of the defence agreement had been confirmed but both governments had more work to do. If signed, the treaty is expected to lock the two countries into joint defence arrangements in the event of a military attack, and to allow citizens of both countries to serve in the defence forces of the other.\n\n“We will go through our respective cabinet processes and expect to finalise the signing of the treaty, the words of which have been agreed, in coming weeks,” Albanese told a press conference in Port Moresby on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian, politicians and several prominent ex-military figures in Papua New Guinea have expressed reservations about the defence deal, arguing that it could impinge on the country’s independence.\n\nThe leader of the opposition, Douglas Tomuriesa, said Papua New Guinea “needs strong partnerships but not at the cost of our constitutional authority, legal protections for our citizens or independent decision-making”.\n\nIn a statement, Tomuriesa said he welcomed cooperation to strengthen the defence force but any arrangement must contain safeguards and “review mechanisms to keep sovereignty intact”.\n\nRetired major general Jerry Singirok, commander of the Papua New Guinea defence force during the 1990s, described the treaty as a “violation” of the constitution. He noted that Papua New Guinea had an “important principle … of not being aligned to any countries in the face of threat”.\n\n“Because our foreign policy says that we are friends to all and enemies to none,” he said. “China is not a threat or enemy to Papua New Guinea. It’s [as] simple as that. This is the superpower rivalry in the region against smaller Pacific states.”\n\nFormer Papua New Guinea defence force (PNGDF) commander Maj Gen Gilbert Toropo agreed there were “competing interests in the region”. He said Papua New Guinea “stands in the crossroads of the region … where Papua New Guinea is going to be the playground for our big players”.\n\nToropo said Australia and Papua New Guinea should forge stronger ties, but not at the expense of his country’s “freedom to engage with other countries”.\n\n“As a sovereign nation, we should have the flexibility to reach out to the rest of the world for our prosperity,” he said, adding that every Papua New Guinean should be consulted and made aware of the treaty’s contents.\n\nPeter Ilau, PNGDF commander between 2001 and 2010, emphasised that Papua New Guinea could not compromise its sovereignty because of a “nice looking decree” that appeared to cover “all aspects of friendship, partnership, traditional friends”.\n\nAnalysts have also joined the call for the deal not to be rushed through, as former commander Singirok urged Papua New Guinea to consider alternative ways to strengthen the alliance.\n\n“We have a very good close relationship with Australia,” he said. “But I’m sure there are other ways to develop our capabilities without absorbing our military into the Australian army.”"

The Taliban have denied the claim.\n\nBut a BBC investigation - which examined 30 satellite images from late 2020 to 2025 - found very little activity at the base since the Taliban returned, and no evidence to support China's presence at the base.\n\nOn Friday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said \"China respects Afghanistan's territorial integrity and sovereignty\", adding that \"the future of Afghanistan should be in the hands of Afghan people\".\n\nThe Taliban's Zakir Jalal, meanwhile, wrote on social media platform X: \"Throughout history, Afghans have not accepted a military presence, and this possibility was completely rejected during the Doha talks and agreement, but the doors are open to other engagement.\"\n\nThe US and the Taliban have been involved in talks recently, although a meeting on Saturday with the Taliban's foreign minister focused on Americans held in Afghanistan, news agency Reuters reported."

Honey producers like José Antonio Bruña anticipate losing up to 50% of their production due to damaged flora, while livestock farmers have faced significant animal losses and increased insurance costs. The economic fallout is estimated at €600 million, with local businesses struggling to recover amid ongoing negotiations for government support.",
        "source": "BBC",
        "text": "3 days ago\n\nGuy HedgecoeBusiness reporter, Porto de Sanabria, north-western Spain\n\nJosé Antonio Bruña, a honey producer, is standing on a hillside where he keeps his beehives near the small Spanish village of Porto de Sanabria.\n\nHe points to the exact spot, a few hundred metres away on the mountain opposite, where lightning struck a few weeks earlier, igniting a wildfire that had disastrous consequences.\n\n\"This August has been a nightmare for me personally, but also for the local farmers and everyone here in the village,\" he says. \"I'm 47 and I've never seen a fire that fierce.\"\n\nIt ended up burning more than 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres) of land and causing thousands of people to be evacuated from villages in this farming-heavy corner of north-western Spain, near the Portuguese border.\n\nBut it was just one of several vast blazes which have devastated Spain this summer, burning 0.8% of the country's surface area.\n\nThe most heavily affected zones were here in the north-west, including the regions of Castilla y León and Galicia, plus the western region of Extremadura.\n\nHoney production, which is an important industry in rural north-west Spain, was one of the main casualties of the summer. Mr Bruña knows people who have lost up to 400 beehives in the fires.\n\nFortunately, his own 1,500 hives are intact, because the fire stopped just metres away from the fields where he keeps them. But the damage caused to nearby flora will have serious repercussions for his business.\n\n\"I calculate that this year I'm going to lose 50% of my honey production, at the very least, because of the fires, and the following year the same, or even worse,\" Mr Bruña says. This is because of the time it will take for the flowers that bees need to grow back again in surrounding fields.\n\n\"There are some types of flower that won't appear again for three years,\" he explains.\n\nThe lack of structural damage to his hives means he cannot claim insurance. He is considering moving many of them elsewhere, in the hope of improving the bees' chances of survival and reducing his future losses.\n\nMany livestock farmers have also been forced to move their animals in recent weeks, both to avoid fires and to ensure they can access unburned pasture.\n\n\"Things couldn't have been worse for farmers [this summer], it was one fire after another,\" says Fernando García, a cow farmer from Castromil, a village on the border between Castilla y León and Galicia.\n\nHe spoke after spending hours working with local volunteers and firefighters to bring under control yet another blaze, on the edge of the village.\n\nMr García has lost around 30 cattle this summer, most recently having to put down 11 animals which had suffered severe burns. At times, he has even kept his cows enclosed instead of letting them roam, because of fears about the fires.\n\n\"All of this has had a big economic impact, but the biggest impact of all is that we can't sleep at night,\" he says. \"It's a constant tension.\"\n\nAlthough farmers like Mr García expect to receive insurance payments, he believes there will be a knock-on cost.\n\n\"They may pay us, but next year, instead of costing us, for example, €5,000 [$5,858; £4,328], insurance premiums will cost €10,000 or €15,000,\" he says. \"Because insurance companies don't want to lose money.\"\n\nThe COAG national farmers' association estimated in August, when several large fires were still burning, that the industry had suffered damages worth at least €600m.\n\nThe biggest costs have been burned fields and properties and deaths of animals. However, there are other substantial damages, such as to beehives, and antennae used by farmers to locate their animals.\n\nFarmers' representatives are currently locked in negotiations with regional governments over how much public money should be paid out to help the sector recover.\n\nThe other main economic victim of this summer's fires has been tourism, which represents 13% of Spanish GDP and has been a motor of the country's strong recent growth.\n\nAlthough most of the coastal areas which are associated with tourism avoided fires this summer, the southern province of Cádiz was an exception as hotels, holiday homes and camping sites were evacuated because of blazes.\n\nAnd this summer's main wildfire hotspots, in the west and north-west, have developed rural tourism in recent years as an alternative to the beach holidays for which Spain used to be known.\n\nHiking is popular here, for example along the Camino de Santiago trail or in the area's mountain ranges, as is wine and food related tourism.\n\nSanabria Lake, the largest glacial body of water in the Iberian peninsula, is a major local attraction, surrounded by a natural park. But the spread of the fire that began in Porto de Sanabria in mid-August caused it to be shut down. And many tourists left the area, as smoke filled the air in nearby towns.\n\n\"In August, this area was at full capacity in terms of tourism and people who have second homes here,\" says Miguel Ángel Martos, the mayor of Galende, which is a few minutes' drive from the lake.\n\n\"And then, on 18 August, it dropped down to 10% of capacity.\"\n\nFor tourists this was inconvenient. But for many locals it spelled financial disaster. Among them was Óscar David García López, who has a contract to hire two bar-restaurants on the shores of the lake.\n\nHe estimates that during the second half of August, when the local authorities closed down the lake, he lost €80,000, because of the rental of the bars, the wages and social security payments of his 14 employees, and the food which he had bought but which could not be sold.\n\n\"The regional government has said it will pay me €5,500,\" he says, laughing bitterly at the thought. \"They are going to have to come up with some other kind of compensation because I didn't want to close, they forced me to.\"\n\nThe Hosteltur, a news platform that reports on the tourism industry, warned that the damage caused by the wildfires in such areas \"is not limited to the material impact, but also the impact on the image… of these destinations\".\n\nThis summer has underlined the now-infamous schism between urban and rural Spain. Decades of migration from rural areas, such as those hardest hit by this summer's fires, to urban hubs means that 90% of the Spanish population now inhabits just 30% of its territory.\n\nThe rest has become known as la España vacía, or \"empty Spain\", where a sparse population has often complained about a lack of infrastructure, transport links, and schools, as well as the imposition of EU environmental and sanitary regulations for farmers.\n\nThe fires, which have been particularly uncontainable this year, only compound that discontent.\n\nIn Castromil, local man Miguel Ángel García Diéguez summed up the feelings of many people in rural areas who have watched the wildfires in horror this summer.\n\n\"It's hard enough as it is to survive because of the price of animal feed and fuel – every day it's more difficult for farmers to get by,\" he says. \"And then on top that, this happens.\""

        "text": "Indonesia will ban the construction of new hotels and restaurants built atop cleared rice fields and agricultural land on the popular resort island of Bali, after recent flash flooding killed at least 18 people.\n\nA state of emergency was declared on Bali on 10 September after the island experienced the most severe flooding in more than a decade.\n\nTriggered by heavy rainfall, the flooding caused extensive damage to homes, public facilities and infrastructure and affected thousands across Denpasar and its surrounding areas.\n\nEnvironmental activists have long sounded the alarm about the impacts of mass tourism on the island, saying stricter controls to prevent land conversion would reduce the risks from flooding and other natural disasters.\n\nIn the wake of the floods the Bali governor, Wayan Koster, said this week that new rules had been issued.\n\n“Starting this year, yes, there is already an instruction to all heads of districts and mayors across Bali,” he said on 14 September.\n\n“After handling the floods, we will meet again to ensure no more permits are issued for hotels, restaurants or other facilities on productive land, especially rice fields,” he said, as quoted by Indonesia’s state news agency, Antara.\n\n“Starting this year, the land conversion ban will align with Bali’s 100-year plan. From 2025 onward, no productive land can be converted into commercial facilities.”\n\nFamous for its lush, green rice paddies and stunning beaches, the “island of the Gods” has undergone rapid change over the past half-century with locals and tourists complaining about the traffic, pollution and badly behaved foreigners that have come with the hotels and resorts that now swamp the island.\n\nIndonesia said last year that it would place a moratorium on new hotels amid fears of overdevelopment, but the plan failed to eventuate. The new bylaws are expected to be brought into effect by the end of 2025.\n\nThe move follows a warning from Indonesia’s meteorology and climate agency about the potential for an extreme rainy season this year, and a worsening waste crisis that has aggravated flooding in several regions, including Bali.\n\nFlooding is common in Indonesia during the wet season, which typically runs from September to March.\n\nHowever, scientists say the climate crisis is intensifying the rainy season, bringing heavier rainfall and more frequent flash floods. Overdevelopment and widespread deforestation are believed to be worsening the impact of flooding.\n\nIndonesia’s environmental minister, Hanif Faisal Nurofiq, said after the floods that the new bylaws were an important step for the island.\n\n“This is also crucial for Bali’s tourism as the recent flooding has drawn serious attention,” he said.\n\n“I actually told the governor last week that I really hope he will immediately stop the land conversions in Bali. This is extremely important.”\n\nExtreme rainfall is more common and more intense because of human-caused climate breakdown across most of the world, particularly in Europe, most of Asia, central and eastern North America, and parts of South America, Africa and Australia.\n\nThis is because warmer air can hold more water vapour. Flooding has most likely become more frequent and severe in these locations as a result, but is also affected by human factors, such as the existence of flood defences and land use."

Despite the sensationalism, experts caution that these stories often unfairly place blame on women, while the men involved face little accountability.",

        "text": "How a man's affair with his mother-in-law became a viral film in Indonesia\n\n18 hours ago\n\nKoh EweSingapore and\n\nRiana IbrahimBBC Indonesian, Jakarta\n\nFor months, Indonesian movie audiences have been talking about one film: Norma, the story of a seemingly blissful marriage shattered by the husband's clandestine affair with his mother-in-law.\n\nIt's the kind of plot that was always going to attract melodrama fans. But what has made Norma a nationwide obsession is the fact that it's based on a viral true story.\n\nIn 2022, Norma Risma, a woman in Serang City on Indonesia's Java island, exposed her husband and mother's affair in a TikTok video.\n\nHer story quickly racked up millions of views, made headlines and ultimately brought her a movie deal that has taken South East Asia by storm.\n\nNorma, which hit Indonesian theatres in March and Netflix in August, soon became one of the most watched movies, not just in Indonesia but also Malaysia and Singapore, where there are large Malay-Muslim populations.\n\nIt also follows a winning formula that Indonesian filmmakers have discovered: adapting viral social media scandals.\n\nUntil this June, Indonesia's highest-grossing film of all time was KKN di Desa Penari, a 2022 horror story about the haunting of six university students, which came from a popular thread on X. In 2023 came Sewu Dino, another horror flick adapted from a story shared by the same X account.\n\nEqually popular are tales of a more salacious persuasion: Ipar Adalah Maut, a 2024 Indonesian movie about an affair between a man and his sister-in-law, was marketed as a true story adapted from a TikTok video. The 2022 drama series Layangan Putus, about a family torn apart by a cheating husband, also got its inspiration from TikTok.\n\nSuch themes are highly taboo in Indonesia, where adultery is punishable with jail time. The country's new criminal code, set to take effect nationwide next year, outlaws sex outside marriage - and in its most conservative province, couples are already publicly flogged for premarital sex.\n\nBut in this culture of religious conservatism, experts say, a voyeuristic interest in household scandals thrives.\n\nWith the help of social media, stories that had mostly been limited to neighbourhood gossip now make for viral \"pelakor\" content, a slang term for homewrecker and an oft-used keyword in videos of wives confronting their husbands' mistresses.\n\n\"With films about these scandals, people are given a space to peek into someone else's household problems,\" SM Gietty Tambunan, a member of the Jakarta Arts Council Film Committee, tells BBC Indonesian.\n\n\"Especially because of that conservative culture, people are becoming even more curious.\"\n\nA taste for scandal\n\nVero, a 42-year-old housewife in Jakarta, has been following Norma's story since it went viral on TikTok. It made her \"furious with the husband and mother\", she tells BBC Indonesian.\n\n\"When I knew this story was being made into a movie, I wanted to see how cruel these two people were to Norma,\" she says.\n\nIn the cinema she cried at the movie's climax, when Norma weaved through a crowd outside her house to find her half-dressed husband and mother in the room.\n\nThe tender scenes of Norma's husband and mother resisting and then realising their romance has both scandalised and captured viewers.\n\n\"Surely after filming this they will feel sick,\" a TikTok user commented on a scene where the pair kissed. In the film, a friend who discovers the pair's illicit relationship vomits when she catches them in the act.\n\nMs Gietty warns that these narratives have a dangerous tendency to put the blame mostly on women rather than the cheating men. In these feuds between the legitimate spouse and the illicit lover, \"the man tends not to receive any punishment,\" she says.\n\nBut what sets the film Norma apart is the involvement of the protagonist herself in the creative process, the film's screenwriter Oka Aurora tells BBC Indonesian. She is also behind the script for Ipar Adalah Maut and Layangan Putus, the two other TikTok-inspired productions.\n\nAfter intense discussions with Norma about her feelings and her mother's backstory, the film's \"core story remains broadly consistent\", says Oka, though she added that there were \"definitely certain parts that were dramatised to play with the audience's emotions\".\n\n\"This film is also a way for people to release emotions and have fun. So when they leave the cinema, there are things they feel and talk about.\"\n\nLife for Norma\n\nToday, the real Norma works as an outsourced worker in Serang, her hometown.\n\nHer mother, Rihanah, has returned home to live with the family after an eight-month prison stint for adultery. Rozy, Norma's ex-husband, was sentenced to nine months in jail.\n\nDuring a press appearance for the film in February, Norma said she was encouraged by the messages she had received from other victims of cheating spouses.\n\n\"When I experienced [the affair], I thought, 'Why am I being cheated on by the person closest to me? Am I the only one experiencing this?' It turns out that when I spoke up, many people had experienced the same thing,\" said Norma."

        "article_summary": "Norway is experiencing a \"golden age\" in filmmaking, gaining international acclaim with distinctive, relationship-focused films and television shows, such as Dag Johan Haugerud’s \"Dreams\" and Joachim Trier’s \"Sentimental Value.\" This resurgence is attributed to a new generation of filmmakers who are encouraged to take creative risks, fostering a unique cinematic identity that sets them apart from their Nordic neighbors. Despite challenges in financing and the influence of streaming platforms, Norway's state investment in film and the professionalization of its industry are contributing to its growing prominence on the global stage.",
        "source": "Guardian",
        "text": "When it comes to film-making, Norway has long been left watching on while its Nordic neighbours Sweden and Denmark put out hit after hit by luminaries such as Lars von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg and Ruben Östlund.\n\nBut after years in the shadows, the country has finally found its place in the international spotlight with a number of distinctive, relationship-centred and critically acclaimed films and television shows in what many are describing as a Norwegian “golden age”.\n\nThe last few months alone have seen the release of Dreams, the third of Dag Johan Haugerud’s Oslo Stories Trilogy, which won the biggest prize at this year’s Berlin film festival; Joachim Trier’s Sentimental Value, which was awarded the Grand Prix at Cannes and comes off the back of his Oscar-nominated The Worst Person in the World; Lilja Ingolfsdottir’s Loveable; and Armand, the directorial debut feature from Halfdan Ullmann Tøndel.\n\nMeanwhile, Pernille (known as Pørni in Norway) has found dedicated audiences around the world since the Viaplay comedy drama series about the life of a single-parent family was recommissioned by Netflix.\n\n“We are in a golden age of Norwegian cinema,” Ullmann Tøndel, who is working on the script for his next film, told the Guardian. “Especially in terms of recognition from the biggest festivals and how Norwegian cinema films are being perceived outside of Norway.”\n\nAlthough there has been no shortage of talented Norwegian film-makers – including Trier and Haugerud – on the whole, Ullmann Tøndel said, films coming out of Norway had generally been “quite safe”. This was not the case, he said, among the younger generation, many of whom have formed a collective to encourage and inspire one another to take risks and have fun. Others to break through recently with their directorial debuts include Emilie Blichfeldt, with The Ugly Stepsister, and Thea Hvistendal, with Handling the Undead.\n\n“What is so great is that all of us have a very different visuality. That’s a really important thing in Norwegian cinema,” said Ullmann Tøndel. “Because in Sweden for example, everybody tried to make Ruben Östlund films for a while and in Denmark everyone tried to make Lars von Trier films for a while. So we really try to nurture our own singularity.”\n\nIf there is a face of this new wave, then it is almost certainly the unvarnished expressions of Renate Reinsve, who can be found collapsing into seven minutes of laughter in Armand and finding her way through the micro-details of romantic relationships in all their joy, pain, awkwardness and humour as she did in the 2021 hit The Worst Person in the World.\n\n“She is so intuitive and smart, and goes very deep into her roles, but she does it with a lightness,” said Ullmann Tøndel, adding that she is also very funny. “She has a remarkable understanding, it seems, of what makes us human.”\n\nNorway’s newfound international stature in the film world has not gone unnoticed by its neighbours.\n\n“It hurts to admit it because of our countries’ eternal rivalry, but Norway is light years ahead of Sweden in terms of cultivating original cinematic voices,” said Kristoffer Viita, an author and film critic for the Swedish broadcaster SVT.\n\nWhile Viita takes some consolation from the fact that Ullman Tøndel’s grandfather – the legendary director Ingmar Bergman – was Swedish, he is not sure that the young Norwegian director would have been able to follow his same path in Sweden, where the film industry is focused mainly on Swedish audiences.\n\nHenriette Steenstrup, who wrote and starred in Pernille, said that as a Norwegian she had not expected her series to be an international success – because of the specifically Norwegian society it showed. Unlike Nordic noir’s focus on crime and detectives, her series focused on everyday subjects such as family and loss. “There is a lot of drama in everyday life,” she said.\n\nWhile it is easier to make films in Norway than in many other countries, with consistent state funding and a steady flow of talent emerging from free-of-charge film schools, film-makers are coming up against growing difficulties in getting their projects financed.\n\n“Norway is a big hub of talent,” said Hege Hauff Hvattum, one of the producers of the Oslo Stories Trilogy. “The money from the Norwegian Film Institute (NFI) has been good in the sense that many projects have been realised with a mix of Nordic funding alone, but it’s not been increased at the same speed as the costs, so we’re starting to wonder how it will be in the future. Especially since the streamers are not doing as much drama and films and TV series as they did, that’s an issue.”\n\nThere was also the problem of streamers seeking to make films more appealing to wider audiences, which Hauff Hvattum said could result in making them generic. “If you want to tell a story that is honest and precise, I believe that is easier if you write out of a local perspective to capture the nuances – it’s more interesting,” she said.\n\nKjersti Mo, the CEO of the NFI, said Norway’s success was the product of long-term state investment in film-making – about 670m NOK (£50m) this year – and the professionalisation of its film industry in terms of working with international partners.\n\nThe NFI tries to help independent film-makers in the way it structures their financing, by making it dependent on theatrical release and owning their own rights. “We have to empower our creatives and producers so that they still have a choice,” said Mo. “In the ecosystem the money from the streamers still matters but we will not let them design everything.” The NFI’s job, she said, was to “empower the art side” of film-making.\n\nContrary to an overall move towards dumbing down, Mo said that increasingly, films selected by the institute for their artistic merits were also the ones that were popular among audiences. “That makes me really happy. We are building awareness in the Norwegian population so they are proud of the films and proud of the film-makers.”\n\nNorway, she said, had always been “the little brother or sister” to Denmark and Sweden when it came to film. “They are mostly happy for us,” Mo said. “I think it is also an inspiration.”\n\nBut Sarah Iben Almbjerg, the film editor at the Danish newspaper Berlingske, said it would not be long before Danish film was “back in the international limelight”. She added: “Until then, the Norwegians can enjoy their place in the sun.”"

        "text": "A two-year-old drowned in a vehicle that was swept away by flood waters in southern California, and the child’s father had to be rescued by authorities, officials said Friday.\n\nThe deadly emergency unfolded amid sudden heavy rain east of Los Angeles that unleashed mudslides which plowed into homes and trapped drivers for hours on roadways.\n\nThe two-year-old boy who drowned was in his family’s vehicle when it was swept off the road by flood waters Thursday night in Barstow, according to a statement from the city. The boy’s father was separated from his son as they were both swept away by the water, and the father was later rescued, according to officials. The boy’s body was found Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, near the San Bernardino national forest, authorities rescued 10 people traveling in at least six vehicles who were stranded on state route 38 in the area of Jenks Lake, the local fire district said. The route is narrow and winds through towering trees, curving back and forth up the mountainside and linking cities east of Los Angeles with the resort town of Big Bear Lake.\n\nChristopher Prater, a public information officer for the San Bernardino county fire protection district, said no one was hurt in the area of Jenks Lake, and no one is reported missing.\n\nThe mudslides affected the tiny mountain communities of Forest Falls, Oak Glen and Potato Canyon, the county’s fire protection district said in a statement. One home in Forest Falls had giant tree trunks flung in its yard and piled so high they reached the roof.\n\nForest Falls was walloped by mudslides three years ago. That was just two years after wildfires ripped through the area, leaving burn scars, or areas where there is little vegetation to hold the soil.\n\nIntense rains pounded the area for more than an hour Thursday afternoon as remnants of Tropical Storm Mario reached the mountainous region, the US’s National Weather Service (NWS) said.\n\nKael Steel told KNBC-TV he was driving down the mountain from Big Bear to head to an amusement park when the rain started pounding.\n\n“Suddenly we started seeing rocks and stuff coming down the side of the mountain,” he said.\n\nSteel said cars were turning around telling him the road was blocked. So he headed back up the mountain but was blocked again. He turned around once more and said the road he had crossed 30 seconds earlier had been wiped away.\n\n“There’s no road there any more,” he said.\n\nThe route was still closed as of Friday, the California Highway Patrol (CHP) said.\n\nAuthorities planned to assess the hillside areas affected by the slides to determine the extent of the damage.\n\n“The community obviously has been impacted fairly significantly,” Prater said. “How bad, we don’t know yet.”\n\nWith the possibility of more storms forecast for Friday, San Bernardino county fire officials asked residents to stay alert, and an evacuation warning was in effect for mountain communities already affected by Thursday’s storm. By Friday evening, the evacuation warning had been lifted, the San Bernardino county sheriff’s office said in a post on X.\n\nForest Falls saw 1.5in (3.8cm) of rainfall in an hour, and another half inch (1.3cm) after that – far more than the arid southern California region usually sees, said Kyle Wheeler, a meteorologist for the NWS in San Diego.\n\nThe rain also fell much faster, Wheeler said, adding that the rainfall rates for summer thunderstorms in the region are more typically about a half inch (1.3cm) per hour.\n\n“They got almost two inches of rain in a two-hour time period,” Wheeler said. “The fact that it happened in such a flood-prone location is just an unfortunate event.”"

The brigade's flag is pinned up behind him.\n\nThe aspiring long-distance runner says he was tricked into joining the Russian army and is desperate to go home to see his 16-year-old daughter.\n\nIn a Facebook post accompanying the video, the 57th Separate Motorised Infantry Brigade said it was an example of how Russia treats foreign recruits but added that he had \"fought on the side of the enemy, so whether to believe the words and tears is up to your discretion\".\n\nThe brigade said the interview was filmed with Kibet's consent, but the BBC has not verified this. Though recruits from abroad in the Russian army are not unheard of, this is a rare case of a captive foreigner speaking on video.\n\nCitizens of Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba and Sri Lanka , among others, are currently held in Ukrainian prisoner-of-war camps, Petro Yatsenko, Ukraine's spokesperson on the treatment of prisoners of war, told the BBC.\n\n\"Most of these individuals come from poorer countries and end up on the Russian side in different ways. Some are deceived – promised jobs at factories – while others join the war voluntarily. It is important to understand that very few are captured alive; most are either killed or seriously injured,\" he added.\n\nBack in Kenya, Kibet's family and friends are in shock over what they have seen.\n\nAfter a heavy sigh and a long pause, his cousin Edith Chesoi told the BBC that she had been replaying the video over and over in her head.\n\n\"I am so traumatised. I didn't sleep at night. I don't even know what to say.\"\n\nKibet's younger brother, Isaac Kipyego, described him as \"humble guy and a man with a few words\" as well as a pillar and advisor to the rest of the family.\n\nThey know him as someone dedicated to his sport.\n\n\"I love running, I love running,\" Kibet says on the Ukrainian video. And it was this that may have led him to becoming an unwitting Russian recruit.\n\nKibet had built his life around athletics, a sport that has lifted many Kenyans like him from villages to global recognition.\n\nHe grew up in a farming family from the Mount Elgon area in western Kenya.\n\nKibet trained in Iten, the high-altitude town famed for producing Olympians and world champions, but in a competitive field he never reached that status. Instead, he competed in lesser-known 10km and half-marathon road races in Europe and Asia, according to family and friends.\n\n\"Kibet has been running since he was a child,\" his younger brother said. \"He's always been talented. Running was his life.\"\n\nBut while the sport defined his identity, it had not delivered the financial breakthrough he longed for.\n\nFriends say Kibet had been struggling financially.\n\nIn March, he asked a training partner, Elias Kiptum, to help him race in Poland, but the team that was going was already full.\n\n\"I guess that's how he ended up in Russia,\" Kiptum told the BBC.\n\nWhen, later in the year, a sports agent offered him a trip to Russia to take part in races, Kibet seized the opportunity. The BBC's calls to the agent to confirm this have not been picked up.\n\n\"He was very excited when he told me he was going to race in Russia,\" Kibet's brother said. \"Even I was happy for him. We had high expectations.\"\n\nHis cousin, Ms Chesoi, who escorted him to the bus park on the first leg of the journey at the end of July, said he carried just \"a small-sized suitcase\".\n\nKibet told his family he would only be gone for two weeks.\n\nOn the video filmed in Ukraine, Kibet says that he went to Russia as a visitor and not for a \"military job\".\n\nThen, after a fortnight, his host asked him if he would like to stay longer.\n\n\"I said: 'Yes, but the problem is that my visa is expired'. He said: 'No, I can do something for you.'\" And then he promised Kibet a job.\n\n\"In the evening, he came with some papers written in Russian. He told me: 'This is the job I want you to do.'\n\n\"I didn't know it was a military job.\"\n\nKibet says he then signed the papers and the man took his phone and passport.\n\n\"And that is how everything went wrong... that signing ruined my life.\"\n\n'Either you fight or we'll kill you'\n\nAccording to Kibet, some other people turned up and told him to get in a car. They then drove for around seven hours.\n\n\"I found myself in a military camp.\"\n\nKibet says he was informed that he had signed up to be in the army and that he had no choice.\n\n\"I was told: 'Either you go to fight or we'll kill you.'\"\n\nHe says a week of basic training followed, during which he was shown how to handle an automatic rifle. None of his commanders spoke English, so instructions came through shoves and gestures.\n\nKibet insists he never engaged in combat and then on the way to what would have been his first mission, he ditched his equipment and escaped, wandering for two days through a forest near Vovchansk in Ukraine's north-eastern Kharkiv region.\n\nHe then approached some Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n\"I went there with my hands up,\" he says repeating the gesture for the camera.\n\n\"I said: 'I am a Kenyan, please don't shoot me.'\n\n\"Everyone pointed their guns at me, but I told them to calm down. The commander came, they tied me. I told them: 'No, I am unarmed, I don't want anything. I'm here to save my life.\"\n\nDespite Kibet's family being in shock over the video, there is some relief that he is in the hands of the Ukrainians.\n\n\"We feel that he's a bit safe [with them] rather than being in Russia,\" his brother Mr Kipyego said.\n\nThe family is asking the Kenyan authorities to intervene. The ministry of foreign affairs has not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\n\"If the government of his country of origin expresses interest in his repatriation, Ukraine is open to negotiations about transferring him home,\" Ukrainian spokesperson Mr Yatsenko said.\n\nHowever, speaking about other prisoners-of-war, he added that \"most African states show little interest in the return of such citizens and do not wish to take them back\".\n\nFor Kibet's loved ones, their only priority is his safety.\n\n\"If he made a mistake, let them forgive him. We only want him back,\" his brother said.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGo to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafrica"

        "article_summary": "Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old woman who has lived in the U.S. for over three decades, was arrested by ICE after her multiple asylum applications were denied. Her family reported her distressing statement from detention, expressing a desire to die rather than remain in the facility, prompting outrage from the Sikh community and local officials who criticize the targeting of peaceful immigrants. Despite her long-standing presence and contributions to the community, ICE stated they are enforcing a judge's removal order, while her family seeks her release and travel documents to return to India.",
        "source": "BBC",
        "text": "The visiting room of the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Centre in Bakersfield, California, is small, loud, and crowded. When Harjit Kaur's family arrived to see her, they could barely hear her - and the first words they caught shattered them.\n\n\"She said, 'I would rather die than be in this facility. May God just take me now',\" recalled her distraught daughter-in-law, Manjit Kaur.\n\nHarjit Kaur, 73, who unsuccessfully applied for asylum in the US, and has lived in California for more than three decades, was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials on 8 September, sparking shock and sympathy from the Sikh community across the state and beyond.\n\nHarjit Kaur had filed several asylum appeals over the years which were rejected, with the last denial in 2012, her lawyer said.\n\nSince then, she had been asked to report to immigration authorities every six months. She was arrested in San Francisco when she had gone for a check-in.\n\nIt comes amid a wider crackdown by the Donald Trump administration on immigration, and especially alleged illegal immigrants in the US.\n\nThe issue is a sensitive one - the country is grappling with how to deal with the hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers who arrive at its borders every year. More than 3.7 million asylum cases are pending in immigration courts. An increased budget for immigration enforcement means ICE is now the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency.\n\nTrump has said he wants to deport the \"worst of the worst\", but critics say immigrants without criminal records who follow due process have also been targeted.\n\n\"Over 70% of people arrested by ICE have no criminal conviction,\" said California State Senator Jesse Arreguin in a statement demanding Harjit Kaur's release. \"Now, they are literally going after peaceful grandmothers. This shameful act is harming our communities.\"\n\nUS Congressman John Garamendi, who represents the Californian district where Harjit Kaur lives, has submitted a request to ICE for her release.\n\n\"This administration's decision to detain a 73-year-old woman - a respected member of the community with no criminal record who has faithfully reported to ICE every six months for more than 13 years - is one more example of the misplaced priorities of Trump's immigration enforcement,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nIn an emailed statement, ICE told the BBC that Harjit Kaur had \"exhausted decades of due process\" and that an immigration judge had ordered her removal in 2005.\n\n\"Harjit Kaur has filed multiple appeals all the way up to the Ninth Circuit Court of appeals and LOST each time. Now that she has exhausted all legal remedies, ICE is enforcing US law and the orders by the judge; she will not waste any more US tax dollars,\" it added.\n\nTrump orders increase in migrant deportations\n\nIndia 'will do what's right' on illegal immigration - Trump\n\nHarjit Kaur came to the US in 1991 with her two minor sons after the death of her husband, her lawyer Deepak Ahluwalia told the BBC. Her daughter-in-law Manjit Kaur said that the young widow wanted to shield her sons from and escape the political turbulence in India's Punjab state at the time.\n\nOver the next three decades, she worked modest jobs to raise her sons, one of whom is now a US citizen. Her five grandchildren are also US citizens.\n\nHarjit Kaur, who lives in Hercules city in the San Francisco Bay Area, was working as a seamstress at a sari store for the past two decades and pays her taxes. Asylum applicants across the US are allowed to live, work and pay taxes legally once their claim is officially filed and in process.\n\nEven after her final asylum appeal was rejected in 2012, her job permit was renewed every year.\n\nAfter the rejection, her deportation seemed imminent, but she didn't have the right documents to travel to India.\n\nIndian missions in the US issue emergency certificates - a one-way travel document - to Indians of invalid status to enable them to return. This would require verifying Harjit Kaur's origin and identity in Punjab through photos, cross-checking with relatives or acquaintances or finding old records, which would take at least a few weeks.\n\nMore than a decade since the rejection, neither Harjit Kaur nor US immigration officials have been able to get a travel permit for her. Manjit Kaur said they visited the Indian consulate in San Francisco in 2013 for this but didn't succeed. India's Consul General at San Francisco K Srikar Reddy told the BBC they had no record of Harjit Kaur applying for travel documents to India.\n\nICE did not respond to a question about why it did not get a travel permit in the past 13 years.\n\nMr Ahluwalia said he is following up with the Indian consulate for the documents which \"ICE was unable to procure for the last 13 years\". The consulate says they are \"facilitating all necessary consular assistance\".\n\nHarjit Kaur's family, meanwhile, say she never questioned her deportation and should not have been detained.\n\n\"Provide us the travel documents and she is ready to go,\" Manjit Kaur said. \"She had even packed her suitcases back in 2012.\"\n\nRight now, their immediate concern is getting her out of the detention centre.\n\n\"You can put an ankle monitor on her. We can check in with immigration when you want,\" said Manjit Kaur. \"Just get her out of the facility and when you provide us the travel documents, she will self-deport to India.\"\n\nHer lawyer said that when he met Harjit Kaur on 15 September, she had not been provided with her regular medication. He alleged that she had been \"dragged by guards\", \"denied a chair or a bed\" and was \"forced to sit on the floor\" for hours in a holding cell despite having undergone double knee replacement.\n\nHe also alleged that she was \"explicitly refused water\" and not provided a vegetarian meal for the first six days.\n\nICE did not respond to specific questions on these allegations, but had earlier told BBC Punjabi that \"it is a long-standing policy that as soon as someone comes into ICE custody, they are given full health care\".\n\nDetainees have access to \"medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care\" and no-one \"is denied essential care at any time during detention\", it added.\n\nKulvinder Singh Pannu, president of the gurdwara committee at The Sikh Centre in San Francisco Bay Area, says that Bibi Harjit (a respectful way to refer to an elderly Punjabi woman) is well-liked in the area.\n\n\"She always helped people in our community with whatever she had financially,\" he said.\n\n\"A couple of hundred people turned up by themselves to protest against her arrest,\" he said, referring to a 12 September agitation outside the Sikh temple in California.\n\nAs the uncertainty continues, Harjit Kaur's supporters are planning to hold more protests, including in other US cities, with many saying they are touched by her plight.\n\nA single mother, Harjit Kaur had formed deep roots and relationships in the US over the past 30 years. Her parents and siblings in India are no longer alive, says Mr Ahluwalia.\n\n\"She has no-one, no home, no land to return to.\"\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube,Twitter and Facebook."

Chen was sentenced to 15 years in prison on 22 August.\n\n“These executives turned a Chinese chemical company into a pipeline of poison, shipping hundreds of kilos of fentanyl-related precursors into the United States, disguising them as everyday goods, and cashing in through cryptocurrency,” Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) chief Terrance Cole said in a statement.\n\nWang and Chen were among eight Chinese nationals and four Chinese companies charged by the justice department in June 2023 with trafficking fentanyl precursor chemicals into the US.\n\nIt was the first time the United States had charged Chinese companies for trafficking fentanyl precursor chemicals inside the United States, rather than shipping them to Mexico, the origin of most of the fentanyl found in the country.\n\nFentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times more powerful than heroin and much easier and cheaper to produce. It has largely replaced heroin and prescription opioids such as oxycodone as a cause of overdoses in the United States.\n\nThe June 2023 indictment of the Chinese executives and companies drew protests from Beijing.\n\n“It is completely illegal and seriously damages the basic human rights of Chinese citizens and Chinese companies,” the Chinese foreign ministry said at the time. “China strongly condemns this.”\n\nAlthough Mexico has been the main source of fentanyl sold in the United States, Washington has increasingly focused its attention on China-based suppliers of ingredients."

We also have a gas heater in the kitchen, and he said that can emit carbon monoxide. Is that true? With summer coming up – should I stop using our reverse cycle airconditioning. What should I use instead!? Melbourne can get putrid during the hot months. What’s the safest way to stay warm and cool without risking my health? – Carla, 42, Dandenong VIC\n\nANSWER: Dear Carla, thanks for your question. Melbourne’s four-seasons-in-a-day climate means our heaters and airconditioners work overtime but do they put our health at risk? Let’s clear it up.\n\nAir-conditioners and legionella\n\nLegionella is the bacteria behind Legionnaires’ disease, a severe pneumonia. It thrives in stagnant warm water that gets dispersed as a mist, which is why outbreaks are linked to cooling towers, spas and fountains. Your reverse-cycle split system doesn’t store water, so it isn’t a breeding ground. The main risk at home is dust, mold and allergens in dirty filters, which can flare up asthma or hay fever. Regular cleaning fixes this.\n\nGas heaters and indoor air quality\n\nGas is a different story. Unflued or poorly maintained heaters can release carbon monoxide, which is a colourless, odorless gas that at high levels can be deadly. Even at lower levels, long-term exposure is harmful. Gas appliances also produce nitrogen dioxide, which research has repeatedly linked to asthma flares in children and lung irritation in adults. Health authorities and peer-reviewed studies both point to this as a measurable risk.\n\nThe good news: a properly flued and serviced heater, in a ventilated room, is much safer. But if yours is old, unflued, or hasn’t been checked in years, get it inspected. And a carbon monoxide alarm is a smart investment.\n\nHow to stay safe\n\n• Stick with reverse-cycle airconditioning. It’s efficient, safe and low-pollution when serviced.\n\n• Retire unflued or very old gas heaters.\n\n• Install a carbon monoxide alarm.\n\n• Ventilate when using gas appliances.\n\n• Insulate and draught-proof to reduce how hard your systems need to work.\n\nCarla, this means you can keep using your reverse-cycle without worrying about legionella. Focus on your gas heater because that’s where the real evidence points to risk.\n\nWarmly (or keep cool) – Dr Zac!\n\nGot a question? Email askdrzac@drzac.com.au"

        "article_summary": "Jameson Williams scored a 44-yard touchdown against the Bears by exploiting the Lions' offensive tendencies established throughout the game. The Lions set up this play by conditioning the Bears to expect routes over the middle, then executed a double post concept that caught the defense off guard, allowing Williams to run untouched into the end zone. This strategic play exemplified the Lions' ability to capitalize on defensive expectations built over time.",
        "source": "nytimes",
        "text": "Did you see Jameson Williams score an untouched 44-yard touchdown against the Bears on Sunday?\n\nHow did that happen?\n\nWilliams’ score was a long-con by the Lions offense — a tendency-breaking play they set up over the course of the game.\n\nLet’s take a look at a couple of plays from the first half. The first comes with three minutes left in the first quarter.\n\nAmon-Ra St. Brown and Sam LaPorta are lined up next to each other tight to the left side of the formation. LaPorta takes off up and crosses the field on an over route, occupying the middle of the field underneath the defender, while St. Brown snaps his route off into the void created by LaPorta’s clearout route.\n\nThis is a staple concept and philosophy for the Lions offense: clear out the middle of the field and let Jared Goff rip it.\n\nGoff does just that and sticks the ball right in St. Brown’s chest for an easy completion.\n\nFast forward to the early second quarter, and we’ll see the Lions try something similar, this time from the right side of the formation.\n\nSt. Brown and Williams line up in an offset stack set to the right side on this third-and-10, with St. Brown again serving as the outside receiver. Williams runs a true vertical clearout route down the seam, keeping the safety high and pulling the underneath defender up the seam to create a 1-on-1 window for St. Brown.\n\nThe opening is there, in theory, but Bears cornerback Jaylon Johnson anticipates the dig from St. Brown and undercuts the route. Just a sick play by the defender — those guys get paid too!\n\nFinally, the Williams touchdown — the big payoff.\n\nThe Lions have spent all game, and really all of the Goff era, conditioning teams to anticipate and break on routes over the middle. On the Williams touchdown, they abuse that to their advantage.\n\nRight before the snap, the Lions motion Kalif Raymond in from the outside to be the new inside receiver, making Williams the outside receiver. Rather than working the middle, however, the Lions run a double post concept: a perfect beater to the Bears’ quarters coverage.\n\nRaymond’s shallower post route occupies the safety on the hash, keeping him low in coverage. That gives Williams his 1-on-1 with cornerback Nahshon Wright, who, at this point in the game, has to be waiting on a stop route or a dig route to come. Williams instead keeps on trucking right past him and straight into the end zone completely untouched.\n\nShot plays in the NFL are all about lulling defenses into anticipating the wrong play and hitting them with something else.

And I’m like, ‘You were doing a really good job. You were doing a really good job in a really hard role.'”\n\nAlong with Radnor, the series also starred Neil Patrick Harris as Barney, Cobie Smulders as Robin, Jason Segel as Marshall and Alyson Hannigan as Lily.\n\nThe CBS project instantly became a cult classic, even spearheading the spinoff, “How I Met Your Father” in 2022. The sitcom lasted two seasons and ended in 2023.\n\n“How I Met Your Father” starred Hilary Duff, Francia Raisa, Chris Lowell and Suraj Sharma.\n\nSmulders, 43, and Harris, 52, were also featured on the show.\n\n“And it’s like whatever boot I had on my own neck around it has kind of released,” Radnor continued on the pod, “and I’ve just been like, ‘Oh, I get why people love this show. I get why they’re connected to my character.’ Like I’ve been able to look at it much more compassionately and kind of almost like, I love this thing.”\n\nDespite being open to revisiting that time in his life now, there was a period where the podcast host tried to distance himself from the character.\n\n“In some ways, I always ran things through a bit of a ‘How I Met Your Mother’ algorithm in terms of, is this far enough away from the tone of the show. I was really looking for roles that just felt really different,” Radnor told People in Feburary. “It’s tiring to run from such a big part of yourself and your career.”\n\n“I think that part of me doing this [rewatch podcast] is just to almost call a truce with it and say like, ‘All right, you’ve given me a lot. You’ve taken a lot from me. I don’t want to be at odds with you, so let’s just turn around and see.’ I think there’s something that will be psychologically healthy for me about it, to re-engage at this age.”\n\nIn May, Segel, 45, shared how working on the long-running sitcom made balancing his movie career difficult.\n\n“The way my life was for about six years was I would be shooting ‘How I Met Your Mother,’” he said on the Hollywood Reporter’s “Awards Chatter” podcast. “And during that time, I would be writing a movie that we would then shoot on the four months off and get done in time to get back to ‘How I Met Your Mother.’”\n\n“And it was an amazing time. It was an electric time. But I also was getting a little tired and I was starting to not enjoy myself so much,” admitted Segel. “And that was a bummer because I was doing such cool things.”"

        "article_summary": "In the latest episode of *Peacemaker* Season 2, the titular character, played by John Cena, chooses to enter an alternate dimension, leaving his friends to find a way to bring him back. The cast hints that the final three episodes will be even more intense and transformative, featuring significant character developments and plot twists that could impact the broader DC Universe. Viewers are encouraged to prepare for a wild ride as the season progresses.",
        "source": "NYPost",
        "text": "If you thought that the first five episodes of Peacemaker Season 2 were wild, get ready, because the cast says things are only about to get weirder.\n\n**Spoiler alert: this article contains details about Peacemaker Season 2 Episode 5**\n\nAt the end of the newest episode of James Gunn and John Cena‘s anti-hero HBO Max series, the titular character (Cena) is faced with a decision and opts to enter a different dimension, one where his brother Keith (David Denman) and dad (Robert Hammond Patrick Jr.) are still alive. He closes the portal behind him, however, leaving his friends to have to figure out some way to try and find him and bring him home.\n\nChatting with DECIDER about Season 2, the actors behind some of the fan-favorite characters on the show shared that while spoilers are strictly off limits, viewers should ready themselves for a wild ride that will leave their jaws on the floor.\n\n“Oh, good luck. There’s literally nothing we can say, which is why they only showed you the first five. A lot of times they’ll show press like all the episodes, but 6, 7 or 8 are massive. There’s literally nothing we can — I mean, we can’t tell you that I die,” joked Steve Agee, who plays ARGUS agent John Economos. “The episodes go so hard in the last three. Yeah, I would be afraid to even say anything.”\n\nDenman, who made his Peacemaker debut in the Season 2 opener, said that for him, the final three episodes are about the connection that his character has with his on-screen brother, and getting to watch Cena transform and show his more dramatic side.\n\n“Well, I can’t speak to 6, 7, and 8. All I can tell you is it gets really good. It gets better and better and better,” he teased. “John is such a dream to work with. He’s such a gentleman, he’s such a pro, he’s very kind and giving. We had to do a lot of very intimate scenes where he had to get pretty emotional […] It was really amazing to watch John’s work in this because I don’t know that he’s been asked to do this type of stuff and roles that he’s played in the past.”\n\nSol Rodriguez, the Argentinian-born actress behind the role of Sasha Bordeaux, added that for her recently unveiled superhuman character, the final three episodes are “wild” and feel “like a movie.” She told DECIDER that there’s so much that happens in Episodes 6, 7, and 8 — which will release on the streaming service weekly through October 9 — but that she can’t share too many details about what is coming just quite yet.\n\nWhile Episode 5, “Back to the Suture,” revealed that her character’s comic-book cyborg storyline is now canon to the DC Universe, fans will be surprised by the direction that Sasha’s arc goes in. Rodriguez also explained that it has major implications for the future of Peacemaker and DC projects, including potentially the next Superman film.\n\n“I feel like one of the things for my character is that my loyalty is absolutely and definitely tested, and she will have to make some decisions and see where she lies and what aligns with her values within her career, her job, and her life,” she shared of what’s ahead for Sasha in the last three episodes of Season 2.\n\nFans will just have to tune in and see how Sasha Bordeaux and the rest of the crew figure out how to bring Peacemaker back from the alternate dimension, how things shake out, and — possibly most importantly — how it all sets up the DC Universe for Man of Tomorrow.\n\nThe first five episodes of Peacemaker Season 2 are now streaming.\n\nIf you’re new to HBO Max, you can sign up for as low as $9.99/month with ads, but an ad-free subscription will cost $16.99/month. If you subscribe via Prime Video, you can also take advantage of a seven-day free trial."

There’s too many dogs in perilous situations and rescuing costs too much for me to be leaving money on the table,” Tillia, 38, told The Post.\n\nBefore this, the sexy brunette would do “solo stuff, girl girl stuff” and content with her husband.\n\nIn the last two weeks, she released three X-rated videos on OnlyFans with men other than her husband — and is making a pretty penny, and has already earned close to $19,000.\n\n“At this time, my first with another man besides my husband is projected to make more than what I used to make in an entire year as a teacher,” said Tillia, who earned an annual salary of $36,000 as a special ed teacher.\n\nUntil last month she was telling The Post she was not ready to do the dirty with men on camera, although her fans were begging for it.\n\n“I don’t do content with other men at this time,” she said. “I’m not there.”\n\nTillia runs the nonprofit, Minnie’s Mutts, with her husband of 12 years, Nick, and the couple has already rescued 50 dogs from being euthanized since they launched in April.\n\n“We’re paying for a lot of it out of our own pockets.

        "text": "This woman used ChatGPT to cash in for her good deeds.\n\nIn a remarkable story of generosity and gratitude, a woman who recently won the lottery has announced that she plans to donate every penny to charity.\n\nCarrie Edwards, a resident of Midlothian, Virginia, matched four of the first five numbers plus the Powerball in the September 8 Virginia Lottery drawing, leading to a sizable windfall.\n\nWhile the initial prize was $50,000, Edwards had opted to pay an extra dollar for the Power Play option, which tripled her winnings to $150,000.\n\nEdwards, who isn’t a frequent online lottery player, revealed that she used to her phone’s ChatGPT app to pick her numbers. “I’m like, ChatGPT, talk to me… Do you have numbers for me?” she recalled during a press conference.\n\nTwo days later, Edwards was sitting in a meeting when a notification on her phone stopped her in her tracks: “Please collect your lottery winnings.\n\nAt first, she thought it was a scam. “I thought, ‘I know I didn’t win,’” she said. But after verifying the news, she was in for a life-changing surprise.\n\n“As soon as that divine windfall happened and came down upon my shoulders, I knew exactly what I needed to do with it. And I knew I needed to give it all away, because I’ve been so blessed, and I want this to be an example of how other people, when they’re blessed, can bless other people,” she said.\n\nTrue to her word, Edwards has pledged to divide the full $150,000 among three causes close to her heart.\n\nThe first charity on her list is the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD), an organization that supports research into a disease that claimed the life of her late husband in 2024. Frontotemporal degeneration causes early-onset dementia and has left a profound impact on her life.\n\nEdwards’ second donation will go to Shalom Farms, a regenerative farm based in Richmond that focuses on food justice and community-driven solutions to food insecurity. “It’s the greatest organization, because they understand that — when it comes down to it — we all are responsible for helping each other in this life and helping the community, and helping those who don’t have what we have. [It’s] something that they are focused on through their food justice and food equity program,” she said.\n\nThe final organization on her list is the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, which Edwards said is “very near and dear to her heart.” Her father, a fighter pilot, supported the society throughout his life, and she is continuing his legacy by donating to it.\n\nAs Edwards prepares to give away the money, she emphasized how blessed she felt to be in a position to help others. “Because it’s a windfall I didn’t expect, and it’s certainly going to help those in need,” she said.\n\nHer story is a testament to the power of generosity, showing that even unexpected windfalls can be used for the greater good. While many may dream of a lottery win to change their own lives, Edwards is proving that sometimes, the most meaningful way to spend newfound wealth is by giving it away."

        "article_summary": "A study involving African and American researchers has identified key genetic adaptations that enable the Turkana pastoralist community in northern Kenya to thrive in extreme environmental conditions characterized by heat and water scarcity. The research, which sequenced 367 genomes, found that several genes, particularly STC1, have evolved to aid survival, including coping with dehydration and a purine-rich diet. As some Turkana people transition to urban living, the same genetic adaptations may increase their risk of chronic diseases, highlighting the challenges of \"evolutionary mismatch\" in changing environments.",
        "source": "Guardian",
        "text": "A collaboration between African and American researchers and a community living in one of the most hostile landscapes of northern Kenya has uncovered key genetic adaptations that explain how pastoralist people have been able to thrive in the region.\n\nUnderlying the population’s abilities to live in Turkana, a place defined by extreme heat, water scarcity and limited vegetation, has been hundreds of years of natural selection, according to a study published in Science.\n\nIt shows how the activity of key human genes has changed over millennia and the findings place “Turkana and sub-Saharan Africa at the forefront of genomic research, a field where Indigenous populations have historically been underrepresented”, according to Charles Miano, one of the study’s co-authors and a postgraduate student at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri).\n\nThe research sequenced 367 whole genomes and analysed more than 7m genetic variants, identifying several regions of the genome under natural selection. It was conducted through the Turkana Health and Genomics Project (THGP), an initiative bringing together researchers from Kenya and the US, including Kemri, the Turkana Basin Institute (TBI), Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe genomic analysis found eight regions of DNA that had undergone natural selection but one gene, STC1, expressed in the kidneys, showed exceptionally strong evidence of humans adapting to extreme environments. Evidence included the body’s response to dehydration and processing purine-rich foods such as meat and blood, staples of the Turkana people’s diet.\n\nTurkana stretches across a large swathe of northern Kenya, one of the most arid regions in the world, where shade is scarce and water even more rare. Rainfall arrives in short, unpredictable bursts, and securing enough water for themselves and their herds of cattle, goats and camels is a daily chore. Fetching water can involve journeys of many hours each day across hot terrain devoid of vegetation.\n\nAbout 70% to 80% of the community’s diet comes from animal sources, mostly milk, blood and meat, reflecting resourcefulness and adaptation to scarcity, which is common among pastoralist societies around the world living in environments where crops cannot grow and where markets are too far away to be accessed on foot.\n\nYet, after years of documenting the Turkana people’s lifestyle and studying blood and urine samples to assess their health, researchers found that, although the community consumes too much purine, which should lead to gout, the condition rarely appears among the Turkana.\n\n“About 90% of the people assessed were dehydrated but generally healthy,” said Prof Julien Ayroles, from the University of California, Berkeley, one of the project’s co-principal investigators. “The Turkana have maintained their traditional way of life for thousands of years, providing us with an extraordinary window into human adaptation.”\n\nGenetic adaptations are believed to have emerged about 5,000 years ago, coinciding with the aridification of northern Africa, the study suggesting that as the region became drier, natural selection favoured variants that enhanced survival under arid conditions.\n\n“This research demonstrates how our ancestors adapted to dramatic climate shifts through genetic evolution,” said Dr Epem Esekon, responsible for Turkana county’s health and sanitation sector.\n\nHowever, as more members of the Turkana community move to towns and cities, the same adaptations that once protected them may now increase risks of chronic lifestyle diseases, a phenomenon known as “evolutionary mismatch”. This occurs when adaptations shaped by one environment become liabilities in another, highlighting how rapid lifestyle changes interact with deep evolutionary history.\n\nWhen the researchers compared biomarkers and gene expression – the process by which information encoded in a gene is turned into a function – in the genomes of city-dwelling Turkana people with their kin still living in the villages, they found an imbalance of gene expression that may predispose them to chronic diseases such as hypertension or obesity, which are more common in urban settings where diets, water availability and activity patterns are radically different.\n\n“Understanding these adaptations will guide health programmes for the Turkana, especially as some shift from traditional pastoralism to city life,” said Miano.\n\nAs the world faces rapid environmental change, the Turkana people’s story offers inspiration and practical insights. For generations, the researchers said, this community has developed and maintained sophisticated strategies for surviving in a challenging and variable environment, knowledge that becomes increasingly valuable as the climate crisis creates new survival challenges.\n\nFor close to a decade, the project centred on co-production of knowledge, combining genomic science with ecological and anthropological expertise. The agenda emerged from dialogue with Turkana elders, scientists, chiefs and community members, conversations about health, diet and change, often in the evening around a campfire.\n\n“Working with the Turkana has been transformative for this study,” said Dr Sospeter Ngoci Njeru, a co-principal investigator and deputy director at Kemri’s Centre for Community Driven Research. “Their insights into their environment, lifestyle and health have been essential to connecting our genetic findings to real-world biology and survival strategies.”\n\nDr Dino Martins, director of the TBI, says the deep ecological connection and the adaptation to one of the Earth’s hottest and most arid environments provides lessons for how climate continues to shape human biology and health. “The discovery adds another important piece of knowledge to our wider understanding of human evolution,” he said.\n\nResearchers say other pastoralist communities in similar environments in east Africa, including the Rendille, Samburu, Borana, Merille, Karamojong and Toposa, are likely to share this adaptation.\n\nThe research team will create a podcast in the Turkana language to share the study’s findings and also plan to offer the community practical health considerations that arise from rapidly changing lifestyles."

As Jake attempts to raise funds to cover Vince's debts, tensions rise among the staff, particularly with Roxie, who demands Vince's departure or she will leave. The episode culminates in a fundraiser where Vince's selfish behavior is highlighted, leading Jake to face a moral dilemma about protecting his brother at the cost of his own integrity and the wellbeing of their employees.",
        "source": "NYPost",
        "text": "Already, this is what it’s come to. What Jake Friedken will do for his brother Vince. Episode 3 of Black Rabbit (“Skin Contact”) has him standing before the bulletproof glass of a pawn shop, peeling off his watch and cashmere sweater to scrounge cash for the week’s Mancuso payment. Yes, Vince’s pinky finger was also sliced away to serve the debt. But every day his brother’s back in New York, Jake is cutting away pieces of his own life to support him. For as maddening as Vince can be as a character – Really, dude? You were drunk, high on coke, and challenged an employee to jump off the roof of the Rabbit with you, then chickened out, only for that guy to fall to the street and become paralyzed? More on that in a second – watching Jason Bateman and Jude Law interpret the deep contours of this sibling relationship is Black Rabbit’s biggest and best feature. Jake will be clouded with anger at Vince in one moment, then smile to himself at his brother’s chiding the next. They’ve probably been doing this same dance since they were little kids.\n\nJake’s latest flash: a fund-raiser at the restaurant for “high school kids,” or something – it’s really to generate the quick cash they both need. Jake’s gambling debt, but also to “make the books whole,” as Naveen demands. Nothing can move forward with Jake’s Pool Room pitch without a tip-top Black Rabbit ledger. At the market, Roxie and assistant chef Tony (Robin de Jesús) grouse about Vince’s return. They’re developing a menu and putting in labor just to help this asshole? He nearly killed a Rabbit employee. Tony says they’re also enabling Jake’s addiction. To his brother.\n\nThis episode’s non-linear moment is a flashback to two years before, and the morning after Vince reneged on his cocaine-fueled roof-jump pact with Trevor (Michael Patrick Thornton), a Black Rabbit staffer. Bailed out of jail, Vince learns the man became paralyzed from the fall, and also learns he’s being bought out of the Rabbit to cover Jake and Naveen’s $500,000 settlement. Trevor won’t sue and they’ll move on, but not with Vince. The restaurant Vin angrily says he started? “You’re burning it to the ground.”\n\nRoxie cannot coexist with Vince back in the picture. She shares what Anna told her about Jules, says they need to do better at protecting their employees, and demands the artist – a friend of Wes’s – be permanently banned. Her second demand hits Jake harder. Vince is out, or she is. Jake’s protest – “But he’s my brother” – is both painfully true and profoundly cowardly.\n\nThe night of the fundraiser illustrates this. Trevor arrives in his wheelchair, invited by Roxie, and instead of showing any kind of remorse, you can see Vince plotting some kind excuse or deflection for what he did to this guy. Trevor tells the story of what happened to a group of staff, and holds Vince’s stare. It’s another challenge between them, and Vince is again looking out for himself.\n\nThe entire evening at the fundraiser, Jake has hesitated to do what he promised Rox. And the more he waffles on pushing Vince out, the more his brother walks around the VIP bragging that he’s back for good. Worse, Jules shows up with Wes, who didn’t listen to Jake’s weak protests not to bring him. The two are drinking heavily at the event when Jules latches onto Mel, the Rabbit’s hostess, and feeds her bad drugs. The young woman nearly ODs right there in the bar, and despite Vince having seen the whole thing, he lies to Jake that he didn’t.\n\nJake is in the security room, his finger hovering over the “Delete” button. The footage captures Jules with Mel, and from a few days before, shows him dosing Anna’s drink. Jake is facing the possibility of a police investigation, and direct evidence of his not protecting his employees, but is considering a course of self-preservation. Or Friedken-preservation; if he deletes the footage it would be another something cut away to protect and support Vince.\n\nWith EMS outside the Rabbit, Jules rolls up in his hired car, collects Wes and Estelle, and they skedaddle. This is another suggestion of the growing divide between Wes and Jake as friends, but howabout an even more apparent cue? While Mel was nearly overdosing on Jules’ drugs, Jake and Estelle were outside on the street, marvelling over her Pool Room designs. The new project reminds them both of working together on the Rabbit build-out. They sit closer. There are quiet smiles. And two seconds later they’re making out.\n\nHe just sucks up so much oxygen, Jake said of Vince back in Black Rabbit Episode 1. That also goes for this series itself.

        "article_summary": "Wyoming's disappointing performance against Utah last week ended hopes for a perfect betting season, as they failed to cover a 23.5-point spread despite a strong first half. Temple, coming off a heavy loss to Oklahoma, is set to face Georgia Tech and is viewed as a potential undervalued underdog due to their recent improvements under new head coach K.C. Keeler. Despite past struggles, the betting staff believes Temple could perform better than expected in this matchup, making them a compelling pick at +23.5.",

        "text": "We were dealt our first blow last week as Wyoming collapsed after holding Utah to just three points in the first half. Not covering a 23.5-point spread after going into the break down 3-0 is a tough break, but that’s why we call these picks “Ugly Underdogs.” Our dreams of a perfect season are over, but we’ll try to get to 3-1 with the Temple Owls on Saturday.\n\nThe Post’s betting staff had a meeting this week and during the small-talk portion of the powwow, one colleague revealed he bet Temple against Oklahoma last weekend.\n\nI’m paraphrasing, but this intrepid bettor summed up the experience thusly: “Every time I tuned in, Temple was doing something bad.”\n\nSounds like a ringing endorsement for a play on the Owls this weekend against one of the early darlings of the college football season, Georgia Tech.\n\nThere’s no getting around it: Temple was overmatched by Oklahoma in Week 3.\n\nThe Sooners raced out to a 28-3 lead at the half, and then took their foot off the pedal en route to a 42-3 shellacking. Temple tallied just 104 yards of offense and averaged 1.9 yards per play. Not great, Bob.\n\nBut here’s the important bit: It turns out that Oklahoma is very good.\n\nTemple vs. Georgia Tech odds, prediction\n\nThe Sooners have been shot out of a cannon to start the season, and quarterback John Mateer has established himself as an early Heisman frontrunner. The defense has been humming too.\n\nNobody is going to bump Temple up in their power rankings after getting routed, but don’t let a blowout loss against one of the best teams in the country hide the fact that the Owls look like an improved bunch under new head coach, K.C. Keeler.\n\nBetting on College Football?\n\nCheck out the best College Football betting sites\n\nRead our expert’s guide on how to bet on College Football\n\nGet the latest College Football National Championship winner odds\n\nThere’s no reason to throw a parade for beating UMass and Howard by a combined score of 97-17, but it’s also important to remember where Temple was coming from before this season started.\n\nThe Owls went 3-9 in 2024 and finished the campaign ranked as the 127th-best team in the country according to Bill Connelly’s SP+ rankings, a catch-all metric that holds considerable respect in the college football world.\n\nIt’s early days, but Temple currently sits No. 98 in SP+.\n\nThis is a decent jump considering this is Year 1 under Keeler, who just finished a tremendous spell at Sam Houston State.\n\nBefore that, Keeler turned Delaware into an FCS juggernaut, laying the foundation for the Blue Hens to join the FBS this season.\n\nHe wins everywhere he goes, and I’ve got no doubt he’ll have Temple turned around sooner rather than later.\n\nThat doesn’t mean you should expect Temple to give Georgia Tech a run for its money Saturday, but this game does have all the right ingredients for a market overreaction.\n\nGeorgia Tech is in a letdown spot after a seismic win over Clemson, Temple is coming in off a blowout loss, and the Yellow Jackets have become a romantic story after spending years in the college football wilderness.\n\nThis may sound like a bad idea after Temple failed to cover a big spread against the Sooners, but the Owls should profile well as a pesky underdog this season.\n\nThey’re in the early throes of a rebuild, but Keeler is a master at getting programs heading in the right direction, and I have faith that Temple will give a decent account of themselves as a 23.5-point underdog at Bobby Dodd Stadium on Saturday.\n\nBET: Temple +23.5 (-108, DraftKings)\n\nWhy Trust New York Post Betting\n\nMichael Leboff is a long-suffering Islanders fan, but a long-profiting sports bettor with 10 years of experience in the gambling industry.

The CEO, Stephen Rue, expressed deep sadness over the fatalities, which included an eight-week-old baby, and acknowledged that the company failed to escalate reports of the outage when two customers alerted them. The federal government has announced an investigation into the incident, which has raised serious concerns about Optus's handling of emergency services and communication with authorities.",
        "source": "Guardian",
        "text": "A fourth person died during Optus’s network outage on Thursday, its CEO has confirmed.\n\nStephen Rue said in a statement released on Saturday afternoon that the telco was “saddened to learn of a new fatality in Western Australia, which appears to have occurred during the outage period”.\n\n“I am deeply saddened by this further news and extend my heartfelt condolences to the person’s family and friends,” he said.\n\nIt comes after Optus confirmed the emergency calls were offline for nearly 14 hours, during which four people died – including an eight-week-old baby. Two deaths occurred in South Australia and two in WA.\n\nRue said that WA police advised Optus that they believed the “individual likely attempted to contact triple zero for assistance”, adding that the company would work with authorities to “understand more of what has occurred”.\n\nThe CEO earlier confirmed that two customers had called Optus during the outage on Thursday to warn the telco that triple zero calls were not working, but the complaints were not escalated.\n\nRue told reporters on Saturday afternoon: “We now know we were informed by two individuals that they could not connect into triple zero, and this information was not surfaced with the relevant escalation at that time.”\n\n“Early review suggests that we had not handled these calls as would be expected,” he said.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, said triple zero calls were out of action for 10 hours – eight hours longer than Optus initially claimed – but Rue confirmed on Saturday afternoon the timeframe was more than 13 hours.\n\nThe CEO confirmed the planned technical upgrade began at 12.30am on Thursday but was cut short at 1.50pm after the telco was notified by SA police that there was an problem.\n\n“Once notified, we stopped the upgrade, restoring triple zero, and began to confirm with relevant stakeholders, such as police and other regulatory and government agencies and departments that we had experienced an outage impacting triple zero,” he said.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nRue said Optus commenced welfare checks, and during which it learned three people had died during the outage.\n\n“Once we had this information and were confident of its accuracy, we shared this with our board, with the ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority), the federal government and other bodies,” he said.\n\nOn Saturday, the federal government confirmed the ACMA would conduct an investigation.\n\nSA police, which had also worked through Friday night conducting welfare checks on 150 people whose triple zero calls failed, confirmed an eight-week-old boy from Gawler, on Adelaide’s northern fringe, and a 68-year-old woman from Queenstown, a suburb in the city’s north-west, had died during the outage.\n\nThe third death linked to the outage, which involved up to 600 attempted triple zero calls, was a 74-year-old Western Australian man, the state government confirmed on Saturday.\n\n“It is shocking and it is completely unacceptable that people’s lives have been put at risk, and of course, with deep sadness, I can confirm that one 74-year-old man has passed away,” Labor minister John Carey said at a press conference.\n\n“WA police are now making safety checks on the calls that did not get through, and they’re working through that.”\n\nMalinauskas said he was not informed about the outage until Optus had commenced a press conference announcing it to the public. He told reporters he had never witnessed “such incompetence” from an Australian communications company.\n\nThe premier said that only after its press conference on Friday did Optus give SA police the details, including the names of the deceased.\n\n“They’ve got to make sure they’re letting our emergency services know … all the information the moment they have it, before they think about crafting a media statement,” Malinauskas said.\n\n“It is somewhat extraordinary we had a situation (on Friday) after everything that had unfolded, that we were still struggling to get information from Optus to allow police to do their work.”\n\nCarey echoed the premier’s words on Saturday. “It is unbelievable, and the way that Optus has even just released the news, I think, is appalling.”\n\nRue said on Saturday afternoon that he had asked his team to make a plan for establishing a formal notification process between the telco and authorities during such incidents.\n\n“I’m sorry that the lack of this process led to the late notification of the premiers and chief ministers,” he said, confirming they were contacted at the same time as Friday’s press conference was held.\n\n“Optus will be appointing an independent person to lead a review into this entire incident, from every aspect. I hope to confirm that person in coming days.\n\n“The loss of the lives of three people, two in South Australia and one in Western Australia, is absolutely tragic. I would again like to extend my deepest condolences to their families and friends.”\n\nThe SA police commissioner, Grant Stevens, told the premier on Friday night that Optus had only supplied the suburbs where the deaths had occurred.\n\n“I then called the CEO of Optus and thankfully, it was rectified following that,” he said.\n\n“But the lack of information flow from Optus to the South Australian government’s appropriate authorities is somewhat bewildering, and it raises a lot of questions.”\n\nThe federal communications minister, Anika Wells, said the incident was “incredibly serious and completely unacceptable”.\n\n“The impact of this failure has had tragic consequences, and my personal thoughts are with those who have lost a loved one,” she said in a statement.\n\nIn a press conference on Saturday, Wells said Australians had “every right to be livid that Optus cannot get these basics right”.\n\n“Optus have let Australians down when they needed them most.”\n\nAll telecommunications providers were obliged to ensure they carried emergency service calls, and the outage would be thoroughly investigated, Wells said, adding that the government would wait until state authorities and communications regulatory bodies had completed their investigations before considering possible consequences for Optus.\n\nThe federal opposition’s communications spokesperson, Melissa McIntosh, expressed deep concern the triple zero camp-on arrangements to divert calls to other carriers like Telstra or Vodafone had also failed.\n\nThe outage occurred almost two years after more than 10 million Optus customers and businesses were disconnected for more than 16 hours in November 2023.\n\nPeople could not call triple zero on landlines, although it was still possible on a mobile.\n\nThe telco was fined more than $12m for breaching emergency call rules during the nationwide outage.\n\nRue took over as the company’s chief executive in 2024 from Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, who resigned over the 2023 outage."

While Jordanian authorities argue the Bdoul are living there illegally and risk damaging the archaeological site, human rights advocates have called for the halt of these evictions, emphasizing the cultural significance of the community. Many Bdoul residents, like Mohammed Feras, refuse relocation offers, asserting their deep connection to their homeland and expressing concerns for their livelihood and cultural heritage.",
        "source": "Guardian",
        "text": "By noon, the sun is high over Petra, bleaching the coloured sandstone cliffs and temporarily emptying its celebrated ruins of tourists. Vines and a canopy keep the terrace of Mohammed Feras’s cave home cool despite the searing summer heat rising from the rocky valley.\n\n“I have lived here all my life. I’ve never been anywhere else and I cannot imagine not living here. This area is part of who I am and I cannot leave it,” the 44-year-old farmer and sometime tourist guide said.\n\nWithin months, Feras and dozens of other Bedouin from the Bdoul community are likely to have left the caves they call home. There is little place for them in Petra as it is transformed by a major development programme that aims to build new facilities, regulate an anarchic tourist trade and provide a better experience for the hundreds of thousands of visitors drawn to the ancient site.\n\nFeras’s home, which he shares with his wife and nine children, comprises four connected 2,400-year-old caves and an adjoining tent. Just a 10-minute walk away are the remains of Petra’s grand temple and its colonnaded main street. It is also just a short hike from the monument known as the Treasury, made more famous by the 1989 blockbuster Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\n\nThe caves occupied by the Bdoul were originally an integral part of a wealthy trading city – the thriving capital of the Nabateans for 500 years before it was annexed by the Romans in around AD100 and eventually abandoned three centuries later.\n\nInternational human rights campaigners have called on Jordanian authorities to halt looming evictions. “Jordan’s displacement of the Bdoul from their historic homes in Petra puts their culture at risk,” said Adam Coogle, a Middle East and north Africa deputy director at Human Rights Watch. “The Jordanian government should halt the relocations and respect the rights of Petra’s Bedouin community.”\n\nOfficials charged with the management and development of Petra say the Bdoul who still live on the site are there illegally. They contend that many have alternative accommodation and that their use of the caves as homes, animal shelters, shops and storerooms risks causing irreparable harm.\n\n“If we want to preserve the integrity of the site for future generations then we have to stop the use of the caves for damaging activities,” said Dr Fares Braizat, the chief commissioner of the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority. “Everyone in the site, whoever they are, has to abide by the law, and it is illegal for anyone to live in or use the archaeological monuments within the [site of Petra] for whatever purposes.”\n\nHistorians say the Bdoul have lived in Petra’s caves for about 200 years. Efforts to remove the community from the site began shortly after its classification by the United Nations as a world heritage site in 1985. Then, in a deal negotiated with community leaders, thousands of people were moved to a purpose-built village nearby. Some evaded the relocation or have since moved back to their cave homes.\n\nIn recent years, with tourism a major contributor to Jordan’s flagging economy, big investments have been made at Petra. There is a new museum, cultural village and network of walking trails. Hundreds of stalls that choked the site have been cleared away, as have guides who harassed visitors. An effort has been made to cut down on overnight stays in caves being offered to tourists on social media or popular booking sites.\n\nThe new campaign to clear the caves began in late 2024 and targeted a dozen or so extended families now living around the Sutuh al-Nabi Harun mountain. The Jordanian authorities have been accused by campaigners of using “coercive tactics”.\n\nFeras, who earns a thin living from farming goats and sheep and occasionally acting as an guide, has rejected an offer from authorities of a house in the village where other Bdoul from Petra are now living. He said he was sent to prison earlier this year for failing to pay a heavy fine for destroying a heritage site. He was released after two weeks but now faces a new court hearing.\n\n“It’s ridiculous to accuse us of damaging the caves,” Feras said. “We are their guardians. We are not destroying anything. We just live the way we have lived for hundreds of years.”\n\nYasin Ahmed , one of Feras’s neighbours, said he had also received a court summons, as well as fines totalling tens of thousands of dollars, which he too could not pay.\n\n“I just don’t have that kind of money. I am not wealthy,” he said. “I grew up here and I don’t know anything else. I can’t survive in a house in a village … They are offering only a very small house but I have 10 children.”\n\nThe tourist trade in Jordan has been badly hit by the war in Gaza, with the number of visitors to Petra falling dramatically. The Bdoul who made a living from guiding tourists or selling souvenirs or soft drinks have lost much of their income.\n\nRayya Hussein, 85, has sworn never to leave her cave home, where she has lived all her life. Her parents are buried in the mountains close by. “If they want to force me to move out, I will go up on the mountain and jump,” she said.\n\nDr Olivia Mason, a political geographer at Newcastle University who has researched Petra and its development, said authorities saw the Bdoul as a nuisance, despite the UN making clear that their cultural heritage was an integral part of the site’s significance.\n\n“At the moment it’s the Jordanian authorities against the Bdoul, and no one acknowledges that they can work together,” Mason said. “There has to be some level of development, but that shouldn’t come at the expense of the local community.”\n\nBraizat said authorities had already promised some very elderly inhabitants that they could stay in their caves if they wanted to, and that the government-built houses offered to the Bdoul were adequately sized, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.\n\nHe admitted there was limited funding available for new housing in or near the existing and overcrowded village established for the community, but said there was a project to offer the Bdoul alternative livelihoods.\n\n“We are shouldering our responsibilities to give these people a better life, with access to schools, roads, hospitals and everything that they need,” Braizat said.\n\nBut to many of the Bdoul such words mean little. “We have lived here all our lives. Our freedom is being outside,” Feras said. “Here the children have freedom to go out with the sheep and run over the mountain. This is our soil.”\n\nSome names have been changed to protect identities"

She said she would “continue to challenge any last-minute, vexatious attempts to frustrate a removal in the courts”.\n\nThe returns agreement had faced growing scrutiny after reports of flights for removals being cancelled earlier this week.\n\nAnother Eritrean man successfully asked the high court on Tuesday to temporarily block his deportation after the judge found there was a “serious issue to be tried” over whether his removal was lawful amid claims he had been trafficked.\n\nBut on Thursday, in the second legal challenge brought against the Home Office over the deal, the same judge refused the migrant’s application for interim relief before a full legal challenge against the decision to deport him.\n\nBarristers for the man, who cannot be named, had argued that the decision was “procedurally unfair” as he had not been given sufficient opportunity to put forward evidence supporting his claim that he was an “alleged trafficking victim”.\n\nIn a ruling, Mr Justice Sheldon said “there is no serious issue to be tried in this case” and that the man gave differing accounts of his allegations of trafficking.\n\nMinisters agreed the pilot scheme with the French government in July as part of efforts to deter the record number of arrivals by small boat.\n\nHours after the first removal under the agreement, Trump urged the prime minister to involve the military.\n\nAt a joint Chequers press conference with the prime minister, the president highlighted his own record in securing the US borders and suggested the UK faced a similar challenge.\n\nHe said: “You have people coming in and I told the prime minister I would stop it, and it doesn’t matter if you call out the military, it doesn’t matter what means you use.\n\n“It destroys countries from within and we’re actually now removing a lot of the people that came into our country.”"

        "article_summary": "BHP, Australia's largest miner, has escalated its campaign against Queensland's revamped royalty scheme, blaming it for suspending operations at its Saraji South coalmine and cutting 750 jobs. The company argues that \"unsustainable\" royalties and market conditions are impacting profitability, despite analysts noting that rising production costs and labor expenses are more significant factors. This move highlights BHP's willingness to engage in political battles over resource wealth distribution, as it seeks to influence state policies amid a declining coal market.",
        "source": "Guardian",
        "text": "Australia’s big miners are not averse to a political fight.\n\nConsider the biggest miner of them all: BHP.\n\nIn 2010, it fought fiercely against the super profits tax and helped bring down a prime minister. In 2017, a state party leader who championed an increase in mine lease fees in Western Australia lost his seat after a campaign by BHP.\n\nAnd since 2022, the big miner has railed against Queensland’s revamped royalty scheme, brought in by Labor and now supported by the Liberal National government.\n\nOn Wednesday, BHP escalated its campaign by blaming “unsustainable” royalties and market conditions for its decision with its joint venture partner, Mitsubishi, to suspend operations at its Saraji South coalmine in the Bowen Basin, and slash 750 roles across the state.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nThe big miner said it will also conduct a strategic review of the BHP FutureFit Academy in Mackay – an educational facility that trains new miners – because of the royalty scheme’s “unsustainable impact on our business returns”.\n\nShortly after the announcement, two other miners operating in Queensland, Anglo American and QCoal, revealed job cuts.\n\nRoyalties alone don’t explain the decisions.\n\nDig deeper\n\nThe BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) operates five coking coalmines in Queensland’s Bowen Basin, most of which are open-cut operations. Coking coal, also known as metallurgical or met coal, differs from thermal coal used in heating – a business that BHP has been exiting.\n\nThere’s some pretty obvious reasons coalmines across Queensland aren’t as profitable as they used to be, most of which have nothing to do with the state’s tiered royalty rates.\n\nProduction costs have been rising as miners dig deeper into the earth. This takes more fuel, and causes expensive wear and tear on equipment, to get at it.\n\nAt the same time, worker wages and associated labour costs have risen in a sector that regularly experiences skills shortages.\n\n“They’ve got a cost problem – and royalties are one of those elements – but they’re certainly not the main element,” says Andrew Gorringe, energy financial analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\n“They’ve also been focused on getting volume at any cost. When the prices were good and they wanted to sell as much coal as they could, they expanded with little thought to costs.”\n\nCoalminers recently emerged from a windfall period, marked by huge price rises after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Coking coal prices soared above $US600 a tonne in 2022, but have since normalised at under $US200.\n\nIn 2022, as prices were soaring, the then Labor government introduced three new royalty tiers to capture a greater share of wealth generated during commodity price spikes. The base rates, when prices are lower, remain the same.\n\nThe scheme agitates miners because it reduces, but in no way eliminates, the excesses they can earn during boom times, setting up an ideological clash between the resources sector and those who believe mineral wealth should be apportioned more evenly.\n\nGorringe says unit cash costs, which are a key profitability metric, for Queensland’s coking coal producers have risen 50% since 2018.\n\nRoyalties actually represent a lower percentage of their cost base in 2025 than they did before the pandemic, according to his analysis.\n\nCoal ‘tax’\n\nThe ideological divide is evident in BHP’s description of royalties as the Queensland government’s “coal tax”, a politically charged term designed to stir up support for the resources sector in the community.\n\nIn Australia, state governments own the minerals in the ground. Miners pay a royalty to access them; they are not a tax.\n\nIt would be the ultimate mark of a successful lobbying campaign if the resources sector convinces the general public miners should pay a lower rate for a publicly owned resource.\n\nThe idea that the state purse might receive a higher rate when prices surge is particularly sensitive for coalminers because they are in a sector that may not have many booms left.\n\n“Structural decline in one of Australia’s largest fossil fuel export commodities coupled with rising unit costs are the factors driving these investment and operating decisions, not Queensland’s nation-leading royalty scheme,” says Matt Pollard, an analyst at clean energy consultancy Climate Energy Finance.\n\nWhile the role of coking coal in steelmaking will eventually be supplanted by cleaner alternatives, BHP argues that it is “considered indispensable for the foreseeable future”.\n\nAfter commodity price booms subside, miners typically shed some jobs and re-focus on bringing down production costs, which is evident in the series of recent announcements from coalminers of workforce changes.\n\nSome projects may simply not be viable outside boom times.\n\nTo be sure, Queensland’s royalty regime is a cost that miners must factor in to their anticipated workforce needs, but it is not the primary trigger for job cuts in a sector that appears to be in decline.\n\nBHP’s decision to link the royalty scheme to its “strategic review” of its Mackay training facility has a particular sting to it, given it looks like an ultimatum to bring the state government to the negotiating table.\n\nBHP has, once again, shown it’s not averse to a political fight."

        "text": "Four people – including three teenagers – are accused of a hate crime in Washington state after being arrested in connection with an alleged attack on a transgender woman that left the victim hospitalized, according to authorities.\n\nThe Renton police department said the four suspects in the case first argued with the 39-year-old woman on Monday evening – then beat her after she saw them again later. Investigators say they hurled homophobic slurs at the victim, who was attacked on a street near a transit center in Renton and suffered serious injuries.\n\n“They chased her, knocked her to the ground, and repeatedly assaulted her,” police said in their statement.\n\nPolice documents obtained by ABC elaborate, recounting how the woman told officers she first encountered the group while telling them to stop “harassing” people at a local transit center. That drew the group’s attention, and they began “charging towards her”, the police documents alleged.\n\nShe told police she fell and heard someone yell a transphobic slur. As she tried to get up and leave, members of the group began assaulting her, and one of the alleged attackers choked her. The victim reportedly said she believed she was going to die.\n\nABC reported that video of the reported attack – recorded by a witness – showed the group “violently punch and kick the victim” in her head and upper body, including while she was on the ground, according to what police wrote in documents. The group walked away while the woman was on the ground, police said.\n\nPolice arrested two of the suspects – boys ages 15 and 17 who were siblings – near the scene of the alleged attack soon after it happened.\n\nA third boy, 16, was arrested Thursday on suspicion of assault and a hate crime. Police put out a plea on social media to help identify the fourth suspect, posting surveillance pictures of him, taking note of his distinctive facial hair, necklace and jacket. Court filings cited by ABC said officers identified him through his high school campus security team.\n\nA family member on the local Crime Stoppers chapter’s website recognized the man in the photo and urged him to surrender. Police said that man then turned himself over to police to be booked on counts of assault and a hate crime.\n\nPolice did not identify the three teen suspects because of their ages. They identified the fourth as 25-year-old Ramodre Edwards.\n\nKing county prosecutors charged the two sibling suspects with assault, strangulation, great bodily harm and a hate crime. Both pleaded not guilty and were ordered to remain on electronic home monitoring, prosecutors reportedly said.\n\nThe third teen suspect was put on electronic home detention pending a charging decision from prosecutors, which was expected on 23 September, as ABC first reported, citing prosecutors. A charging decision for Edwards – whose bail was set at $300,000 – is also expected 23 September."

McIvor was recognized for his eclectic musical taste and contributions to global dance culture, leaving behind a legacy of creativity and collaboration.",

        "text": "JD Twitch, the Scottish DJ and producer celebrated as one half of the duo Optimo, has died aged 57.\n\nThe artist, whose real name was Keith McIvor, had been diagnosed with an untreatable brain tumour, which he announced in July. He died on Friday in Glasgow’s Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice, his DJ partner Jonnie Wilkes (AKA JG Wilkes) announced.\n\n“In a 28 year partnership he changed my life immeasurably and together we took our work in directions and to places few people are lucky enough to explore,” Wilkes said. “I am forever grateful for everything he bestowed on me, both as a partner in music and as a friend.”\n\nMcIvor grew up in Edinburgh in a family who “had the most middle of the road, blandest music taste imaginable”, he later said, but after moving to Glasgow to go to university in 1986 he became involved in club culture across both cities.\n\nHe began DJing electro and EBM (electronic body music) at a club night in Edinburgh, graduating to house and techno as those styles reached the UK and the acid house era began. The night was shut down by police after a brawl between football hooligans, but McIvor began a new night called Pure with the blessing of the authorities by making it a members only event. “It gave us the chance to start again from scratch and do a club 100% on our own terms,” he said. “Out went anything to do with all the awful Madchester-related music and in came a completely different crowd.”\n\nPure became a core event in the Scottish house and techno scene, but McIvor – who grew to find DJ culture “all pretty boring” – began another event in 1997 that gave voice to the breadth of his catholic taste. Taking its name from the track Optimo by New York punk-funk band Liquid Liquid – which McIvor would go on to remix – the Sunday night event at Glasgow’s Sub Club alongside DJ partner JG Wilkes (Jonnie Wilkes) ran every week until 2010.\n\nMcIvor said the pair were not “aligned to any one particular musical movement” – championing electroclash, punk, new wave, soft rock and a range of other styles alongside dance tracks, and hosting bands such as LCD Soundsystem and TV On the Radio as well as guest DJs. Optimo pre-empted the open-mindedness of the internet age, and became lauded as one of the most significant events in global dance culture. Thereafter McIvor and Wilkes continued to DJ internationally under the Optimo name.\n\nMcIvor was also a producer, and as Optimo’s star rose he was sought after as a remixer for the likes of Franz Ferdinand, Róisín Murphy, Manic Street Preachers, Florence + the Machine and more (“Discogs tells me I did 108 remixes, though it’s probably a few more,” he said in 2023). McIvor also founded the label Optimo Music (plus spin-offs such as the Brazil-focused Selva Discos), and Optimo created acclaimed compilation albums such as How to Kill the DJ (Part Two). McIvor also curated the soundtrack to Beats, a 2019 film set in the 90s rave scene in Scotland, and put out music under the alias Tomorrow the Rain Will Fall Upwards.\n\nMcIvor announced his illness in July 2025, saying: “My symptoms weren’t immediately diagnosed, and my health declined very rapidly over just a few weeks … I am currently trying to process this news and prioritising spending precious time with the people I love.”\n\nWilkes added in his tribute to McIvor: “I am forever grateful for everything he bestowed on me, both as a partner in music and as a friend. Keith’s intensity and passion for life, for music, for creativity and for positive change simply never let up. He was formidable. His belief in people and the idea that standing together, that our collective strength is powerful was unwavering. I loved him for that.”\n\nAfter thanking hospice staff and others, he added: “Keith left us far too soon. He will go now to travel those space-ways but I know his energy remains in every one of us who had the privilege of knowing him. I love you forever Keith."

        "article_summary": "As Trump prepares to nominate a replacement for outgoing GAO head Gene Dodaro, concerns are rising among lawmakers about the implications of a president with expansive spending authority selecting Congress' chief watchdog. The new GAO director will play a crucial role in either reinforcing or undermining Congress' oversight capabilities, especially as Trump faces legal challenges over his funding decisions. With the nomination process yet to begin and uncertainty surrounding the candidates, former GAO director David Walker emphasizes the need for a leader who can independently challenge the executive branch, regardless of political affiliation.",
        "source": "Politico - Congress",
        "text": "Now Trump gets to nominate Dodaro’s replacement, and key lawmakers are only just starting to take stock of a paradox: A president who continually tests the bounds of Congress’ spending powers gets to pick the legislative branch’s chief watchdog.\n\n“It sets up a very bad situation,” Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, the next Senate Democratic whip and a senior appropriator, said in an interview. “Among the things to be alarmed about, this is a new one.”\n\nThe stakes are high: Whoever ends up running GAO once Dodaro’s term ends will be able to bolster, or undermine, Congress’ defenses against Trump in the separation-of-powers battle the president is stoking by terminating, freezing and reallocating hundreds of billions of dollars Congress previously approved.\n\n“When one party controls the Senate, the House and the White House, there’s a tendency to rally around the president and to do what the president wants,” said David Walker, Dodaro’s predecessor and the only living former GAO director. “But somebody’s got to be able to be the independent referee, and to try to do what they think is in the interest of the institution, the Congress and the country. And that’s what the comptroller general is.”\n\nAll of this is taking place as Trump administration officials and some congressional Republicans have been trying to downsize and discredit the watchdog. That has included publicly questioning the GAO’s authority and accusing the agency of siding with Democrats in its multiple determinations that the White House unlawfully flouted Congress’ “power of the purse.”\n\nWhite House budget director Russ Vought said this month that GAO is “a quasi-legislative independent entity … something that shouldn’t exist.”\n\nThere have been other slights, too. In the Senate, the GAO told Republicans they could not skirt the filibuster in voting to override California’s pollution standards; Republicans did so anyway. In the House, GOP lawmakers endorsed cutting the agency’s roughly $800 million budget in half for the upcoming fiscal year. And Elon Musk, prior to leaving the Trump administration, attempted to send in a Department of Government Efficiency team to assess the GAO for mass staff reductions.\n\nMeanwhile, the legislative branch writ large has become more broadly vulnerable to the White House’s whims, seen most starkly in Trump’s abrupt firing of the librarian of Congress and the registrar of copyrights.\n\nIt’s not yet clear what the Dodaro succession plan will look like; a White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA 10-member panel of lawmakers is supposed to recommend at least three replacement candidates for Trump to consider. By law, that group is composed of the top leaders in each chamber, the chairs and ranking members of the key House and Senate oversight committees and the Senate president pro tempore.\n\nHowever, most congressional leaders have yet to start hunting for qualified contenders, and furthermore seem largely unaware they have any role to play in filling the slot.\n\n“I don’t even know the process,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in a brief interview. “It’s been a while. This hasn’t happened on my watch.”\n\nTwo of the would-be commission members had kind words for Dodaro, including Sen. Rand Paul, chair of the Senate Homeland and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\n“I’ve always appreciated him, and I think he’s a straight shooter,” the Kentucky Republican said in an interview.\n\nSen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), the panel’s ranking member, said he “would want somebody like Gene, who has been a really solid member.”\n\nOn the House side, Oversight Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) said in an interview he’s looking for the next GAO director to be “an aggressive person that looks for waste, fraud and abuse.”\n\nComer added, “We want someone that communicates regularly with Congress, so we can kind of have an idea of what they’re doing.”\n\nBut Trump could instead ask Republican senators to confirm a new watchdog of his own choosing — or forgo making a nomination altogether.\n\nIt would leave a leadership vacuum at the top of the agency that not only monitors whether Congress’ spending directives are followed but is also empowered to examine the effectiveness of federal agencies on behalf of lawmakers.\n\nFurther raising the stakes in confirming a new director, lawsuits are pending around the country challenging Trump’s withholding of congressionally approved funding, and a federal appeals court ruled this summer that only the GAO director can sue the administration for violating the decades-old impoundment law — not the groups that were set to receive the funding.\n\nDodaro has so far chosen not to sue the Trump administration for withholding funding. But when he steps down, he’ll be able to pick an acting GAO director who also would have the power to file a lawsuit if they so choose.\n\nStill, said Molly Reynolds, head of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, “if you get a comptroller general in place who is Trump-friendly, that is going to foreclose that option” of GAO suing the administration.\n\nAn acting director also wouldn’t be “in a position to make major transformational changes,” warned Walker, the former GAO director.\n\nWhen Walker resigned in 2008, he appointed Dodaro acting director, a title that stuck for more than two years because Congress and the president weren’t quick to work through the nomination process. Before that, it also took two years to formally install Walker in the post in 1998.\n\nWalker is now urging congressional leaders to recommend candidates who are willing to challenge executive branch officials regardless of who is president, as he did during his own tenure. A political independent who “leans Republican” and was confirmed by a GOP-led Senate, Walker sued the Republican vice president, Dick Cheney, for failure to provide GAO access to records.\n\nHe is also agitating for lawmakers to quickly start the search for potential replacements: “There’s no reason that they shouldn’t be planning now so that they can end up trying to make a timely decision.”"

This move, initiated by Pentagon head Pete Hegseth, limits reporters' movements within the building and has drawn criticism from journalists and press advocates who argue it undermines independent reporting and violates First Amendment rights. Critics emphasize that such restrictions could lead to government-controlled narratives about military actions, raising concerns about transparency and accountability.",
        "source": "Guardian",
        "text": "The US military has issued new media restrictions demanding that journalists pledge not to gather any information – including unclassified documents – that has not been authorized for release or else risk revocation of their press passes.\n\nIn a memo issued Thursday, the Pentagon stated that “it remains committed to transparency to promote accountability and public trust”. However, using an abbreviation for the recently rebranded Department of War headed by the Trump administration’s Pete Hegseth, the memo added: “DoW information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified.”\n\nIt went on to say: “Only authorized persons who have received favorable determinations of eligibility for access, signed approved non-disclosure agreements, and have a need-to-know may be granted access to [classified national security information].”\n\nJournalists reporting from the Pentagon are now required to sign a pledge agreeing to restrict their movements within the building and not to access any unauthorized materials. If they refuse to sign the pledge, their Pentagon press passes will be revoked.\n\nIn a post on X, Hegseth said Friday: “The ‘press’ does not run the Pentagon – the people do. The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility. Wear a badge and follow the rules – or go home.”\n\nThe latest memo follows the announcement by Hegseth in May regarding new press restrictions at the Pentagon. These restrictions limit reporters’ movements within the building to specific areas including the press pens, food court and courtyard. This is a departure from the usual practice under previous presidential administrations where reporters typically had more freedom of movement within the Pentagon.\n\nHegseth has severely limited media access after facing backlash for sharing sensitive information about US strikes in Yemen in March in a Signal group chat where a journalist was accidentally included.\n\nSince he assumed office, Hegseth has maintained a hostile attitude towards major media networks. He ordered the removal of various longstanding news organizations including the New York Times, CNN, Politico and NPR from their dedicated offices in the Pentagon.\n\nThe Pentagon’s latest memo has drawn criticism from journalists and free press advocates, with the National Press Club’s president Mike Balsamo saying: “This is a direct assault on independent journalism at the very place where independent scrutiny matters most: the US military.\n\n“If the news about our military must first be approved by the government, then the public is no longer getting independent reporting. It is getting only what officials want them to see. That should alarm every American.”\n\nSimilarly, Freedom of the Press Foundation said “this policy operates as a prior restraint on publication, which is considered the most serious” violations of the press freedoms guaranteed by the US constitution’s first amendment.\n\n“The government cannot prohibit journalists from public information merely by claiming it’s a secret,” the foundation said.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas Evans, editor in chief of National Public Radio (NPR), said his outlet was “taking this very seriously”.\n\n“We’ll be working with other news organizations to push back,” Evans remarked. “We’re big fans of the first amendment and transparency, and we want the American public to understand what’s being done in their name.”\n\nThe Pentagon’s restrictions on media access come as Trump suggested recently that TV networks should be punished for “negative coverage”. That statement followed widespread backlash over ABC’s indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s popular late-night show, on which the veteran comedian said that many in Trump’s Make America Great Again movement “are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk”, referring to the 10 September killing of the rightwing activist.\n\nSpeaking on Air Force One on Thursday, Trump said – without providing evidence – that “97% [of major US networks are] against me”.\n\n“They give me only bad press,” he said, adding that he believed broadcasters should have their licenses “taken away” as a result.\n\nAmong those to endorse Trump’s argument was the US senator Cynthia Lummis. The Wyoming Republican recently told the US news website Semafor that such licenses are “a privilege” rather than a “right” – and she said to the outlet that she no longer believes the first amendment is “the ultimate right”.\n\n“I feel like something’s changed culturally,” Lummis said, in part. “And I think there needs to be cognizance that things have changed.”"

All members of the press issued a Pentagon Facility Alternate Credential (PFAC), will be required to read and sign a new in-brief form outlining information security requirements, the new physical control measures, and Department of War expectations of their compliance with safety and security requirements. The package that will be provided to the member of the press as part of the in-brief includes the following: 0 Pentagon Reservation In-brief for Media Members Appendix A, \"Denial, Revocation, or Non-Renewal of Pentagon Facility Alternative Credentials\" Appendix B, \"Additional Press Identifier Badge\" Appendix C, SW memo, \"Updated Physical Control Measures for Press/Media Access Within the Pentagon\" Appendix D, graphic showing the areas on the first and second floor of the Pentagon where press do not require a new escort Appendix E, graphic showing the route that press can take to access the River Entrance on weekends and holidays In addition to the Additional Press Identifier Badge depicted in Appendix B, the Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA), will begin issuing new PFACs to the press in coming weeks. Priority of issuance of the new PFACS will be to resident members of the media through September 30, 2025. Non-resident members of the media and crew badging begins effective October 1, 2025. These new PFACs will have \"PRESS\" clearly imprinted on them in red letters both vertically and horizontally to assist in identifying members of the press. Request your assistance in ensuring that all your personnel are aware of the physical control measures, including the requirement to provide escorts for any media coming into your spaces for approved interviews. Additionally, personnel should be aware that if they see any news media outside of the areas depicted in Appendix D that do not have an escort, they should direct them back to the designated no-escort required areas and alert the Pentagon Press Operations office at 703-697-5131.\n\nPENTAGON RESERVATION IN-BRIEF FOR MEDIA MEMBERS NAME: DATE: The purpose of this briefing is to inform you, as a member of the news media who has been granted access to the Pentagon Reservation and issued a Pentagon Facilities Alternative Credential (PFAC), also known as a Department of War Building Pass or a Pentagon badge, of the rules regarding conduct on the Pentagon Reservation. Failure to abide by these rules may result in suspension or revocation of your building pass and loss of access. Additionally, this briefing informs you of the procedures associated with denying, revoking, or not renewing the issuance of a PFAC, including contesting such a decision (see Appendix A). General Security Be alert for suspicious activity and immediately report any unusual activity and/or circumstances to the Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA) at (703) 697-1001. Ensure office doors are locked and property is secure when exiting your office or cubicle. Every individual entering the building is subject to random metal detector and X-ray inspection of personal belongings. Many events, including those involving the Secretary of War, Deputy Secretary of War, or visiting high-level U.S. government officials or foreign dignitaries, require additional security screenings to which PFAC holders would be subject. Every individual exiting the building is subject to random checks of personal belongings. A property pass is required to remove property from the building that is not readily identifiable as personal. When you or other members of your organization (e.g., technicians, photographers) remove equipment owned by your organization, obtain a property pass in advance to avoid problems when exiting the building. Property passes may be obtained in the Pentagon Press Operations (PPO) office, room 2D961, during normal working hours. PFAC Security Maintaining the security of your PFAC is an individual responsibility. PFACS must be visible and always worn above the waist while in the Pentagon, except as noted below during press or other recorded events. Remove or hide your PFAC from view when not in the Pentagon. Exceptions for press and other events: Do not have your PFAC visible in the following circumstances: when present during an on-camera press briefing; when doing a live-shot in the Pentagon Briefing Room or stand-ups at the Mall Entrance, River Parade Field, or\n\non the Connector Parking Lot hill; when covering honor cordon arrival ceremonies; if on- camera during an open press event on the Pentagon Reservation; or at any other events that will be recorded via photograph or video. For those with a recording studio in the Pentagon, do not have your PFAC visible when recording in your studio. Lost PFACS should be immediately reported to PPO at (703) 697-5131, or, after normal working hours, to (703) 678-6162 or to OSD.PA.DutyOfficer@mail.mil. Normal working hours for PPO on non-holiday weekdays are 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time. Additional Press Identifier Badge The Additional Press Identifier Badge (APIB) (see Appendix B) must also be visible and always worn above the waist while in the Pentagon. Note that APIBS serve only as an additional visual identifier. APIBS are not credentials and do not confer credentialing or attendance approval for any event. News Media Physical Security Restrictions on the Pentagon Reservation Effective May 23, 2025, in accordance with Secretary of War Memorandum, \"Updated Physical Control Measures for Press/Media Access within the Pentagon,\" May 23, 2025 (Appendix C), new physical security restrictions have been enacted for news media, including those with valid, current PFACS: News media are not authorized to be anywhere on the 5th Floor, 4th Floor, 3rd Floor, Basement, or Mezzanine levels, including all corridors and rings, at any time without an escort from an authorized DoW official. On the 2nd Floor, news media are authorized unescorted access in the Pentagon for the below areas. For all other areas of the 2nd Floor not included below, except as otherwise addressed in this in-brief, news media must have an escort from authorized DoW personnel: o Rings A through E between Corridors 1, 10 and 9 (from the Metro Entrance on the E Ring through the Concourse to the A Ring); ○ E Ring from the Metro Entrance to Corridor 9; O E Ring from the River Entrance directly to Corridor 9; 0 O ○ Corridor 9 from the E Ring to the A Ring; 951-999 At the Apex of Corridors 9/10, the exit to the Courtyard; A Ring from the Apex of Corridors 9/10 to the Mall Corridor between Corridor 6 and 7 and the Mall Corridor to the Mall Entrance for the purpose getting to and from the Mall Entrance for stand-ups On the 1st Floor, news media are authorized unescorted access to the Center Courtyard and the Food Court between Corridors 1 and 10. See Appendix D for a graphic of the areas where the news media are authorized unescorted access. News media are not authorized access to the Pentagon Athletic Center. 2\n\nIf news media require access to other areas or offices within the Pentagon for in-person interviews or other engagements, they must be escorted to and from those spaces by authorized DoW personnel. Public Release of DoW Information and the Protection of Classified National Security Information and Controlled Unclassified Information DoW remains committed to transparency to promote accountability and public trust. However, DoW information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified. The Department of War must safeguard classified national security information (CNSI), in accordance with Executive Order 13526 and the Atomic Energy Act, and information designated as controlled unclassified information (CUI), in accordance with Executive Order 13556. Only authorized persons who have received favorable determinations of eligibility for access, signed approved non-disclosure agreements, and have a need-to-know may be granted access to CNSI. DoW may only provide CUI to individuals when there is a lawful governmental purpose for doing so. Unauthorized disclosure of CNSI or CUI poses a security risk that could damage the national security of the United States and place DoW personnel in jeopardy. Escort Privileges and Procedures A PFAC authorizes media members who are U.S. citizens to access the Pentagon 24 hours a day and affords escort privileges for up to three visiting media members from the same media outlet who possess appropriate media credentials. Visiting media members must be entered into the PFPA Visitor Management System (VMS) by the sponsoring U.S. public affairs office no later than one business day in advance for U.S. citizens and no later than three business days in advance for non-U.S. citizens. A PFAC also affords escort privileges for media members who are U.S. citizens for up to three visiting family members for special events, such as the Bring Your Child to Work Day, subject to the approval of the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of War for Public Affairs (OATSW(PA)). Family members 18 years and older must be entered into the PFPA Visitor Management System (VMS) by the sponsoring public affairs office no later than 24 hours in advance for U.S. citizens and no later than 48 hours in advance for non-U.S. citizens. PFAC holders escorting other media members or family members must stay with their visitor(s) at all times. Failure to do so may result in loss of the PFAC issued to you. PFAC holders who are not U.S. citizens do not have escort privileges. 3\n\nPFAC Issuance and Renewals PFACs may be issued to those media members who require regular access to the Pentagon, who are accessing the building at a minimum monthly visit frequency. See PPO for the current minimum monthly visit frequency. You must continue to meet the minimum access frequency requirement to be reissued a PFAC. There are two probationary periods for an initial PFAC issuance. An initial PFAC expires in three months, on the last day of the third month. You may submit a request for renewal at the beginning of the month of expiration. Media members who have met the minimum monthly visit frequency requirements during the initial three-month probationary period and who have not posed a security or safety risk to DoW personnel or property will generally be approved for a six-month badge. The second probationary period is for six months. Requests for renewals of a six-month PFAC may be submitted at the beginning of the month of expiration. Media members who have met the minimum monthly visit frequency requirements during the six-month probationary period and who have not posed a security or safety risk to DoW personnel or property during both the initial three-month and subsequent six-month probationary periods, will generally be approved for a one-year PFAC. If the two probationary periods have been completed successfully and all requirements have been met, PFACS will be renewed annually. During annual renewal reviews, if frequency requirements have not been met, PFAC renewals may be denied or revert to 3- or 6-month PFACS. For all renewals, PFACS expire on the last day of the month of expiration. Renewal requests should be submitted at the beginning of the month of expiration, but not before the start of the month of expiration. Requests received prior to the start of the month will not be processed until the first business day of the month. Due to processing times, renewal requests should be submitted to PPO no later than the middle of the month of expiration to ensure a new badge is available before the old one expires. Frequency requirements may be waived by OATSW(PA) for a news organization's equipment technicians and some camera crews, if specifically identified and requested by the bureau chief. For first-time applications, equipment technicians and camera crews must still go through the two probationary periods. PFACS may be denied, revoked, or not renewed if a person is reasonably determined to pose a security or safety risk to DoW personnel or property, or is not meeting the frequency requirements. An initial determination of a security or safety risk may result in an immediate suspension of Pentagon access during the process for making a final determination. A determination that an individual poses a security risk may be based on the unauthorized access, attempted unauthorized access, or unauthorized disclosure of CNSI or CUI. See Appendix A for information on the applicable standard and the process for denying, revoking, or non-renewing a PFAC. 4\n\nPress Parking Parking on the Pentagon Reservation is restricted to vehicles with permanent parking permits, or which have been cleared for temporary parking for specific days. Vehicles may only be parked in the areas for which they have been cleared. There is a designated parking area for the news media at the Pentagon. The parking spaces in two lanes of the Connector Lot, located at intersection of Connector Road and Boundary Channel Drive, have been reserved for the press (see Appendix E). These parking spaces are clearly marked with \"PRESS\" stenciled on the ground. To access the building, for those with a PFAC, walk north towards Boundary Drive and go up either the stairs or the ramp to the pedestrian bridge. At the security checkpoint, swipe your badge and then show it to the PFPA officer on duty. See the route depicted at Appendix E. The checkpoint opens at 6:00 a.m. and closes at 8:00 p.m. on weekdays. The checkpoint is closed on weekends and federal holidays. All visiting press must go through the Visitor Center at the Pentagon Metro Entrance. There are a limited number of permanent \"P\" parking permits for news media members. Those who have such permits may park in designated PRESS spaces with their approved \"P\" parking permit at any time. News media members with \"P\" permit are not authorized to park elsewhere on the Pentagon Reservation, except when provided specific guidance to do so for special circumstances (e.g., when the Connector Lot is being re-surfaced, or closed for a special event). For such instances, PPO will provide information on where you may park. News media members desiring to be issued a \"P\" parking pass should contact PPO; there is usually a waiting list for available permit. News media without a “P” parking permit may also park in the PRESS area provided they obtain an approved temporary parking clearance prior to their arrival at the Pentagon. News media should contact the PPO Admin Support Team at 703-697-5131 at least 30 minutes prior to their arrival to request temporary parking clearance, and must provide the PPO with the following information: date requesting to park if not the day of the call, driver's name, email, phone number, media outlet, vehicle make, vehicle model, vehicle color, license plate number, state of registration, vehicle classification (car/truck/motorcycle/etc.), fuel type (gas/diesel/hybrid/electric), and whether it is a personal vehicle or a business vehicle. For repeat visits using the same vehicle, press need only provide date, name, and vehicle license plate. For parking on weekends, call the PPO Duty Officer at 703-678-6162. News media may request temporary parking clearance for up to 5 days per month. Press can request an exception from the PPO for more days only on a case-by-case basis. 5\n\nOvernight parking at the Pentagon is not permitted for members of the news media. Overnight parking is considered parking for more than 24 hours at a time. Access on Weekends If news media need to access the Pentagon on weekends, holidays, or when the pedestrian bridge between the Connector Lot and River Entrance is closed, news media may park in the press parking area and walk along Connector Road to River Road, go through a pedestrian turnstile, and continue walking up the River Road to Mug Handle to get to the River Entrance, which is open 24/7. See Appendix E for a depiction of the route. Note that those without a \"P\" parking permit must still provide their vehicle information to the PPO Duty Officer at 703-678-6162. Mall Entrance Temporary Parking News media crews that are doing a stand-up at the Mall Entrance location may request Mall parking. Mall Entrance parking is by reservation only. News media should contact the PPO Support Team at 703-697-5131 at least two hours prior to their arrival to request Mall Entrance parking clearance and must provide the same information as for regular press parking (see above) with the addition of time and arrival. Note that due to demand, there may be times when parking in the Mall Entrance lot is restricted to four hours per day. Visiting press who need to be at the Pentagon all day should park either in regular press parking or at the Mall Entrance. Parking at the Mall Entrance is by numbered spaces; PPO will provide the numbered parking space for each vehicle when Mall Entrance Parking is requested. Filming/Photography Filming, photography, and audio recording on the Pentagon Reservation is prohibited, unless approved in advance. In accordance with 32 CFR § 234.15 - Use of visual recording devices: (a) The use of cameras or other visual recording devices on the Pentagon Reservation is prohibited, unless the use of such items are approved by the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, the Installation Commander, or the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of War for Public Affairs. (b) It shall be unlawful to make any photograph, sketch, picture, drawing, map or graphical representation of the Pentagon Reservation without first obtaining permission of the Pentagon Force Protection Agency or the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of War for Public Affairs. Note that this prohibition applies to the use of apps on mobile devices that utilize the front-facing camera lens, such as \"FaceTime\" or the taking of \"selfies.\" 6\n\nNews media visiting the National Pentagon 9/11 Memorial in their personal capacity, not as a member of the press, may take photos using their personal devices. Filming or photography in the Memorial for a news media interview or to obtain b-roll requires an exception, as described below under Filming/Photography Exception Requests. Filming/Photography Pre-Approved Exceptions News media do not need to obtain permission in advance for filming, photography, or audio recording in the following circumstances: O 0 Press events in the Pentagon Briefing Room. Press events announced by OATSW(PA), the public affairs office for the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or the public affairs offices of the Military Departments or Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps, that are not located in the Pentagon Briefing Room. Examples would include honor cordons and events at the Pentagon River Terrace Parade Field, the Pentagon Auditorium, and the Pentagon Center Courtyard. Unilateral news media stand-ups in the Pentagon Briefing Room, if approved, at the designated stand-up location outside the Mall Entrance, or live or recorded shots inside the network studio rooms in the Correspondent's Corridor. Recording audio of off-camera interviews approved and monitored by authorized DoW public affairs personnel. Filming/Photography Exception Requests The filming/photography exception requests discussed below require public affairs escort from either OATSW(PA) or the sponsoring public affairs office, regardless of whether the news media involved have a current PFAC or are visiting press. News media desiring to obtain b-roll or stock footage or photos of the Pentagon interior or exterior must submit a request to PPO a minimum of one week in advance to obtain permission. If this request is in conjunction with a press event sponsored by a public affairs office other than OATSW(PA), submit the request through the sponsoring public affairs office. Requests should include date and times and either the exact location or sufficient information for the public affairs office to determine the best available locations for the footage or photos. News media desiring to film DoW officials standing or walking in a corridor in conjunction with an interview must submit a request through the sponsoring public affairs office to PPO a minimum of one week in advance to obtain permission. Request must include date, time, and exact location. News media desiring to photograph DoW officials in their offices or conference rooms in conjunction with an interview must submit their request through the sponsoring public affairs office to the security manager for that space. 7\n\nNews media desiring to obtain b-roll or interview or film anyone inside the National Pentagon 9/11 Memorial must submit a DD Form 2798, \"Application/Permit for Use of Space on the Pentagon Reservation,” at least one week in advance to the Pentagon Facility Operations Division Special Events Office at whs.pentagon.fsd.mbx.pbmo- special-events@mail.mil. You can download a DD Form 2798 here: https://www.esd.whs.mil/Directives/forms/dd2500 2999/DD2798/ Filming/Photography from the Press Parking Area News media desiring to do a stand-up or film from the grassy hill next to the press parking area (see Appendix E) should submit a request to PPO no later than three hours in advance. Requests should include the date, time, and the number of personnel in the crew. Once approved, filming from the grassy hill does not require public affairs escort. Pandemics, National Health Emergencies, and Other Contingencies During a declared pandemic or national health emergency, the DoW will protect the workforce while continuing to perform its national security mission. Protecting the workforce may entail the adoption of personal protective measures, restrictions on access to the Pentagon for essential functions only, symptom screenings, or other measures. In the event of a declared pandemic or national health emergency, news media entering the Pentagon are expected to follow the same personal protective measures as Dow personnel and as required by Health Protection Condition (HPCON) announcements. Failure or refusal to comply may result in a loss of access, ranging from temporary suspension to revocation of PFACS. Additionally, news media are not considered essential personnel. During a declared pandemic or national health emergency, news media may temporarily be denied physical access to the Pentagon. During other general emergency contingencies (e.g., fires, active shooters, natural disasters, utility outages), news media physical access to the Pentagon may be temporarily curtailed or denied. 8\n\nNAME: Acknowledgements Please read and initial each of the below: DATE: I understand that PFACs are extended as a courtesy to media members who work full-time in the Pentagon or who meet the minimum monthly visit frequency.

Per reference (a), the protection of classified national intelligence information (CNSI) and sensitive, unclassified information, including information deemed critical to operations security (OPSEC), remains an unwavering imperative for the Department. Per reference (b), the Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Defense recently directed an investigation into unauthorized disclosures. While the Department remains committed to transparency, the Department is equally obligated to protect CNSI and sensitive information - the unauthorized disclosure of which could put the lives of U.S. Service members in danger. To attain professional balance between press access and OPSEC, the following updated security measures for resident and visiting press are needed to reduce the opportunities for in-person inadvertent and unauthorized disclosures.

        "article_summary": "\"The Baltimorons\" is a heartwarming Christmas rom-com centered on Cliff, a recovering alcoholic and failed comic, who forms an unexpected bond with Didi, a tough dentist, on Christmas Eve. As they navigate personal challenges and share a night of adventure, the film explores themes of connection and resilience. With strong performances from Michael Strassner and Liz Larsen, the movie offers a charming addition to holiday viewing options.",

        "text": "NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!\n\nWe're all in desperate need of a feel-good escape, especially after the horrific past couple of weeks our country has endured. Going to the movies used to serve that purpose. They still do, but perhaps the \"feel-good\" part to a lesser extent.\n\nAnd if you want to leapfrog over Halloween, Thanksgiving and everything pumpkin spice and go right into the holiday season, then look no further than IFC's Christmas rom-com, \"The Baltimorons.\"\n\nIt begins on Christmas Eve with lovable loser Cliff Cashen (Michael Strassner), a failed sketch comic and a recovering alcoholic trying to pursue a so-called \"normal\" life. That means finding work as a mortgage broker (if he passes the exam) and settling down with his fiancée, Brittany (Olivia Luccardi). Brittany does her very best keeping Cliff on the straight and narrow as he is urged by an old comedy buddy of his to perform at a Christmas Eve show, something Brittany absolutely forbids since comedy and alcohol are completely intertwined for him.\n\nA freak accident involving a loose brick at Brittany's parents' house, however, results in a dental emergency for calamity-prone Cliff. Out of desperation, he drives to the only dentist in Baltimore who answers his call. Coming to the rescue is Didi (Liz Larsen), a no-nonsense workaholic divorcee who's a bit rough around the edges.\n\n‘THE CONJURING: LAST RITES’ REVIEW: LAST RODEO, LAST FUMES\n\nCliff slowly chisels away Didi's tough exterior while in the chair between his goofy one-liners and his over-the-top fear of needles. He also showers her with compliments, but she thinks the nitrous oxide is doing the talking.\n\nDespite being an odd pairing, life seems to draw them together. Cliff gets told by Brittany that there's no more food at the dinner table, so he should pick something up (he asks himself why they couldn't just make him a plate — a good question indeed). And on top of that, his car gets towed. Meanwhile, Didi's Christmas Eve plans are scrapped after her daughter calls to say that dad (Didi's ex) and his much younger girlfriend had tied the knot earlier in the day and were throwing an impromptu reception at their house. So that means Didi will have to wait to see her daughter and granddaughter until Christmas Day. Out of kindness, Didi offers to drive Cliff to the impound lot. And knowing she doesn't have plans because he eavesdropped on her conversation, Cliff insists they get something to eat. Deep down, they both know no one should be alone on Christmas Eve.\n\nAt first, Didi is skeptical. Why does a youngish, bubbly guy like Cliff want to spend time with crotchety grandma like herself? Cliff's good nature ultimately calms her nerves. And over the course of the night, which takes them all over Baltimore, they encourage each other to face their personal obstacles — from Didi crashing her ex’s party to Cliff giving comedy another shot.\n\n‘SPLITSVILLE’ REVIEW: MAKING COMEDIES GREAT AGAIN\n\nAlthough the age dynamic between Cliff and Didi is no Harold and Maude, it may be something the average viewer could struggle to wrap their mind around. Still, Strassner and Larsen's performances and the chemistry between the two make it work.\n\nLarsen starts off as a tiny pit bull with plenty of sass to go around, but eventually her vulnerabilities slip through the cracks. She gives a moving performance, though the film truly belongs to her co-star.\n\nStrassner, who co-wrote the film, shines as the semi-autobiographical Cliff, a teddy bear of a man who balances the battle of his personal demons with his cheesy jokes that finally make Didi smile. He's really as sweet as his candied sweet potatoes he insists Didi try in the car. Strassner's vibrant, innocent sense of humor is something we haven't seen since John Candy.\n\nMACAULAY CULKIN SAYS JOHN CANDY WAS RARE HOLLYWOOD ALLY DURING TROUBLED CHILDHOOD WITH ‘MONSTER’ FATHER\n\nIt's been more than a decade since writer/director Jay Duplass made anything for the big screen, spending most of that time on various TV projects. \"The Baltimorons\" is like a homecoming of sorts for him. After all, indie comedies are how he and his brother/creative partner Mark Duplass (credited as an executive producer) have made names for themselves. Unlike their earlier films like \"Cyrus\" and \"Jeff, Who Lives at Home,\" \"The Baltimorons\" doesn't feature big-name actors. It benefits from that. Cliff and Didi feel like real people, something that might not have translated if the leads were Seth Rogen and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.\n\nCliff and Didi, total strangers at the start, embark on an emotional adventure that follows the golden rule of improv comedy: \"Yes, and.\" As Cliff explains to Didi during the show, it means going with the moment regardless of where it leads. And sometimes you land exactly where you’re supposed to be — even if you didn’t plan it.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS\n\nThe Verdict:\n\n\"The Baltimorons\" is a charming, crowd-pleasing rom-com that can spice up your roster of go-to Christmas movies. Strassner and Larsen have you rooting for Cliff and Didi from start to finish, making this film worth checking out. And if you miss it in theaters, it can be a solid streamer at home under a cozy blanket later.\n\n★★★ — SEE IT\n\n\"The Baltimorons\" is rated R for language. Running time: 1 hour, 39 minutes.

Army Secretary Dan Driscoll emphasized the need for cost-effective counter-drone solutions, while the service plans to modernize 25 brigades over the next two years and develop next-generation equipment, including a lighter tank. To fund these initiatives, the Army will cut $48 billion from unnecessary programs and has launched a $750 million fund to support innovation from small businesses.",

        "text": "The Army is expanding its use of artificial intelligence beyond drones — from wearable smart glasses that train mechanics in the field to automated defenses against swarms of cheap enemy aircraft — as leaders warn the counter-drone fight is now \"problem 1A\" for the nation.\n\nSpeaking to reporters this week, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll described a pilot program in which soldiers wearAI-enabled Ray-Ban glasses that record repair jobs and then use generative models to walk less-experienced troops through infantry squad vehicle maintenance. He said it reflects a new push to bring consumer technology into the force \"a lot more quickly\" than in the past. While Meta may have spent billions developing the glasses, the Army is testing them for about $400 a pair.\n\nGen. Randy George, the Army’s chief of staff, said the same approach applies to the Pentagon’s top emerging challenge: defending against drones.\n\n\"This is problem 1A that we’re facing as a country,\" Driscoll said, stressing that counter-drone technology must be cheap, fast and automated. \"If you think of a drone swarm … it is a nearly impossible idea for even human beings [to handle].\"\n\nAI ARMS RACE: US AND CHINA WEAPONIZE DRONES, CODE AND BIOTECH FOR THE NEXT GREAT WAR\n\nThat challenge has been underscored overseas, where advanced aircraft have been used to intercept relatively inexpensive drones. \"If you’ve got a $5,000 drone, you want a $2,000 or $3,000 or $4,000 interceptor, and that’s what we’re focused on,\" George said.\n\nLast week, Dutch F-35s and Polish F-16s deployed to take out dozens of Russian drones flying into Russian territory.\n\nGeorge added that the Army is testing proximity rounds and high-energy lasers, while the bigger hurdle is defending against drones in crowded civilian airspace.\n\nAs part of the Army’s \"continuous transformation\" initiative, George said 25 brigades will be overhauled in the next two years to make them more lethal, mobile and survivable in high-threat environments. The first armored brigade combat teams are set to rotate through the National Training Center in California this November, followed by a large-scale exercise in Hawaii.\n\nGeorge also pointed to armor modernization, saying the Army’s next-generation M1E3 tank — envisioned as a lighter, faster replacement for the Abrams — could reach units as early as next year. That would mark a major acceleration, since earlier projections suggested the vehicle would not field until the 2030s.\n\nTo pay for its modernization drive, Driscoll said the Army plans to cut $48 billion over five years from programs it no longer needs, reinvesting in drones, air defenses and long-range fires.\n\nPENTAGON UNVEILS $961B BUDGET REQUEST: FUND FOR GOLDEN DOME, MISSILES AND DRONES, FEWER F-35 JETS\n\nThe service also launched a $750 million \"Fuse\" fund to support small and mid-sized businesses and previewed new acquisition reforms to be detailed at next month’s AUSA conference. Modeled partly on the rapid iteration practices of commercial companies, the changes will co-locate soldiers, engineers and contractors to speed up design and fielding.\n\nOfficials also highlighted in-house efforts. George said the Army is now building its own drones at depots with all-American parts — including models already flying in Ukraine — to help replenish stockpiles. Driscoll said 3D printing is being tested as a way to overcome the \"tyranny of distance\" in the Indo-Pacific, allowing soldiers to fabricate parts in theater instead of waiting on long supply lines.\n\nGeorge pointed to battlefield command as another area of change. The 4th Infantry Division is now testing command-and-control apps on ruggedized tablets — replacing the trucks and racks of radios that have long anchored Army command posts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe move is designed to make headquarters smaller and harder to target, though outside experts have warned that relying on commercial-style devices could introduce new cyber vulnerabilities and durability issues in combat.\n\nDriscoll also credited President Trump with backing the Army’s overhaul. \"They’ve held the line every single time when we have made a hard decision,\" he said. Still, he acknowledged that each of the $48 billion in cuts has defenders in Congress and industry."

        "article_summary": "Bertha Zúñiga, the daughter of murdered indigenous rights activist Berta Cáceres, continues to lead the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) in advocating for the Lenca people's land rights against harmful commercial projects, despite facing numerous threats to her safety. Following her mother's assassination in 2016, Zúñiga has experienced ongoing violence and intimidation, including a recent leak of sensitive security information that heightened her concerns for her family's safety. Nevertheless, she remains committed to her cause, feeling her mother's spirit guides and protects her in the fight for indigenous rights.",
        "source": "cnn",
        "text": "Bertha Zúñiga is no stranger to threats. She remembers the day years ago when she and her colleagues were chased by machete-wielding attackers in western Honduras.\n\nA vehicle blocked their car, and its passengers stepped out with their weapons, trying to attack the group. They managed to escape, but the incident was not the first – nor would it be the last time Zúñiga would face a violent threat.\n\nThat encounter came just over a year after Zúñiga’s mother, Berta Cáceres, a prominent indigenous rights activist in Honduras, was killed in her home in March 2016, leading to Zúñiga taking the leadership of her group, the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH).\n\nZúñiga was a toddler when her mother started the group to defend indigenous Lenca land from commercial interests that local communities say harm and exploit it.\n\nZúñiga’s group has been fighting against controversial projects such as the since-paused Agua Zarca dam in northwest Honduras that activists say would cost the Lenca people their livelihood. The local community fears the hydropower station on the Gualcarque River would destroy its unique ecosystems and the community’s agricultural production areas and sources of food and natural medicine. But Cáceres’ moves against the project faced powerful pushback.\n\nEnvironmental and human rights investigative group Global Witness said that in 2023 Honduras ranked the third deadliest – tying with Mexico, behind Colombia and Brazil – for environmental defenders and had the world’s highest number of killings of environment defenders per capita.\n\nIn April 2013 Cáceres organized a road blockade in the Río Blanco region to stop the power company that owned and operated the Agua Zarca project, Desarrollos Energéticos Sociedad Anónima (DESA), from accessing the dam site. The blockade lasted over a year despite eviction attempts and violent attacks.\n\n“I began to see that it was a much more aggressive fight than we ever had in COPINH’s history,” Zúñiga told CNN. “My mom always took me to the communities, made me see what was happening and learn there in person, but she held back a lot. She didn’t want me to go to Río Blanco.”\n\nWhen Zúñiga insisted on going to the region, her mother instructed her to use her middle name and not reveal whose daughter she was.\n\nCáceres knew her work was dangerous and, from a young age, Zúñiga learned to take her safety seriously amid fears of kidnapping. Someone always had to accompany her to school and pick her up, even after she got older. She didn’t have the freedom most other children did.\n\nThe year before her murder, Cáceres sat her adult children down for a talk. “She told us that anything could happen in this country and that we should not be afraid,” Zúñiga said.\n\nA team of international legal experts who investigated Cáceres’ murder found it was not an isolated incident, but the result of a larger plot. To date, eight people have been sentenced in connection with her death, including former senior employees of DESA. The company could not be reached for comment but had previously maintained its employees’ innocence and has long denied any connection to the killing. The high-profile convictions included former executive Roberto David Castillo Mejía, who was sentenced to over 22 years, and DESA’s former environmental manager Sergio Rodríguez, who was sentenced to 30 years. Both claimed they were innocent.\n\nA large portion of water resources in Honduras are on indigenous territory, and the government often grants access to those resources to business groups without adequately consulting local indigenous communities. Corporate interests in the region often aim to quickly extract natural resources in a way that maximizes economic benefits without considering the effects on the environment and local populations, says Laura Furones, a senior adviser at Global Witness.\n\n“These local populations normally benefit little or nothing,” she told CNN.\n\nOver the years, government policies favoring the private sector and companies aiming to profit from the country’s natural resources were put in place to boost the economy after it was devastated by events like Hurricane Mitch in 1998 and the 2009 coup that ousted then-president José Manuel Zelaya.\n\nJust days after Cáceres’ death, COPINH member Nelson García was fatally shot. In January 2023, Aly Magdaleno Domínguez Ramos and Jairo Bonilla Ayala, outspoken activists against an iron ore mine, were found dead in northern Honduras. And last year, Juan López, who protested mining and hydro-electric projects, was shot dead on his way home from church.\n\nPrior to her death, Cáceres herself had her car pelted with stones, and faced shots fired into the air as a warning, Zúñiga recalls.\n\nEarlier this year, sensitive information about the security detail the Honduran government granted Zúñiga’s family after her mother’s death was leaked, signaling that nearly a decade after her mother’s high-profile killing, her family was still at risk.\n\nScreenshots of a document spread on social media, with details such as the make, model, plate number, and vehicle identification number of the car her grandmother traveled in and where it was registered.\n\nThe Honduran Special Prosecutor’s Office acknowledged the leak was an “extremely serious” breach of confidentiality, telling CNN an investigation into the leak was underway, and that the protection measures for Zúñiga and her family needed to be adapted and strengthened.\n\n“Feeling like the target of an attack isn’t easy,” Zúñiga says. “It’s not that I haven’t lived through it before, but of course I’m a bit concerned about what it might mean,” she says of the leak.\n\nJust days before the information leak, doctored photos of Zúñiga’s face with bruises and bloodstains circulated on social media – recalling the time when Zúñiga says touched-up images of her mother with devil horns spread on social media in what COPINH called a smear campaign aimed at discrediting the group’s work.\n\nYet Zúñiga isn’t deterred. She sees her fight for indigenous people’s right to their land as a cause bigger than herself or her family, and one that she feels her mother is still helping her with.\n\n“Her spirit accompanies and protects me,” Zúñiga says. “I know she’s with me.”"

These are the muscles that keep you standing tall, moving with power and living without pain.\"\n\nSuazo learned firsthand about the benefits of this training when he was swimming competitively and training in martial arts.\n\nWANT BETTER HEART HEALTH?

This is how you teach your body to brace and protect your back during everyday life.\"\n\nTWO KEY HEART HEALTH METRICS COULD DETERMINE HOW LONG YOU'LL LIVE\n\nMobility zone: Shoulders and rotator cuff\n\n\"Healthy shoulders are a must if you want to keep training for decades,\" Suazo said. \"They’re involved in almost every movement, so you need them strong and mobile.\"\n\nFor this area, the trainer recommends face pulls, rear delt flies, light band rotations and controlled overhead presses. \"This combination keeps your shoulders feeling good and moving well,\" he said.\n\nGrip zone: Hands and forearms\n\n\"Grip strength is one of the first things people lose with age, and it’s one of the most important — a strong grip keeps you independent,\" Suazo said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFarmer’s carries are his go-to for improving grip strength. Suazo recommends aiming to carry 70% of your body weight in each hand.\n\n\"Pick up weights, stand tall and walk with intention,\" he suggested. \"Hanging from a pull-up bar works, too.

Then I got her number, and we talked … it was all very old-fashioned.\"\n\nSheen added, \"I just dug her spirit, I dug her life, I dug her energy.\"\n\nCLINT EASTWOOD CONVINCED CHARLIE SHEEN TO GO TO REHAB AFTER FAMILY INTERVENTION LED BY MARTIN SHEEN\n\nSheen, 60, proposed to Mueller, 48, in 2007, and the former couple said \"I do\" in May 2008.\n\nHis former \"Two and a Half Men\" co-star, Jon Cryer, remembered not being able to attend Sheen and Mueller's wedding due to a movie shoot, but his wife went to support the couple.\n\n\"My wife called me afterwards and said, ‘Oh my God. I have concerns,’ is what my wife said,\" Cryer recalled. \"She said, ‘Ok, I just want to tell you the toast that Martin Sheen made at the wedding’ and then I braced myself.\"\n\n\"He apparently stood up, said ‘I hope you two know what you’re doing' and sat back down. That was the entirety of Martin Sheen's toast at Charlie Sheen's wedding.\"\n\nCHARLIE SHEEN FELT ‘RELIEF’ WHEN DIAGNOSED WITH HIV AFTER YEARS OF WILD, DRUG-FUELED CRAZINESS\n\nThere were many reservations surrounding their union. In a clip shared in the docuseries, Trump admitted during a 2011 sitdown with ABC that he even encouraged Mueller's parents to intervene in the relationship.\n\n\"Brooke is from Palm Beach, and I told the parents, don't let your daughter marry him. I think he's wonderful, but he's a disaster. Don't let your daughter marry him.\"\n\n\"You know how one thing leads to the next thing … and marriage and children,\" Sheen said. Brooke welcomed twins Bob and Max on March 14, 2009.\n\n\"Brooke is from Palm Beach, and I told the parents, don't let your daughter marry him. I think he's wonderful, but he's a disaster. Don't let your daughter marry him.\"\n\n— President Donald Trump\n\nThe boys were born six weeks premature, and required a prolonged hospital stay. The \"Major League\" star explained that juggling their round-the-clock care and his work on a popular TV show only facilitated a \"ton of resentment\" toward the show for not giving him time off to take care of his family.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

At the time, it was scary, man,\" Sheen said. \"I'm not placing any blame, I'm just trying to trace, kind of, the way things developed or unraveled or both.\"\n\n\"I remember the night that nine years of no crack came to a tumbling, spectacular close. She's in the bathroom with this girl and I can hear them doing blow and I start banging on the door, and I said, ‘If you’re going to do this s--- in my house, you need to stop wasting it, and you need to do it properly. Let me show you how to cook this s--- up.' And it was on.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nSheen was arrested on Christmas Day in 2009 for allegedly threatening to kill Mueller, in addition to holding a knife against her throat.\n\nMueller agreed that they \"went hard, fast\" due to their shared addiction issues resurfacing. Shortly after the arrest, she recanted her story about the incident and Sheen's charges were dropped.\n\n\"If I didn't recant my story, then he could have gotten into a lot of trouble,\" Mueller said. \"Not only was he my husband, but I was so incredibly screwed up on serious drugs for a very long time. I can't sit there and say I know for a fact this happened and this is how it happened or anything like that because of the mind.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSheen noted, \"I have my part in it, sure.
